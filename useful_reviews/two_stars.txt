mayb i miss someth about this place but after three tri i just had to stop go back hope i would final feel the magic the burger are okay but there are better one in madison 

the last time we were there my son chicken sandwich was overcook and they charg more money sinc he got it on a pretzel bun instead of the regular bun our burger were unremark  not that flavor or moist the buffalo wing were greasi and actual not hot when we got them and the last night we were there a friday at about 600 the place was full and the servic was terribl as in wait over fifteen minut after i had pile all the dirti dish at the end of the tabl as a hint that we were way done befor the server came by wonder if we want anyth els 

and somehow with four peopl no alcohol drink two appet and four sandwich our bill was over 70 that us dollar befor the tip they charg extra for everyth  ranch on the side chees on a burger  everyth for a realli margin meal and lousi servic that was way too much moneymonti is one of the mani mindboggl food fight restaur that is a madison favorit despit serv mediocr food 

ive eaten one good dish here the tnt blt tempeh and tomato and the chocol shake is good if you need to consum an extraordinari number of calori on ani given day

th last time i went i did so becaus a friend told me the restaur is attempt to make a switch to more sustainabilityconsci organ food i order chili that was pretti much ined on anoth night my boyfriend order a soup that was again ined 

i can imagin that peopl like to come here becaus the restaur resembl an oldschool diner and has booth which are fun for kid to sit in but the food qualiti is general averag to poor the brunch ive had is tasteless and limit and you are not get fresh egg unless you order them over easi 

the onli reason i give monti two star is becaus it pie are great and onc in a while i can stomach a tnt blt becaus someon im with persuad me to give monti one    more    triooooohhhh
haaahaaa wow
no
nop 
never again3510
mi second attempt to dine here as it was so busi the first time and so noisi that i had to leav  it was dure lunch hour and i dont like to wait  arriv a few minut shi of the end of lunch so i was abl to dine in peac  order the tofu green curri and the fri banana and coconut ice cream for dessert  i found the portion of the entre to be veri skimpi for the price and ive had much tastier and creamier curri sauc elsewher totti thai eleph even yupha  need i say more  serious wts green curri tast about the same as thai hut but at a portion that about half or less of what i could get at th or ani of the other place ive visit but i suppos the atmospher is what im pay for here  that said i must admit that the fri banana dessert was delici  love the toast coconut on top well on top of the banana but under the syrup top coconut ice cream whip top and maraschino cherri  on my next visit when im crave for someth sweet i will ask to have the syrup top whip cream and cherri omit  the dish is perfect wout them8 for a well vodkaton at majerl are you serious 

i havent paid that much for a well drink except for fanci resort and pricey bar in la or nyc  that drink and a tall blue moon last night came out to a ludicr 16 befor tip perhap this is special highway robberi price for unsuspect nba all star visitors

tv are awkward place but the expos brick lend a timeworn atmospher to this cozi sport bar  16 just isnt worth it though too mani other bar in the vicin to wast your timeso i went to a late lunch with the mom this weekend 

one plop me out and the other is her bff that been around long befor i was do boomboom and creat crayon masterpiec on the wall 

they want salad somewher downtown and all the place ive never been to but have been want to go to for age were either close or green free lolo collard dont count palatt cheuvront cibo my florist and so on

so mom decid that coach and willi was the perfect luncheon destination

cuz they thought the salad onlin look purdi tasti and they were right but i shouldnt have judg a book by it cover sinc even mcdonald look pretti good in commercials

so i swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to coach and willi i thought the name sound like a bastard love filli to a poni express stud or mayb some purebr dog name like sir charl mcwigglesworth

easi to find park was plenti patio was neato sunken bar seem like a novelti horsesho shape booth were comfi and invit atmospher was upscaley for a sport bar compani was vivaci waitress was engag and attent bacon wrap prawn were succul and satisfi my woodchuck cider was tast crisp and peari and i had a big ole smile on my face

it was salad time 

now if a salad cost ten dollar i expect more than a tasteless expans of iceburg lettuc what head chef use iceburg lettuc ani more with all the varieti of salad green to chose from i end up with the tasteless tacki trailer trash of the field green world im not say you gotta get all pretenti with a salad by use micro green grown in an organ hot hous but for fuck sake iceburg airplan and cafeteria are the onli place ive ever encount iceburg not in fanci pant wedg salad form which class it up some and acknowledg the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrient of ani sort

i coach and willi food compar to airplan fare ahem yes my salad was anyway everyon els seem to enjoy their despit the offens iceburg i just ate the equal tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and pick around the lettuc filler so while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrap prawn were rockin the salad suck and sinc ive onli been here onc they get a less than stellar review and im state that straight up so nobodi get all persnicketi ive onli been onc for lunch and a crap salad

im sure it a fun place for drink befor a game or for a quick lunch with cowork but im take a stand against iceburg lettuc it should be elimin on principl alon asid from it use as filler see navajo taco and garnish

anybodi want to join my one woman campaigni book my birthday parti here most becaus of it close proxim to the duce i was in contact with someon who said she was the manag daron harvey she was great and said she would extend happi hour for my parti howev upon arriv the night of my parti the manag on duti had no idea my parti was come when i told him that i had spoken to a manag about have my parti there and he snide remark that weird im the manag wow way to be nice about the amount of busi i am about to bring your bar to top it off we got there at 9pm which is what i told the manag i was email just to find out they normal close at 10pm on nonsun game night unless they have 20 peopl so now i feel awkward caus were keep these server past the time that they probabl thought they were go home 

the onli reason i am not give them one star is that they were still abl to accommod my parti and give us the special except after 15 hour of be there the server ask me if were all on separ check i dont understand how you just assum these thing and we had to wait a bit longer to get our tab last i get the rule to add gratuiti for such a big parti but the gratuiti ad was 22 random 

such a terribl experii realli enjoy the atmospher howev the food is wors than a microwav dinner i think the buy bing bag of stirfri from costco

w got there and they didnt seat us for 30min when there were tabl then we got seat and didnt get the food for 1 and a half hour 

we kept tri to grab the witress but she would avoid us then we would ask oth waitress and they said the would check

peopl were come and go that got there after us

fin i got aggress with our waitress and we saw her walk to the chef and put in our order

sh forgot to put in our order

sinc she want to pretend like it was just take a long time she fuck the whole order up becaus she was go off memori and couldnt ask us becaus then we would know

th food came final and it was all crap we didnt even order

w told her to forget the whole thing we are leav and not paying

sh grab her manag who told us 

she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there i can take it off the bill but there is a good chanc we will get her fire or the waitress will pay for half out of her pocket

wtf

of cours i told her the whole meal need to be free and it was extrem unprofession that she would blame a waitress get fire becaus we wait a total of 2 hrs for the wrong meal we didnt eat

it would have been rate a zero star but i gave it 2 becaus now they are a bar too and that portion is pretti cooli know a lot of my friend realli like this place but i just cant get over the bad servic and the food realli isnt that great it realli close to my hous so i go a lot to hang out and listen to the music that they have come through serious though i have stop eat there becaus i realiz after the 4th time that i have had digest issu everi time i eat there no joke 

when i did eat there the food realli wasnt that great usual a bite or two is good then it just get realli gross ive tri about everi side item that they offer with there entre and they are all pretti gross to me as well the potato salad was the onli thing that i actual thought was okay and one time i went there and she list off my choic for side i said chip her oh were actual out of chip me soup her were out of that too now me so realli what are my actual choic her salad 

sorri to all my friend who like it but it realli not that great i think peopl come in and are charm by the homey innerc art dive feel it hasi start a new job and the boss brought us here for lunch  it was ok  i got a lunch combo meal but i didnt pay
th servic was realli great but the food was not  just kind of plain  
it conveni to work so i will probabl be back i just wont have veri high expectim piss how can you just stop make grill chees it bread and chees how you have bread and you have chees but you cannot make a grill cheese

also whi doe it have to be 400 degre i know you have ac this is az in the summer it hot turn it on

i dont have a realli good basi to draw this conclus becaus i rare order this drink but your dirti vodka martini is quit possibl the worst i have ever tast i had to eat a chees stick with each bite just to stomach it

your tater tot were good and my blue moon was reason price at least you have that go for youfor review 200 i want to take someth from my bookmark list i was downtown for the herberg theater and pass by the old spaghetti factori i use to visit the osf in atlanta and when i live in ohio i rememb alway enjoy the experience

nostalgia is better than reality

mi friend order the fettuccini alfredo and i went with the garlic mizithrawhich is a twist on the standard mizithra chees  spaghetti plate i typic order this ad garlic mushroom and bacon the food was good but fair averag the portion were smaller than i rememb 

the sourdough bread was good  still warm the restaur open in 1972 and i think they have been make salad the same way sinc day 1 it was an iceberg lettuc classic and although i order blue chees it arriv with vinaigrett rather than send it back i kept the salad 

perhap i arriv close to a shift chang but there appear to be 2 manag on duti both stop by the tabl multipl time to ask is everyth fantast  the waiter stop by sever time as well and said is everyth excel i like to be check on occasion but too much is annoy  

anoth annoy aspect was the food had been on the tabl about 10 minut and still was 34 full the waiter came back and ask if we need box or were we still work on it umy still work  mayb it was becaus it was 530 and the lobbi was crowd with other wait but i hadnt been there that long  and three minut later when he pop back over and ask again if we were finish well you just earn yourself a small tip and a long guest becaus my show didnt start for anoth 90 minut and i didnt have anyth to do deal with it 

final i allow him to take the plate away and we were brought complementari spumoni  i have to say that was the best part of the entir meal afterward i swung by the restroom and that was a charm experi  big open urin  at least it wasnt like the old pee trough some place use to have  but there it was  a full restroom of guy look like a locker room i didnt know my spaghetti came with sausag yuck

overal  31 for a hope soon forgett dine experi  the servic from the waiter and the manag was annoy and the meal averag at best  some memori are best kept as that i dont think i need to revisit this restaur ani time soonoverpr and underimpressed

whil the wait staff is friend courteous and veri effici the food suck  i paid over 10 for a shrimp salad that was 1 head of dress butterleaf lettuc 10 crouton a few slice cherri tomato and 8 shrimp  not marin as promis  a joke of a salad

everi time we visit this establish per the behest of visit parent im less and less impressed

next time the folk are in town well be seek out a differ restauri went here despit yelper tell me not to bother  what did i get  an overpr bland sandwich confus at the menu and feel awkward in the locat  

it an uppiti cafeteria that make you want to believ that their food is good for you but it not dont make the same mistak i didsunday 620pm downtown follow anoth amaz mercuri victori  hungri  group includ toddler wed like to walk to food but it warm so we cant walk far  it sad how few option actual present themselv  we tri coach and willi first but as of 610 their kitchen was close  so we were led back to hard rock cafe

 been here sever time after game and all for the same reason  it close we didnt feel like park again the food is ok  think applebe for a few buck more  but servic unfortun has been a regular issue

on of the last time we were there we advis our server that we need to be out the door in 45 minut  we ask what food we could order to ensur that it would be fast  to his credit he check in the kitchen  after immedi order a sandwich and salad the food arriv 5 minut befor we were suppos to walk out the door with no apolog and a server who hid from us for most of that time we were 15 minut late leav just tri to get togo contain and our bill  

this time  our servic was actual wonder  our server was great  happi convers refil drink much more than usual though the place was quit busi with postgam activ  the problem came when she had to leav to move her car you see with dback and merc game park was expens and full so she had to park sever block away where the gate close prompt at 8pm which we total understood  and even though we all saw her hand us off to the manag after hand us the check she point to our tabl sever time no one came to our tabl  well after flag down a hostess a bus boy and anoth server who all said they would look for the manag and we did see them scurri around look for the manag it took 25 minut to find her and have her walk over to the tabl  that 25 extra minut with a toddler who was get tire how much did we love that final as our waitress walk back into the build 30 minut after she left we were final pay our bill and leav the tabl  she was so apologet   she was wonder  the fact that we heard from sever folk there that wait 20 minut to find the manag was not out of the norm was scari 

they have such an amaz locat in the heart of the action after event  their food is decent enough that id be will to grab someth there again pure for conveni if onli i knew what to expect when it came to the servic  but unfortun  i cantduck and decant is surpris uninspir food  i wouldnt recommend this as a meal for a downtown diner unless your choic are down to this and quizno  my prosciutto sandwich was dread bore equal to someth youd probabl get in a nice fancyp hospit like the mayo clinic  there it would be awesom but here as a downtown stapl is not noteworthi whatsoevfive dollar and thirti cent for a pull pork sandwich with a side of sauc sorri honey bear but im not feel you whi oh whi did i go on a day when they didnt serv catfish which i love from here perhap when i blow off some steam over a sandwich this small with no side dish cost over 5 ill return for your fish fri until then see yai just cannot understand whi this place is so high rate could it be that peopl have never experienc barbequ outsid of arizona so they have no basi of comparison but even that cannot be true we have joe in gilbert and even famous dave is pretti darn good 

i work a block from this locat so i have been there at least a dozen time while not great it is someth differ onc in awhil so i put in an appear now and then the food is not bad per se it is just not that good the price on the other hand are far too high for what you get 11 get you a larg sandwich which is not veri larg an order of fri and a sodarc brand for a coupl of buck more i could get a combo platter at famous dave 

servic is all busi i dont think i have ever seen a smile in the place but it is fast the place is usual dirti but i am usual there right around lunch so it might be better other time 

just not impress at all butit beat the burger king down the street which is the worst bk in christendom but that is anoth reviewstop in last week for what i thought would be a trip down memori lane a real genuin bbq place here in downtown phoenix 

this place was so offbas it actual made me frown 

mayb ive flown too high real bbq for me was from an old man everyon call knuckl on the side of the road in south carolina sit in a lawn chair next to a smoker paint like a pig 

i order the 12 lb barbecu pork with two side i tri the mac and chees as well as the cole slaw 

the pork was tough and had no smoke flavor whatsoev the mac and chees was wateri to the point where i want to ask if they pour in water recent the cole slaw was ok just bland the sauc was alright

i order a sweet tea becaus come on this is a barbecu place the cashier told me they had rc product no sweet tea get out of here

riv cuomo the cashier overcharg me for almost twice my meal i just left and didnt go back it wasnt even worth get my money backmeh

cant believ im go to say this but

so forget cheuvront just go to kazmirez

atleast at kaz you get ampl varieti when you order the fruitchees tray at cheuvront you get a minut amount of chees onli two type with hard ani fruit or nut forget it not worth it not after have kazmirez fruitchees tray noth els can compar 

i tri a viogner by the glass and it was the worst viogner ive ever had also good to know their bottl servic is pricey you can guy a 17 bottl of wine there and take it to go good deal or pay 35 for the same bottl to drink it at the restaur uhmm wow 

i feel for my date he bought a glass of wine 1 bottl of wine and 1 small cheesefruit tray and it come to around 100 that my friend is the definit of absurdsix month ago i wouldv written a glow review about how cheuvront is fill with everyth amaz  from their wonder server to the beer the chees the wine and the food

then i came in to have a drink with my brown boy after pick up my man wig for halloween  we got there at 3 pm the place was complet empti  the bartend mention that happi hour start at 4 and gave us the menu to glanc at  see as we had an hour we just had a few beer to start and to tide us over until happi hour

th beer was papago orang blossom which is glorious  then happi hour roll around and my friend decid he want mojito  so eventu i get one as the last drink and just ask the server which mojito they had and i chose the pomegran one  the mojito were good the mango one tast like dessert a littl over sweet

again everyth is cool until the check arriv  they charg us the normal 8 for the pomegran mojito instead of the happi hour price  i ask the manag and he just give me a blank stare and tell me it wasnt on the happi hour menu  i briefli glanc at the happi hour menu and i didnt take inventori of all the item on it  he decid not to be cool about it and left it on the bill

i know time are tough around here but when you charg those high price 650 for a pint and then screw over your custom absolut ridicul  you lost a long time custom and fanas you might be abl to tell from my schizophren chang star for this place my experi have vari  some thing that do not ever chang with my latest experi in parentheses
they seem to carri onli the tastiest wine  pascual toso reserv malbec 08
their chees are also amaz amaz  american plate w buzz from utah and a perfect age gouda
their food is great  lasagna

however
th kitchen ran out of pizza macchees which is what i want and lasagna luckili i made the cut  that easili half their menu  we subsequ had to chang our order twice as the bad news kept roll in  by the end of the night our poor server was like the angel of death sinc each time i saw him i got nervous that he was go to come tell me that whatev it was i had order was yet again 86ed
then the food that we were abl to order took over 45 minut to show up
then the revers happi hour cocktail were inconsist differ color pomegran margarita one pineappl cosmo that tast great but a 2nd that had a coffe flavor  which they glad replac for a good tast one

overal i end up pay way too much for a lacklust experi  what realli peev me off was that i had recommend this place to our parti of 14 with the hope that i could show them how awesom place in cenpho are sinc theyr all suburbanites

so thank you cheuvront for make me look like a fool and give my friend one more reason to stay in the burb  ive driven past this place mani time on the way to sun or dback game  everi time i pass by it look like a fun place to go hang out  i final had the opportun to do so dure a confer in downtown phoenix  one of the compani at the confer host a parti here

th parti was stage in the patio area as you enter the restaur  the compani who host the parti was give away complimentari cigar so i understand whi they had it outdoor  the weather was perfect so it was a good time of the year to do it  the place was pack too  so whi the 2 star  here why

 they serv wine out of a liquor guny they do  when i went up to the bar on the patio and ask for a glass of cabernet the bartend told me you have to go insid becaus we dont have the handl with the winei thought she was kid and i said im sorri i dont think you understand i ask for a glass of cabernet  you dont have ani bottl back therethat when she confirm what i heard and said no you heard me right we serv wine out of a handlelin and sinc were a smaller bar outsid you have to go insid to get itwhat the hell  the wine tast like what you would expect wine from a tap to tast like

 the restroom are like gas station restroom  theyr locat out next to the bar on the patio and they are just like gas station restroom in that theyr too small and dirti  they couldnt handl the crowd of peopl at the party

 servic is slow  the line at the bar was 30 peopl deep for each line 2 line  there were onli 2 bartend to servic 200 peopl  it took 20 min to get a drink

 the parti felt like a hous parti in someon backyard  plastic cup plastic furnitur you had to bus your own tablether were no busperson or anyon to clean up  bizzaroworld

overal not a good experi  mayb if i was a young 20 yr old it would be coolnot now

return factor  5i have been lucki to get realli good servic at most locat i dine atthat whi peopl call me lucki they dont so when i get bad servic a general ok experi becom anyth but ok let buy a ticket and check out alic cooperstown

fuddrink
generalbarfar that make it realli simpl for everyon now they have some interest food option yes but there is noth special whi elabor further alic joint onli offer greasi fri food option with littl time put into the prepar of said item  for a footbal event i went to they were offer breakfast i order a cheeseegg quesadilla which was edibl fill with greas i had second thought after order it but was hungri meh of the two stand out item on their menu the 22 inch hotdog name the big unit is a big hit it big yesbut that where it end you pay 17 for a big hotdog guysit realli noth much to write home about whi pay that if go to the dback game whi not get one or two 1 dog at chase just say i must say the other item on the menu that stood out was the catcher mitt browni for 499 you get a huge warm browni plus a scoop of ice cream everyon at the tabl was impress 

as for drink they realli are just overpr i know they have rent i get it but serious 650 for a draft that isnt close to a pint horribl price decis i wouldv had an extra beer but this turn me off immedi noth els to say just too expens for what you are getting

atmosphereservice
atmospher is ok it could be so much better the insid is fun on the surfac and they have some cool memorabilia hang upit is nice to see what alic put out for us to view but overal the bar is there for larg group to gather and talk no extra fluff when each big unit come out an obnoxi loud ring bell sound and the bar staff yell out a chant after a good 30 ring i was save by the bell when my footbal game end as for servic we were the first tabl to be sat and had anywher between 38 peopl at given time servic was consist slow despit the fact the bar was at about 12 capac for most of the day i had to flag down our waitress a coupl time to get servic and rememb that browni i talk about earlier well it sat on our tabl for 2 hour after be finish it was still on the tabl when i had began leav so servic was bad realli hit the nail on the head there was no reason whi we shouldnt have been wait on more especi sinc we had the largest group in the joint that day poor servicemeh

extrasrating
overal it not the best option for grab a drink and bite befor game downtown i have made suggest for other locat and those suggest stand they get 2 star for locat and a nice array of tvs for game day they lose 3 star for poor servic poor price for qualiti and underwhelm ambianc they can do so much betterand until they chang thing you can do so much better as wellwho put celeri in chili

no french fries

carrot and raisin salad on the menu

cut oldfashion decor but realli i just want to dust the placethis was my third time and probabl last  the servic was terribl no particular server assign so therefor no one to check on us our dirti dish from lunch were still on the tabl when ice cream soda dessert arriv 

i guess manag did not anticip be busi the sunday dure memori weekendi love macalpin it in my neighborhood
i get the whole vibe with that be said 
they need to get a touch realist they are becom over price it thrifti ice cream 
not ben and jerri im not complain 
but when a sandwich ice tea and a ice cream is cost 1750  then 2100 with
tip i  think it a littl too much  just sayi stop in here to give it a tri for lunch today  found it to be ok look insid  it a littl bang up but a lot of decor make it kind of comfort  homey  they have well place booth for seat as well as tabl  from there on unfortun it was most downhill

  there were no paper towel in the bathroom

  my tabl was dirti with lot of crumb  other food stuck to it from the previous diner

  it too expens for this kind of place  a combo with a chile relleno enchilada  a taco cost 10

  the servic took forev  over half an hour between the time i order  when i receiv all of my food  the taco show up ala cart at around the 25 minut point

  i had to chase down the waitress  ask to get ani napkin  silverwar  this was way out past when the taco had arriv  my hand were all greasy

  there was not onli a tv on but there were rock oldi play over the pa system  then pretti soon there was a jukebox blare mexican music out on top of everyth els  what a cacophoni  hey  peopl are tri to eat in here

y the food was pretti good but that the onli thing save this place from a 1 star rate  there were too may problem  i wont be return     this one is realli hard 

base on other yelp review i went to eliana to pick up lunch last week it close to my work and it sound like such a nice departur from my usual lunchtim round this past weekend my boyfriend and i went to dinner there becaus i thought it deserv a second tri ill tell you a littl about both experi 

after perus all of the most help and honest review here i realli psych myself out about give it a tri and just had to go there for takeout that veri same day  im not a delay gratif kind of person despit my best effort i end up at the restaur at around 1100 and it was empti the ladi behind the counter seem a littl frosti at first but then she start in with call me mija and i was a goner im not sure whi but some littl older ladi call me a term of mother endear alway soften me right up 

i order the pollo encebollado describ in the menu onli as chicken with onion hm well i like chicken and i like onionssothat sound pretti good i was imagin someth akin to an el salvadorian fajita as i pick up my order and drove back to work to enjoy it at my desk vision of chunk of season chicken and saute onion danc through my head i settl down at my desk took a deep breath open the nice wrap styrofoam contain andchicken on the bone what who said anyth about chicken on the bone with some reddish tomatoeylook sauc what is this where are the delici unauthent strip of white meat chicken the brown onion all oili and slipperi this isnt fajita 

well no it isnt fajitasfajita are somewher els on the menu this is pollo encebollado and i didnt know what i was order pollo encebollado at eliana is two drumstick cover in a flavor tomatobas sauc pair with a few cook onion slice the meal includ rice bean and tortilla but i went for doubl rice which is kind of yellow in color and stud with chop carrot and onion the tortilla are like fat littl pancak that tast like tortilla if that not a complet ignor descript 

i dont general eat chicken on the bone but hey i order it i was realli want to tri it so i broke a person rule and dove in while it wasnt quit what i had imagin i like it well enough and was abl to finish it 

i wasnt sure what to think i wasnt too into itdefinit not enough to order that same thing again but i didnt want to write eliana off complet base mere on some weird prissi arbitrari issu i have with chicken on the bone 

i told my boyfriend about the restaur and suggest that we go tri it out togeth he had actual heard of it befor from a salvadorian cowork who rave about it frequently

w went on a friday even at around 500the restaur was again near empti a veri friend man seat us and took our drink orders

 i first tri the orchata which was veri differ from the mexican varieti im sure most of us are familiar with it was actual a milki brown in color rather than whiteit look to me like a glass of chocol milk the color i found out later come from the addit of an ingredi call morrow seed it also tast a littl differ in a way that is hard to explainid also probabl chalk that up to the morrow seed 

for our entre my boyfriend had the chile relleno and i order the arroz a la valencianamost becaus it is paint on the outsid of the restaur and seem to be their hallmark dish 

note befor your order arriv you receiv a salti littl cup of chicken soup i wasnt too into the soup itself but i was odd touch by the effort to add a littl someth extra and a littl someth nice to the dine experi mayb im a sappi weirdo well not mayb i definit am but between the mija and the cute littl soup i felt veri charm by the man and woman work there and realli realli want to enjoy my food so i could write a big long review on yelp about how wonder their restaur is 

neither my boyfriend or i realli enjoy either of our dish my dish was serv cold which i wasnt expect and seem veri flavorless to meother than the unusu tast of banana i seem to pick up from the rice the man help us suggest that i pour the bean substanc on my dish to creat a new flavor i thought this was also a realli cute thing to say but unfortun i follow his advic and did not enjoy the new flavor i creat all in all i enjoy the arroz a la valenciana much less than the pollo encebollado

annnnd im out of charact if you want to hear about the chile relleno or the ensalada beverag messag methe look and tast of organ food without ani of the philosophi behind itand the bread is veri difficult to sink your teeth into

i knowi knowi just berat your favorit sandwich shop but realli this is your favorit place becaus either 1 your option are so limit in the area or 2 you requir a feel of prestig to eat

it good to be organ the ingredi tast delici i dont even mind pay 10 for a vegetarian sandwich that tast good albeit difficult to eat and a water for lunch but what bother me is the mix messag that more like fals advert 

first there is no place to sit insid at all so chanc are your get this meal togo with all the packag that entail there outdoor seat that is share with cafe lux fair trade cafe that awesom but similar expens seat is not avail at typic eat time and line may be long

second you cannot order a beverag from the us mexico or anywher that it might arriv in even a remot sustain way all their drink are from itali there no option for fountain drink or even local bottl water if you ask for a drink that hasnt travel 5000 mile to be here they point you to a water cooler  in the cafe next door

third the servic suck there are plenti of peopl work there almost trip over each other polit tri to not infring of anyon  space  by tri to use the cash register

fourth  the decor is design to make you feel like it sustain from recycl organ materi they even offer an organ tote bag for sale 10  this is their attempt to offer a solut for all the wast creat by the perpetu togo it almost like theyr laugh at you call you an idiot  we can call this the bleed heart tax if you forgot your recycl togo bag at home they can give you anoth one for the price of two meals

fifth and final the bread is hard to eat so you cant take a bite of your sandwich without it fall apart a bit there are no silverwar to save you from the embarrass of use your hand the wrap is brown paper with veri thick wax paper line so you cant use it to wrap around your sandwich to keep it togeth while your tri to tear piec of the bread off with your teeth

but they give you a sweet with everi orderand if you decid to come back with your empti glass bottl from itali they will recycl it for you  and if you start come here regular you will look veri hip when the peopl who work there rememb your name order and the fact that you do not requir a boutiqu togo bag

id eat from there again if you pick up the order and return the empti italian bottl for mei visit gd dure the light rail pub crawl when we walk in my crew head straight to the bar the bar was almost empti so we sat down and wait to be acknowledg by the bartend and we waitedand wait until final i had to get rude and say can we get some servic here or no the tender look at us like we had just appear there out of thin air ok i will let that pass mayb she was overwhelm we order our beer and i had to catch her to get a coupl menus then i had to yell to her that we were readi did she just not want our money that day were they full up on cash i order the pasti appet while my partner order hot wing and a basket of chip my pasti was tasti i was starv so im not sure about authent or flavor they were tasti and hot on the insid i thought they were ok i had to ask for anoth round of drink for us even though our empti glass were stare our love bartend right in the face 

i dont know if one goe to gd for a great dine experi but we were thirsti and want beer as well so our servic fell short there too i was told that a good time to go is in the even and not to sit at the bar ill tri that if i ever visit gd againive alway want to tri this place after i heard their weird radio commerci a few year back  it alway crack me up whenev the guy talk about the banger and mash  we final stop by one day after a love littl trip on the lightrail

th entranc is a littl confus be on the south side of the build  i guess this is becaus i am use to entranc be in the front of build as oppos to on the side  when you walk in you see everyth you expect  a coupl pool tabl dingi floor a seedi look bar and tabl and chair scatter about  there are a decent amount of booth as well  one thing that i notic and consid a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaur seem to be sort of partit off for the fanci dine area  i dont know if that is the case but it definit look that way  when it come down to it this place is a classic tacki pub type restaur and i like it

unfortun the food is not so great  neither is the bitchi servic you get when you come in  a half smile would be a welcom gestur instead of a perfect view of my server skulk in the kitchen  im not sure what was up with that  mayb pms  the husband order the banger and mash and i got the cornish pasti  the husband mention that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravi but he seem to enjoy his meal  me on the other hand not so much  my gigant pile of pea that kept roll of my plate were cold and had a few hair in them  they definit werent mine i check  the pasti was delici and i realli like it but the accompani mash potato were too thick and lumpi to be ani good

thi place just isnt good enough  hair in food is just plain gross  mediocr food combin with rude servic is not go to get me to come back  besid i am sick and tire of hear the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail be a detriment to his busi  i dont know how you can say that when the place is pack on a sunday afternoon with no sport event go onmeh

that realli suck compar  what happen to this place

when i came here a few year ago befor my wife and i were marri i thought this place tast greatsimilar to fresh choic in california  when my wife and i land in the phoenix area last juli we came here for dinner and i was struck by more of a sens of mediocr than befor  

after come here a week ago we found that it has gotten wors  we all realli had a hard time find someth here we like  the salad was mediocr the panini was a doughbal and the mac and chees might as well have been syrup of ipecac as far im concerned

on the senat bean soup was good out of all of the thing i tri  the woman clear the tabl was nice and we at least left her a tip

thi use to be my daughter favorit restaur  now she doesnt even want to come here again  that say a lot to mestill tri to find my goto noodl bowl place after visit yoshi this place look diveish but some of the best dish come from place that look just like this we went through the drivethru around 8pm last wednesday the insid look close as the chair were all stack on the tabl but the drivethru was buzz 

mi friend and i both got the yakisoba noodl bowl with chicken i also order an order of gyoza both bowl and gyoza came to 1100 with tax pretti decent price i thought 

we got back to my hous open up the white wine and camp out on the couch with our dinner the sauc was pretti good kind of a citrus soy the noodl were good even if averag veggi and chicken were okay too i guess the whole bowl was just okay i was realli crave the noodl and it shouldnt be hard to make good noodl at a noodl place the gyoza were alright too kind of crunchi around the edg the sauc serv with them were good though 

all in all not my dream dinner but just okay would probabl drivethru again if i was in the area and didnt feel like cook that nightive never truli understood the oregano allur it a chain with the same menu and product in everi locat there is alway a wait for tabl and rare a seat at the bar this is good for them but not for me 

i find their food averag at best the pizza is great but everyth els on the menu is subpar i order the salad yesterday and it was the ass end of a head of romain you know all the yellow bit no one want to eat with a few soggi crouton and cucumb i ate less that a ¼ of it i also got the meatbal that were dous in chees to make up for their dryness but they werent fool anyon 

our server was great and they do have a nice patio but with so mani great authent locat in phoenix i doubt i will be backi stop in at karsh today for the first time the servic i receiv was super friend and the young man behind the counter insist i tri a raspberri rugelach it was pretti tasti so i took home a loaf of seedless rye one of my favorit a black  white cooki and 2 cupcak 

befor i move to arizona i work as a bread baker in a restaur then in a bakeri much like karsh and then final manag a bakeri that made all natur and premium product more like tammi coemj bread so i recogn immedi what karsh was use both cupcak were made from a mix the fudgi frost is a commerci product i know i use it the white frost is made with veget shorten not butter the black  white cooki was like no black  white i have ever had it was so thick and cakey not at all a crisp cooki neither my husband nor i care for it the rye bread bare tast of rye although it had a decent textur it was pretti heavi on the white flour ive had better from frys

for me karsh was a big disappoint imho local no one bread match mjs and no one bake good match tammi coemy babi sister and i were pregnant at the same time last year and my famili was thrill at the coincid so imagin my crush disappoint when my pregnanc turn life threaten and i was sent to good samaritan hospit for bed rest at onli eighteen week  that meant i was go to miss my littl sister babi shower   that made me incred sad  what made me even sadder was her tear explain to me that the babi shower her bossi mother in law was organ for her was a hotass mess and that her mother in law was refus to provid a cake for the shower

ah ha i thought  i can save the day from my hospit bed and provid a kick ass cake for her babi shower  yay  

so i call karsh becaus they have some of the most yummytast cake ive ever tast  well my first call to karsh didnt go so well becaus the first employe i spoke to didnt seem too interest in help me at all it was close to close time appar so i decid to call back the next day  on my second call to karsh i reach an employe who said he was a manag so i explain to him that i was stuck in the hospit but that i would like to order a babi shower cake for my littl sister babi shower in a coupl of week and that i would pay for it over the phone with my credit card and that my husband would pick it up for me the day of the shower  he said he would be happi to help me with this order  i told him what size i need and what flavor wed like for the cake and then he ask me about a decor for the cake and i told him that her babi shower theme was babi turtl and babi owl and mayb could they do someth with that theme in mind  he said sure and i assum that deal with a profession bakeri and all that theyd do someth nice within those paramet  

holi mari mother of god was i dead wrong about that


you see the day of the shower arriv and my husband ran over to karsh bakeri and pick up the cake and trust me it wasnt a cheap cake and then he brought that big pink bakeri box over to my hospit room so that when my littl sister pop in to see me befor go to her shower i could surpris her with a beauti cake to take to her party

wel let me tell you what my husband open the tape seal the edg of that pink bakeri box so i could get a sneak peek and my face just froze in an express of utter horror  the idiot who decor her cake over at karsh bakeri went and print out an ugli black and green edibl imag of a giant sea turtl and plaster that monstros across the front of my sister babi shower cake  and then in teeni tini pink letter at the bottom of the photograph wrote welcom babi emma

i have never cri so hard in my life  i think my nurs were worri i was go to go into labor i was so upset and sob  serious i was a wreck


i was crush  it was the ugliest most disastr mess youv ever seen  i serious cri for hour and i couldnt even look at my littl sister when she came to my room to see what the big surpris was that i had for her that day  i hid my face in my pillow quiet sob and pretend to be sleep when she came by

it was the most unprofession thing youv ever seen    

we should have taken a pictur of it for the cake wreck blog but i was so distraught that i didnt want to look at it anymore

mi famili still put on a brave face and took that monstros to her babi shower while i hid in my hospit room and sob and while everyon who saw it all agre it was hideous they also said it was quit delici  

thank my sister was quit a good sport about it and thank me profus for the gestur  i think she knew my intent were good

so there you have it take it for what it worth  karsh make delici cake as long as you dont mind your ador babi shower cake look like some jacqu cousteau natur photograph out of a dusti old circa 1960s textbook with some tini unprofession greet pipe out frost at the bottom of the ridicul photographa jewish girl walk into a oh wait i am write a restaur review and not a jap joke

when scott first open mani year ago it was realli good and had a lot more competit than it doe now in those day there was katz deli sever miracl mile locat chompi and a few other ill fate place anyon rememb hollywood deli i current live in one of the best food mecca of the west coast and cant get realli good jewish deli saul is not great folk and no i have not tri miller yet 

when mom and grandma pick me up from the airport i had suggest we stop at scott to give them a tri on the way to sun citi none of us had been there in sever year and i was realli excit at a prospect for a delici hot pastrami sandwich on rye we got there walk in and i notic that the place itself look a bit run down and dare i say a littl dirti the owner are the same but the guy behind the counter who use to be friend and hamish just sat there like a schlub we were direct to a tabl and i immedi notic how larg their menu was i order my sandwich sad assum that my regular hot pastrami would be a hot and b on karsh rye sinc karsh is right next door neither was the case when my sandwich arriv and the pastrami was not delici and i ask the waitress if i was mistaken given the lean type of pastrami and she said i was not mom had a tongu sandwich and thought it was okay but she is not as picki bitchi as i am and grandma had blintz which did not look homemad but that of the frozen varieti i hope i am wrong here servic was fair not warm and not quit the ny attitud that pass in these type of establishments

aft our experi i will no longer suggest scott and will have them drive direct to chompito be fair ive onli eaten there onc  tonight  and all i had was a salad and brought my own wine  still my tab  27   ouch  

i can appreci a corkag fee but im scratch my head in a way it wasnt a 100 bottl more like 10  the staff didnt open it touch it  decant it chill it pour it  they might have not even seen it but for my asking

a for the salad it was good but noth one cant make at home for a few dollar  green appl slice a few fig and some bit of rock chees or sub ani blue     

combin with the corkag i thought it was overpr and easili replic for a portion of the cost

likewis my friend had the brie chees appet which was pretti much a big chunk of brie serv with bread and fruit   it look great tast great but honest is someth one can put togeth after a shop trip to tjs  

it a charm place nice staff and i can see how it popular  and as mention ive onli gone onc so mayb the entre will prove to be outstandnope nope nope

i came here on the recommend of other fellow yelper and i am so disappointed

first park is a mess  next i came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they dont have a high chair that can accommod a two year old so she had to use a booster seat  the problem is that shes at that middl age where shes almost done with high chair and still too immatur for a booster seat  what a mess tri to keep her in her booster seat and contain  she wasnt noisi or bad behav per se she just want to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottl on the tabl  also can i mention that the booth have a weird half wall that obscur the other diner from the chest up but is open from the chest level down so someon in the other booth could easili reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purs if they want to or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peekaboo with the diner on the other side  it pretti weird

so the waitress came over took our drink order with a minimum of small talk or overal friendli  we perus the menus  my husband chose a beef brisket sandwich  i want a tbone steak i had been crave one and i was look forward to it  we order our dinner and it worth mention that at no point did the waitress acknowledg that presenc of our daughter  she never ask us what she want to eat or if she need anyth to drink either appar she was invis  see as how there werent ani kid meal on the menu i just assum wed feed her from our own plate but interest the waitress just assum that too becaus she didnt even ask if shed be have a side order of someth as her meal  she just look right past her  if i sound piss it becaus i was  i dont need the waitress to pinch her cheek and make babi talk with her but to mere acknowledg the fact that there were three human be sit at the booth that night would have been cover in basic manner 101

so my steak was veri flavor and tender but bad undercook terribl fatti and a sick color gray  it didnt have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it  i order it medium rare but instead i got bloodi almost blue meat  and there was so much fat that i onli got about half meat the rest was all scrap fat and the bone  my side were nondescript  i think my mash potato were probabl decent i honest cant even rememb that how nondescript they were  the roll and bread basket that came with my food one littl roll and one littl cold biscuit were hard and tast store bought  and my hungri toddler didnt even want them  my husband beef brisket sandwich was a pathet dri out flavorless wast of good money  we didnt even bother with desserts

i had a margarita it was veri good but beguil strong for how petit the rock glass is that it was serv in  after i finish it the waitress came around and ask me if i want anoth and i declin but my husband a nondrink immedi pipe up and said yes shell have anoth and shot me a play look and rather than look to me so see if i realli want anoth 7 margarita or not she simpli walk away and had the bartend make me anoth one  wtf  so within a coupl of minut i had yet anoth veri veri strong margarita sit in front of me  now im no cheapskat but i dont like to wast money so i choke down that second margarita and it was the proverbi straw that broke the camel back  i may have finish it but it definit finish me  i spent the rest of the night stumbl and mumbl to myself about someon slip me a mickey  ive never ever had a margarita that strong and i am a veri well season drinker   what of earth did they put in them

so to sum it up i spent over 60 includ the tip for 2 small molotov cocktail disguis as margarita an undercook fatti tbone steak an ined dri beef brisket sandwich and a big serv of noth for my child  

never again

th two star are for the flavor and tender of the otherwis failur of a steak and the extrem valu for your money on the alcohol  that itit must be me or i just never order the right thing not sure everyon i know that has ever mention the duck tell me they like it yes i have been sever time over the year but a few day ago i was at our offic which is on 7th ave just south of thoma i was realli hungri and want someth to eat this in it self is kind of unusu as i can more than like wait until the end of the day befor i have to eat plus the fact i have enough fat on me to last a few month i would not be starv to death ani time soon if i miss a meal or three so i ask bruce you rememb bruce he is the guy i am alway ask thing when down at the offic i want someth deliv as i want to stay in the offic to get a contract readi for sign the onli place he could think of was the duck but he said he could go and get it much faster so i said ok and gave him my card and told him to get what he want and order me i think it is call the ducki or someth like that  man he was back much more quick than i had expect him to be so they must have been on the ball in make the food but the food as i alway find just nondescript no discern flavour just a mish mash of textur and bland so i can say i like the build the quick they have gotten my food out and the patio i guess the folk are also nice but do not rememb them so they were not not nice i just do not get the prais this place get i find much better food for less elsewher but hey it might just be me sinc i am of the minor on this subjecteat review of rokerij

i want to like this place it a great setup and well done environ the set is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eat some food

unfortun my first experi has left an impress that is less than stellar my girlfriend and i had been want to tri it out a few time we got a booth by the fireplac and settl in for a nice meal

th special are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for display special we are both vegetarian that will eat fish and were excit by the plethora of fish dish choic on the special board this tend to say that a place can do fish

our server was nice enough but when we ask for some recommend he stare at us blank and grab the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while this is a huge pet peev for me if a place is gonna charg 20 or more for an entre the staff better be train on the dish and be readi to give some recommend show some passion and knowledg and sell me the good stuff

w order the white bean bruschetta to start it was edibl but lack in flavor mayb some salt wouldnt have hurt but someth more than just bean and toast please

next was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor go on not impressed

fin we went with the sesam crust fish with a melon salsa this dish start off a disast and just got wors first of all the server bring it over hold it with a towel as we shift plate around to make room he start yelp a bit in pain not a great sign onc he get it set down we move to dig in but my love date brush her arm on the plate and come away with a pretti solid burn

thi is just plain stupid there is no need for a plate to be 200 degre cook the food and then bring it out dont cook it at my tabl on the plate

unfortun the fish was not edibl at all the melon salsa was horrid we sent it back and still got charged

rokerij i want to love you there are a lot of folk on yelp that love you but i have to say that for food you have not impress mesad i am forc to agre with lesli m who wrote on 410 this was one of my favorit place to visit to introduc newcom to treat famili and friend and for a time id visit onc everi two month or so my previous three visit have not gone so well ill relat my latest visit which took place just over a week ago a friend attempt to make reserv for two on a thursday he was told that due to a polici chang by  richardson a reserv for two on a thursday could no longer be taken as there was disappoint that their busi for tabl of 4 or more were suffer okay i can understand busi decis have to be made but cut your nose off to spite your face howev the woman that answer the phone let us know there should be no problem get a tabl i was seat short befor my friend arriv so i had a chanc to look over the menu to my surpris some chang have been made first a salad choic and theyr all veri typic veri yummi anyway a choic is no longer offer instead the hous salad is offer at 4 with the entre purchas next a statement is now print across the top of the menu let the patron know you order it you bought iti this realli necessari while the server and busboy were friend and help my water glass was never empti my 4 hous salad arriv about 90 second befor our entre did oh the accompani bread was hard as stone and arriv with my salad while an attent server should have brought it along just after our drink were serv as my dinner partner hadnt order a salad oh my friend hes typic a big fan of the steak rokerij and absolut love the crabhollandais sauc mixtur as normal he ask for more sauc on this visit we found 10 ad to the check for that request we found that unusu for rokerij thing have certain chang i was will to overlook these chang after all the economi is poor these day i excus myself to use the men room after all we did have chimay rokerij has never had a wide beer select i found the towel basket to be so pack with papertowel i couldnt get one out of the basket which is on a vaniti so small when you turn the water on the towel becom soak this explain the stain linen towel basket linerth stain were gray and green overal i feel that these thing add up to fail to pay attent to detail it a shame realli i realli hope the best for richardson and hope rokerij can return to it former selfwhen i was a kid i would eat a pile of plain noodl with butter on them while the rest of my famili mow down on real italian food i think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more like to end up on them than in them and tomato sauc hurt when it end up in your eye but in twentyodd year my palat has matur past the realm of bland noodl and into the realm of big girl flavor i think that whi i was so disappoint by giusepp 

i order the smoke salmon with asparagus pasta think heck yeah lox me up and throw away the key instead i got the toddler special in disguis a big pile of noodl drown in butter with flake of salmon and asparagus float throughout ewwi the noodl were fresh prepar sinc it was the weekend and were a doughi delight it too bad they were mar by such a crap combin i mean you cant even toss in some garlic onion or someth vagu resembl season failur failur failure

mi boyfriend pasta carbonara was a thing of beauti it is veri difficult to find real carbonara in the valley most place just toss togeth white sauc and bacon and call it a night veri few take the time to saut onion garlic and pancetta add steam hot pasta raw egg and parmesan chees and toss until it ooz togeth into drool induc blob of yum amaz good 

it just odd that such contradictori dish are on the same menu 

we also had the garlic bread becaus what better to add to a giant pile of carb than more bread it was passabl veri dri and crispi more like crouton and top with a delish garlicki spice infus oil four tini toastett for four buck though not the greatest deal 

i shall be back ill just stay far far away from the nood combo of question origin 

ps  to all my wino out there cork fee of 4 buckthis place seem to want to get rich off be featur on food network  there a big banner out front now and there are pictur all over the place of the owner im guess and guy  anyway this is whi i decid to tri the place at all so mayb it worked

mi friend order the chicken parmigiana sandwich and i went with the linguin with red clam sauc  it a veri tini place with plastic patio chair  we wait for about 20 min so we had time to check out the decor  

the price are crazi  they charg as much as a full italian restaur doe  ive never seen a diner drive thru or a dive that charg so much per plate  skim the menu id say the averag entre is about 12 appet is 8 desert is 5  

so by the time we got our food we were starv but we manag to drive home which was about 5 min away  they gave me a few piec of bread for my pasta which was veri good and veri surpris becaus bread is on the menu for like 5  the pasta was overcook and the sauc was waaay salti  the portion wasnt what i expect for the price i paid at a dive  the sandwich was a littl better but noth special  i work at a hospit and id say their chicken parmigian is better

al in all this wasnt the best experi  i say if they want to charg so much open an actual restaur  then mayb they can serv some liquor instead of just have pictur of wine bottl everywher and empti vodka bottl hold flower  it byob 5 corkag fee  im veri disappoint in food network  a cowork and i stop in at giusepp for lunch this week becaus we were visit a store in the same shop center and saw the sign hang out front about them be featur on a show on the food network  i did see the show and had been mean to stop so it seem like a perfect time

i expect to be blown away and was a littl disappoint  the salad was pretti good but noth spectacularwer talk your basic iceberg lettuc with tomato and a veri nice italian dress  i had a chicken dish with fettucini which while there was a lot of it was bland and oili and the chicken was dri and way overcooked

im from chicago as it seem like most phoenician are and have experienc excel italian so know there has to be someth better in the valley  mayb their sandwich are better or mayb i just order one of their eh dish or mayb the chef cook was have an off day  so in my opinion giusepp is bare averag food and way over price  skip it unless your starv and noth els is openpricey due to high esplanad rent great stop befor or after your amc choos pastri not baguett 

wow 65 for two sandwich with side salad bottl of lemonad sparkl water and dessert  
baguett not authent 
pasta salad bland
but it all about the bread for a proper sandwich mixt avec cruditi and this bread was not it 
great cafe feel and french owner lend authenticity
worth it for the the pastri 

still on a quest for the proper french baguetti stop in here for lunch one day last week  i had been want to check it out for a while sinc it is just down the street from my offic  the review say it was expens kept me away but now after see the menu i dont think it so bad compar to other place in the area  you realli cant get a lunch for less than 10 anywher in old town scottsdal unless you do fast food or the food court in the mall  i thought the place was decor super cute and with a nice relax atmospher and the staff was veri friendly

but the food was just kind of averag  i had a 12 panini and soup and they both pretti much tast like someth i could make at home  i also took home a coupl of pastri now those are way overpr i agre that also were not too impress  i will definit give them anoth tri just sinc they are so close  hope some of their other menu item will be better  they did have great smell cappuccino so i may tri to sneak out some time for a midmorn coffe and croissant

i think this is a cute littl french cafe to stop by for a quick lunch if you are in the area but i would definit agre with suzann s that it is not a destin restaur at all  there are a lot better option nearbiive been to this locat a few time now and i guess it time for me to write a review of this place  honest of all the groceri store big and small here in the valley trader joe is probabl my least favorit  over the year ive tri to like themtrust me ive tri i just cant get into the trader joe scene

it not one particular thing that turn me off about trader joe but mayb it a varieti of small thing that irk me for starter i find thier food select odd  most prepackag stuff with no deli meat counter  and veri littl name brand stuff  i know i know i dont need to buy everi singl thing name brand but there are some thing name brand that i prefer over other  plus when i buy lunch meat i want to go to a deli counter and get it which they do not have  just prepackag meat n cheeses

i tend to buy most sandwich here dure lunch hour  their fair price and right there  the first few time i went here i was get a tuna sandwich on whitebread  i like it and start buy it on a regular basi  then they stop make it  whi  i dunno but i havent seen it in like 3 week  just when i start like someth it vanish  now all they have are tuna wrap but they arent as good as the sandwiches

a for groceri shop on a week basi i will probabl never be a regular here  the reason i frequent this trader joe is becaus it a close to my offic b there a decent sandwhich select readili avail and c thier staff is alway friend and helpthis was a great novel thing back in the day

wil haunt this msg pit till it die dayi was excit to tri this place and when i saw the travelzoo deal i jump on it i was tri to think of the best way to describ their food and it remind me of convent center food  i think they have cater to too mani wed and have lost the art of cook qualiti meals

thi is also one of those place where you get the feel that it cool to pay more for less we were seat insid after request a patio seat and we brought the averag age down about 30 year it was hot and stuffi and the seat were so uncomfort i had to take some advil when i got home had the worst french onion soup ive ever seen eaten not sure how you mess that up and the salmon was too salti even for me  im would not consid myself a food snob but i have eaten plenti of good food and this place just doesnt make the cut  the onli plus side to our dinner was be abl to walk around the mansion and see the decor afterward  if we had actual been abl to sit on the patio im sure the view would have been nice

there noth new about their new american menu and underwhelm is the most posit spin i can place on the entir experi 

it a veri limit menu with 15 dollar sandwich and salad or 2530 dollar cut of meat  way to cater to the vegetarian out there with a veggi burger or an overpr entre of season veget do restaur have ani idea how bore it is to eat a veggi burger everi time you go out get a littl creativ for christsak it not like your lack possibl ingredi combinations

i had the ahi tuna burger which was ground down to a meali consist and cook until bone dri  it was then garnish with grodi unimagin top like pickl and iceburg lettuc top it off with a cloy sweet remoulad that did noth to moisten the sandwich and youv got a bone dri tonsil scraper the roast chicken was on the greasi side but well season the couscous it came with was a misstep though someon threw a ton of whole mint leav into it that made it ined instead of fresh which im sure was the intent the spinach dip was teensi tini for the price and whi the heck is it serv with can crappi salsa and sour cream on the side weird

th fri were the one save grace skin on super slim shoestr cut with the perfect amount of salt but ive had fri and batter bull ball and theyv tast good fri anyth and itll improv the edibl 

servic was near nonexist although as a whole the etiquett was top notch when it was present but it was a complet disconnect when compar to the cruddi food be slung your serv a french dip sandwich not some wild top chef creation dial back on the smug

i dont ever see a need to return to a place that serv tradit noth new about it american food i can make better in my own home i expect more from profession chef than chicken sandwich and steaks

ok  so this review is base sole on my experi at the wine barloung area and not the actual restaur  i was meet a group of friend here for a cozi cocktail befor we all took off to our various locat of origin for the holiday  on a tuesday night at 7 the loung area was pack  i couldnt believ it  i arriv with my husband and there was onli one other person from our parti at the bar  so i scout the place out and swoop in like a hawk when i saw a parti vacat a nice plush couch in the back corner  
 
the decor is veri cozi  wood fireplac go low light oak tabl plush couch beauti patio  veri spanish villa  but i guess that this place use to be a spanishvilla influenc privat estat so no surpris there 
 
so after be seat we wait for a server  and wait  we notic onli one server in the entir loung and peopl were liter line up to talk to her either to get her attent or to simpli put in order  it turn out she was the onli server for the whole loung  that not her fault but that is definit some poor manag right there 
 
we order some food off the loung menu and some drink and proceed to enjoy ourselv with our friend over the cours of the next 3 hour  i start with the pinot grigio and my husband had the 007 martini or the jame bond martini  someth like that  both were good  for food we select the calamari in aioli the charcuteri plate and the tenderloin burger  the calamari was interest to say the least  the aioli was veri wateri and almost mayoy kind of like cole slaw  um ok  the tenderloin burger was veri plain  the boursin chees was creativ but it didnt do much to help  the applewood smoke bacon could best be describ as stale  it was extrem brittl almost hurt to bite into  it wasnt even that it was crispi becaus even when bacon is proper prepar crispi it still a littl chewi 
 
the charcuteri plate never came
 
over the 3 hour the crowd die down and we were abl to enjoy a littl more relax atmospher  but the servic never improv  rare did the server return to our tabl to check on us  one of our friend order a tenderloin burger much later in the night and it took almost 45 minut to get to him  after our first drink i order the sauvingon blanc and my husband the russian valley pinot noir  the sb tast like pickl juic and my husband exclaim that it was potenti the worst pn he had ever had    
 
at the end of the night we got the check  117  for a mediocr burger strang prepar calamari a cocktail a beer and 4 glass of wine between my husband and i two of which were terrible
 
not worth it
 
wors out of curios i took a look at the regular restaur menu  3 entre with mushroom i hate mushroom 1 with duck to which im allerg and 2 were seafood base on the calamari i wouldnt go for the seafood  
 
so there is absolut noth here i would eat  no reason to return whatsoevi am just go to leav at this this is phoenix peopl dont know better

when our server introduc us by say the chef was on the iron chef program  i knew right then we were go to have a less then adequ meal

when there was a plethora of shellfish and no game on the menu i knew we were go to have a less then adequ meal this is arizona in the winter yall escargot  realli in arizona

though menu item usual have spare descript i am use to eleg present with mani compon a la iruna especi all the hype around tcook  ala my salad was mix green and slice pear  yes mix green and slice pear  made me giggl then i rememb this was phoenix

so order the duck breast  i was think this will be okay  sigh  whi was my duck breast rubberi i am guess after they sear the breast the chefcook slice it too fast neglect to wait the minut for the meat to rest  forc my duck breast to be inedible

then i look around the room gasp white hair old peopl abound  these folk are from phoenix  ha they are have a grand ol time  ok i wont dog them but how about the mousi hair frumpi chick next to us with the bead top

dessert  we may have had dessert  i think we did  it was that memorable

servic was love  our server was proper  that nice  but i will trade bad servic for excel food ani day of the week

so yea  this is not the place for good foodi would agre that the food and pastri here are abov averag but when i walk into a small crowd noisi place and dont know where to go for a simpl beverag and no employe seem to notic my perplex or to care i come away feel the place is pretenti snobbi confus and out of my leagu which is too bad becaus it right in my neighborhood i sens that if your a regular here then probabl you feel welcom and the employe chat you up all time but not all of us can afford to be regular here this is at least the third time that la grand orang uppiti ambienc has annoy me so i dont feel guilti about the poor reviewit way too loud in here i prefer the central ave locateverybodi rave about this place so i final went with a friend last week  i wish i hadnt heard so mani good thing prior to go becaus i was sever disapoint  
servic was aw  we came at 4 pm so we could get in abotu 3 glass of wine befor the 5 wine end  wrong  it took 30 minut each time we order a glass of wine and i mean 30 minut from the time we order it  when we went to order the 2nd glass of wine it was 2 minut after 5 and luckili sinc we complain we still got it for the 5 price  the bruschetta also took an excess amount of time to come and 2 of the cut piec had fell of somewher so we got jip  let me say i onc was a server for mani year  this place was not that busi and definet not so busi that it take 30 minut to get a glass of wine

food was ok  i didnt think the bruschetta was anyth special like all my friend made it seem  i like the salmon pesto one but that about it

i know this review sound mean and sinc i have heard such great thing i am will to give this place anoth tri  i will order a panini and hope get quicker servic  if thing are better i will be happi to revis my review if not i will put postino in my overr categorii usual get annoy when i see peopl review a thai restaur and give lower star becaus neither the owner nor custom nor server nor anyon is thai youv seen these review caus in my head if the food and servic are good whi should i give a shit who is serv it to me the whole debat about authent is one i find annoy on sever levels

 so first no i am not give them two star caus the guy who serv us was the blondest gringo with passabl though arrog spanish with a haircut i dont know the name for but would describ as a mini bowl cutposs a shelf cut his servic was shitti which definit has someth to do with the low star and it certain doesnt help that i had to listen to him ask the waiter in spanish which he assum i didnt speak mayb 7 time if the cheesi convert out front was our but then i had to listen to him talk about convert with anoth tabl for ten minut that may have someth to do with the star takeway

i actual could have heard the guitarist sing guantanemera 8 more time than listen to the waiterposs owner talk about car to the neighbor tabl that is a big statement for me as my nippl usual invert for minimum 48 hour everi time guantanemera is play anywher within a 17 mile radius

th most obvious reason for the 2 star rate is the food it suck shit it did not tast that it was fresh cook in ani way there was a film over teh meatbal sauc that had to be broken sever time for the moat of semiwarm liquid to emerg everythin was sever underwhelm and lack flavor
specif these item in addit to tini meatbal in a bowl of lukewarm sauc that the mother bless her was a fan of would be

empanadita trio we had the beefbland

som kind of black bean ball the onli reason this place didnt get one star is that the avocado dip for said bbball was tasti this has to do with my undi love for the avocado rather than their particular dip

spanish tortilla the worst i think ive ever had and i spent 5 year as a poor tortilla eater in spain and argentina in  between english teachin gig when they came as free tapas

th best thing here was probabl the bread they brought it warm  our other favorit was some kind of chees spinach thing that i would put more in the greek famili wasnt bad
al in all this place was mas o meno mierdaoh no oh no oh no  the declin of one of my favorit restaur is upon us which make me veri sad this might be a bit long as i normal hold havana café veri near and dear to my heart 

over the last 4 year i have been to each of the three locat north valley central and chandler  which has sinc close and love each consist good food drink and servic the past few time i have visit ive start to see the sign of a declin in qualiti but last night realli seal the deal 

the mojito  these are what drive me to the restaur i have long said that the mojito at havana café are my veri favorit libat that have ever cross my lip alway veri fresh not too sweet lot of mint and perfect strong last night they tast like they came from a mix i do have to say that they were quit strong so that was nice as i do enjoy a bit of a buzz but that was about the onli redeem qualiti a microscop amount of mint syrupi tast and whi on god green earth were they pink they were never pink befor 

the food  i had my usual the paradis pull pork it was tasti as alway they have definit mess with the portion though you use to get an equal amount of pork to the rice and bean mixtur that be said you still get a consider amount of food but for 20 it stung a bit to be given the shaft on my tasti shred swine 

mi honey had the gamba y pollo which we realli enjoy it was quit tasti yummi sauc that compliment the shrimp quit well

th servic  realli pretti bad the man who took care of us and the onli one who was there serv was not outright rude but i felt like we were interrupt the bookkeep that he was do at the tabl in the corner by come in to eat we were not the onli peopl there when my man ask him whether he like the mojito or the caipirinha better he made sort of a big deal of say that in the larg amount of year he has work there he has never tri either as they just dont appeal to him an odd answer for sure but i guess honest he gave both of us a realli crappi vibe while we were there he actual threw someth at the busboy 

i have experienc this man befor  and onc saw him repeat be extrem rude to a guest on the patio over the entir cours of my dinner i dont know the whole stori but it was veri offput that experi almost had me say i was not go to come back to this locat but what can i say it alway been a fav of mine 

i realli hope this was a fluke as i would hate to see such a previous amaz restaur take this bad of a nose dive 

i almost feel like ive lost a best friend 

tldr  great food definit overpr especi on account of the shrink portion shitti servic poor mojito which previous would knock my sock offwe chose this place for breakfast this morn becaus of the wonder review on yelp  i was certain it was go to be one of my new favorit place 

we enter into a bright paint orang restaur and stood at the hostess stand for a few minut wait for the hostess to finish flirt with the server and notic us  she clear didnt want to be there and could care less where we sat so opt for the tabl in the window  

we sat and wait and wait and wait  tabl that were sat after us alreadi had their drink and they were not busi  final i tri to get the attent of the hostess who was stand half asleep at the hostess stand mouth open wide eye half close  a few minut later we final had a server

our server was not veri friend  i dont even think she said good morn  we order  tabl sat after us alreadi got their food and we final got our drink  she bought out 2 cup of coffe but i did not order coffe so i made her take that back 

our food final arriv  we order french toast which came with strawberri banana and a cinnamon sauc egg benedict with crab cake and two order of countri potato 

breakfast was pretti good  i enjoy my crab cake and the cinnamon sauc on the french toast was a nice ad touch  the potato were not good they had way too much pepper on them i couldnt even eat them  gari ate a few of his after he drown them in ketchup

w never saw our server again  we got a water refil after we finish our meal  and the wait began  we wait and wait and wait for our check  tabl that were sat when we finish eat had alreadi finish their food  we never saw our waitress i guess we were her onli tabl if not i felt bad for her other tabl as well 

final some guy brought us our check and tri to drop it off and run i said wait and gave him my card and said if i dont give this to you now it may be 20 more minut befor we see someon again

becaus i didnt look at the bill first when he brought it back i didnt notic until after i paid that they charg me 1205 for the egg benedict when their menu actual said 1050  i didnt say anyth  i just left a sad tip

w were there for over an hour they had lot of empti tabl and we onli saw our server once

gari and i alway over tip becaus he and his famili own restaur in the valley for 35 year  he has spent a lot of time be a chef and serv tabl  we know that when food come out wrong it probabl not the server fault and thing happen so we still tip well  today i felt like we were invis and i have no idea where our server disappear to for the hour  

we drove by over easi la grand orang and ihop to tri this place  we probabl will not be back unless we decid to give it a second tri on jazz night i do love jazzafter so may 4 and 5 star review i decid to give taylor anoth chanc after my first visit think perhap i just had a bad experi and this place realli is as great as everyon rave so now on to my second dine adventur and i am still not impress 
the place is cute it has a great charm and ambianc realli a perfect set for a causal breakfast or lunch the food is decent but noth except and extrem overpr my first time i had the huevo ranchero and they realli should have been call huevo gringo the dish consist of bean fold into a wheat tortilla with a fri egg and veri bland tomatillo sauc what side do you get for 925  chipsneed more than chip i ad a side of potato 3  i split this dish and was charg 2 without even be ask bring the total dish to 1425 get real for breakfast   i compar this dish to harlow huevo ranchero there is 795 and come with potato and bean and tortillas
mi second visit i order the creat your own omelet for 1075 this seem high for an omelet but i went with it it was pretti good but again the side toast or a bagel order the potato 3 and anoth split plate charg 2 without be ask let me rant on this one for a moment they charg me 2 to cut my omlette in half the bagel alreadi come slice lame bring it on one plate and i can cut it myselfit is not like we got doubl portion veri annoy so now the omelet is 1595 ridicul add an oj 5 buck when most place have 3 mimosa on sunday i found pay 5 for an oj ridicul so in all taylor food is decent but with so mani good and lower price option in the nearbi area i dont seem myself go backi have to agre with patti b that this locat pretti much suck  the servic is just ok  they are far from friend  ive been in  a coupl of time to pick up food and i have yet to be impress  i want to give them anoth chanc tonight and i should not have bother  the food is not so good  id rather go to pita jungl or thai llana ani day  the spring roll are greasi and room temperatur and the tofu is pretti nasti  i had some kind of udon noodl dish and threw most of it in the garbag  use your free entre coupon to save  one night but that about it i will not be return to this pei wei ani time soonoverpr entre underwhelm food my wife and i made a trip to scottsdal to enjoy some warm weather and down time this spring we want a good meal for our last night and were encourag to read some of the review of this place own by italian homemad pasta  sound right up our alley unfortun we were signific disappoint we both had pasta special i had the parpadell w lamb ragu and she had the squid ink pasta w half a lobster clam and mussel im not one to complain about price but i do have a problem with place charg big price onli to sever miss the mark on flavor the parpadell and squid ink pasta were 40 and 50 respect the parpadell is a dish that even the swankiest restaur in nyc charg 20 at most for the squid ink claim to have 12 of a whole lobster but we could onli find a few bit of overcook tail in it skimp on the lobster left a terribl impress with me and led me to believ that theyr pull a fast one on us this feel was further valid after the waiter came by to inform us that he ask the chef to remov the meat from the shell so the ladi wouldnt have to get her hand dirti when the dish came we were shock when we didnt find an ounc of claw meat in the dish 

final but most import the flavor the parpadell was decent but the fresh homemad pasta was way too thick about twice the thick that ive ever eaten in even the crappiest of place the thick of the pasta coupl with the fact that it did not seem like they ever finish the noodl in the sauc left both dish veri unbalanc heavi on the pasta  even though they had a heavi hand approach to the sauce

asid from the pasta we had the cheesecak and gelato  both of which were more disappoint than the pasta 

the cherri on the top the cheesi loung sing perform at dinner realli am i in a vega loung save the money and your palett im sure there are other excel place in scottsdal  i was onli hope marcellino was one of them unfortun it wasnt and the onli folk benefit are the owner that should be asham of the dish theyr put out therethe food here give a whole new mean to the word bland  that make this an ok place becaus most anybodi could eat what they serv without ani complaint  it is a good place to take a famili or for a big eater  you get food and lot of it  it kind of make me think of pig when you see them at a feed trough  what they get may not be good but they walk away full happi piggi  carlo obrien send out lot of happi oinkers

did you pick up on the subtl hint that this may not be the place for those who are look for someth special when they want to have mexican food  i hope lol

i debat on two or three star  i wouldnt go back there myselftwo star  if i had a famili to feed or peopl from out of town who dont need to be impressedthre star  id rather be posit than negat so they get threeyep still sucks

went their recent for a friend birthday didnt want to but it was for one of my oldest friend and i didnt want to disappoint her 

i onli order drink and had some chip and salsa drink were good but the chip and salsa werent great the server seem annoy i wasnt order food but do you blame me with my past experi i had a tast of my friend chees enchilada and vegan black bean the staff is so proud of not impressed

sorri but i wouldnt trust ani mexican restaur in the phoenix area that has less than 4 star there are mani better choicdine on friday 22213 my wife and i recent move to the phoenix area from chicago and i realli had no idea about where to dine it was my wife birthday and i want to dine at least at a 4 star restaur so i came to yelp for advice

our reserv was 815pm and we arriv at 755pm we were invit to sit in the loung area which we did and i expect to do so sinc we were so earli  we sat in the loung for about 10 min and were not approach by a server in fact i thought there were no server sinc i saw none on the floor so i went to the bar and order myself just like i would at a chicago neighborhood bar irk1drink were good and strong but realli pricey 26 for 2 drinks

around 830pm we went back to the hostess desk as no one came to get us for our reserv yet they said they would find us in the loung we were told our tabl still wasnt readi and to wait by the fireplac i was a littl peev now and iwould have expect to wait if i was late but we were suffici on time i thought 

we were seat after wait anoth 5 min or so 845pm30 min lateirk2 the wait staff i thought were pretti good overal they did a lot of tabl hop ie cover each other tabl so diner were well taken care of yet not too pushi or chatty

w both order the lobster bisqu soup i order the halibut and my wife order the scallop bread was not brought to the tabl until after we order dinner which was 10 min after we were seat irk 3 the sourdough bread was excel the focaccia bread was kind of bland and dri there were 3 dip side offer with the bread which were veri good 

lobster bisqu was quit delici they put this hydropon infus basil season on top of the soup that was veri good i thought the soup was a littl overcook sit in the pot too long tast but still good my dinner arriv hot and the halibut was bland and littl overcook panfri i ask for 2 more piec of the sourdough bread to eat with my dinner and we were told they were out of sourdough irk4 friday night dinner servic and out of bread realli my wife scallop were cool as well as her veget side on the plate irk 5the waiter didnt check on us until 10 min after the dinner was serv irk6 so it wasnt feasibl to send it back to get reheat the waiter offer us comp desert for the troubl at least

th last irk 7 was that we ask for a bag to put our leftov take home box in 3 total box the waiter said they were out of bag he check twice and the 3rd time brought us a home depot bag i ask if he went to his car to get it how difficult would it have been for the restaur manag to go down to the gift shop and grab a coupl of dozen bag 

mayb my expect are too high sinc im from chicago but when  a restaur is rate 5 star by all of you yelper i expect a littl better servic when drop a coupl of hundr buck other than the view and the ambianc i wouldnt recommend this restaurmcdonald is mcdonald my beef with this place is they stop sell ice and i prefer not to have to drive all over town in search of ice while wear pajama 

see httpwwwyelpcombizmcdonaldsrestaurantsphoenix44hridjpfxqubzmuboiifnmwp7gick

it was one of those even when you toss dinner option back and forth but noth realli stick  

in retrospect we should have stay home  even in the barren foodless space that is my kitchen i could have done better  howev lure by an ad boast a world famous gyro for the bargain price of 5 off we went

upon arriv we were quick greet by a man i assum is the owner shown to a tabl and given menus  a few minut later he came back to tell us he would send someon over to take our order  great  strang the waitress that arriv to ask us what we would like to drink couldntwouldnt take our food order as someon els was actual our waiter  huh  well we final were abl to order from our real waiter who was veri nice by the way and the onli reason for 2 star vs 1 and our world famous gyro arriv short  

uh no  what i found on my plate was a pile of sauc wrap in paper  the entir gyro was drown in tzatziki  now i happen to realli like tzatziki but but not to the point that i cannot even identifi what i am suppos to be eat  i scrape off as much as i could but then onli tast over salti meat soggi lettuc and yes sauc  after a few bite i wave the white flag of surrend  i just couldnt do it

guess you get what you pay forif your a picki sushi eater dont wast your time here it may be cheap but the servic and qualiti reflect that

somehow i manag to spend about 25 on my dinner there tonight even with happi hour price  i know it not so bad for sushi but the servic was extrem off and the sushi was just meh

id been befor and im sure ill go again just with the expect in check next time

i share an order of yellowtail sashimi an i also had a seawe salad it was violet in color  have you ever seen that befor a scallop handrol generous in serv size but way too creami for my like and an order of ikura  

we sat in the bar area it was fine for a casual dinner with friend but noth fanci at all  there are much better sushi place to choos from  even in azlim chines boofay is a throwback china boofay  if you want seafood and spring roll and veget and no msg youd better head elsewher  if you rememb go to a china boofay in 1979 back when nobodi knew or care that chines peopl never eat this stuff and you love the kitschi decor and salti fri food then lim is your place  ill bet that the recip and decor are the same as theyv been for the last 30 years

youv got your requisit fri rice lo mein beefbroccoli sesam chicken sweetsour pork egg foo young eggrol fri chicken and mayb a coupl of other item beyond that  everyth was cook not so bad as far as the consist on the crispygreasi spectrum but had so much msg that my mouth liter had a buzz feel when i left  not a tast a feel left over from the monosodium glutam infus cuisin  blech

th discard pile was actual tini for the sesam chicken but instead of honey it was flavor with syrupcheapass imitaion mapl corn syrup  still i must admit it was lean chunk of white meat chicken and was my favorit if i had to pick a poison
ss pork look lean with larg chunk of nonfatti meat but the insid were a littl grist and each bite in had about 20 come back out onto the discard pile  seem like they tri to keep it lean though

in the entir boofay tabl there was hard ani color from veggi  all i found was some icebertg lettuc and coleslaw in the cold section plus brocolli in the beefbroc carrot and onion in the ss and some white cabbag and a few onion piec in the lo mein  that about it  oh the egg roll had cabbag insid too and are the old school thick skin bubbl deep fri and mushi not the spring roll thin skin crispi kind

lim had some decent flavor and i creat a small discard pile so could be a 3star boofay by get rid of the msg use honey instead of syrup on the chicken and ad a bunch more veggi into the mix

625 lunch 150 more for a soda was not worth it no matter how much volum you shove in

stil buzz from the weird msg high  no sir i dont like itthis is definit not my favorit place for breakfast  i hate the wick cram layout of this place and the decor is just confus  i dont get the diamondpl on the wall and i definit dont understand the down home countri kitschi decor up on shelv  whatev it about the food right

i order a bacon and chees omelet with hashbrown and i was a littl less than impress  the omelet was pretti crispi on the edg and that is onli appropri when i order fri egg  the bacon was okay but too overdon  there wasnt enough chees and the chees that was there was just blah  the hashbrown just tast like potato  they need a ton of salt for me to eat them  i thought the portion while enough for me were a bit small for the price  pretti much everywher els i can get a heap plate of breakfast food for under 7 buck  

ive had better  that realli all there is  the servic was nice enough but i just dont realli care for this place  i realli felt like i was eat in some podunk town with all the strang charact dine here  at least it didnt make me sicknever have gotten a good deal with these guy which is sad i like their thin crust pizza with all the meat but this one seem to be way overpr so when that happen i search elsewher forget they screw me end up over in their park lot and see their sign my stomach over ride my brain and say thin crust and i place an order give them anoth chanc nope screw again shame on me as i put my wallet in my pocket and now review this place as i wait first as a warn for you my friend but most as a remind for myself that im an idiot for tri them againwhi all the hype i am still ponder whi peopl rave about this place after have lunch there last week the locat is not in the best part of town the dine area is pretti dirti see attach pictur and the servic sucked

w order a beef chimichanga which they left in the fryer too long so it came out almost burnt and it was tini like 4 bite and your done tiny
a bean and chees burrito good but noth spectacular and a chorizo tostada i will say the chorizo was excel and i am glad becaus i had to fight for it 

the place was pack when we arriv so it took us about 40 minut to order and get our food they call out number for you to pick up your order so there is this constant drone of number call and the speaker was realli loud it was pretti annoy 


to pick up your food you give them your receipt with your number on it they gave me a bean tostada instead of a chorizo and when i took it back the guy ask me for my number to prove i order it this was the same guy i gave the ticket to when i pick it up origin i told him this and he sigh heavili and start pick though all the receipt in the stack a few minut later he locat it roll his eye and hand me a new tostada

th food was averag and the servic sub par i wont be return and there are panderia on everi corner so be abl to buy home made tortilla realli didnt impress me that muchit ok  

i hate to alway be bitch about mexican food in the valley but what can you do  it a disgrac  the fact that this place appear to be some kind of holi grail of mexican food here in phoenix just seem to emphas that point

let deal with the food first  this isnt realli mexican food it texmex food  that mean youv got your choic of taco burrito tostada enchilada chimichanga etc  

we tri the oaxaca burro massiv air quot around the oaxaca part of the name which was just fine but veri veri small  i mean serious it bean chees potato and a bit of chorizo  were not talk ahi tuna here  whi not give a normal size portion

w tri the menudo which was delici but again a miniscul portion and they cant even be bother to give you a plastic bowl so you have to eat it out of the styrofoam to go contain  i mean for fs sake they give me a plastic bowl at my favorit taco truck  

still hungri we order a combin plate which was the same sort of texmex crap that you can get pretti much anywher in town  not so great

it was all fine for what it is i guess but noth that i would particular go out of my way for with the except of the homemad flour tortilla which were awesom  i even bought some to go  and that about it for the food

now as to the restaur itself it actual pretti disgust to the point where one has to conclud that they are just show contempt for the custom  the place is filthi  the bathroom in particular are vile as toni bourdain say i may not be abl to look in the kitchen but i can check out the bathroom and that let me know how much they care about the restaur uh exact   and the answer in carolina would seem to be not veri much  the sur and uninterest staff add to that special ambianc 

we eat in lot of small ethnic restaur and just becaus a place is in the hood doesnt mean it has to be gross  our favorit salvadorean restaur is in the hood but it also hospit clean which make me pretti confid that the kitchen is also clean 

final the neighborhood  lol  to describ this street as in the hood is an insult to hood everywher  this street is one of the most blight street ive ever been on anywher  im actual think of go back there today to do some documentari photo to send to my friend in cambodia whose vision of america are most deriv from csi miami  serious it appal  the main thing i was think about drive away from there is that the phoenix citi govern need some kind of feder intervention

so would i eat there again  yeah probabl if i was in the neighborhood  would i go out of my way to drive there  no wayi went to this airport fooderi with thought of get a great oaxacan meal at sky harbor airport but that was a fantasi not sure whi i ever thought that mayb it was just the oaxaca name

thi is burrito to go i order a machuca oaxaca burrito machuca be shred beef mix with onion and chili 

the burrito was surpris small i agre with eli first review it was not that tasti and it was real wateri or wet i went through 10 napkin becaus everytim i squeez the burrito by take a bit a puddl appear below the burrito it got to be irrit as i didnt want greasi stain on my cloth so i was tri real hard to wrap up this burrito so it wouldnt leak from the bottom 

it still leak after everi bite a littl puddl i would wipe up with yet anoth napkin 

the chili sauc was spici and was perhap the best thing about the food 

machuca burrito and drink total 853

i hate to admit it but it made me crave for chipotlthis is actual the first time i have ever been to a waffl hous my husband cousin talk about go here all the time so i had to check it out

our server was friend and she even was abl to incorpor the phrase  sausag fest  into our brief convers in other instanc this would have annoy me becaus of how inappropri it was in this set but while stare at her huge pregnant belli i could do noth but laugh

th food was not good the sausag gravi was way too salti egg were way undercook waffl were averag coffe was alright  serv in a lipstick stain mug the first go around  sausag and bacon were below averag hash brown were limp mushi and flavorless

i would onli return to a waffl hous if this was my onli optioni dont understand how this rate so high
 as other review have said this is not good sushi it edibl thus the 2 star rate but it not great i have been to this restaur 3 time to make sure i wasnt miss anyth and each time ive been onli mild satisfi they do not serv real crab their roll fall apart and the servic is not that great mayb im go at the wrong time i have been there dure lunch time each time ive gone and have not been impress at all on the 3rd tri my friend and i decid that we would not be return ani morewhat i was think on the way to los taquitos

i hate that guy fieri  what a jerk  first of all he pronounc his last name all italian and i am 100 certain that he pronounc it like a full on american all his life until he made it on food network  then he get to drive around and tast greasi food all day  plus he look high as a kite sometim on air which probabl make the food even better  anywher from 14 reason to be jealousannoy with the guy depend on who you are

also
i wish god would smite beyonc  her song are the most annoy song ive ever heard  if there were a way for her to get smack into perman silenc id be all for it

and
i cant wait to eat at this place  street taco sound delish  where is it  waitthi look like a residenti neighborhood  where the hell am i

ultim i find the place and go in  there some floozi outsid with a huge rackon pertin becaus she end up be an employe  well i guess it isnt realli pertin then either

anyway im want to like this place  i long to be abl to say that i went to a place today and ate food that tast like pure happi  i want to give this place five star and brag right and left that this is the place to be

but i dont  the servic was goodth girl was nice bc of an earlier review i was expect the worst and she told me the street taco were the way to go  i got the three taco one chicken one carnita one steak asada  plus rice and bean  on corn tortilla  and i got a sexylook bottl of coke

when the food came out i was devast  where my three taco should have been i had three walniuts excus for taco  where my bean cover in mexican chees should have been i got bean cover in an afterthought of some white chees which isnt what i want  sue me  where my rice should have been there was rice  1 for 3

the street taco all tast ostens the same  that punk guy fieri on diner drivein and dive on food network made it sound like id wet myself with glee upon eat the carnita and the ladi make the batch act like theyd be good enough to keep part of the recip a secret  they arent  that recip should be open sourc for sure so that mayb someon can come along and improv it  i certain could

anywaymayb it was becaus he was high as a fing kite but the food did not tast like magic it tast like hot sauc  and i am all for hot sauceil bitchslap a habanero or two no problem  but the issu is that whatev i ate it tast like onli the hot sauc  i ad green saucestil the same flavor  i want to be wow but instead i thought meh  ive experienc better  which is whi you see two star here

in fact i dont blame los taquito for do what they do  whatev is fine by me  but now i kinda wanna slewfoot guy fieri just that littl bit more for tell me that this place was so good  if your gonna tell the world what delici dont smoke out first becaus ive been there and eaten a piec of my cat litter and it tast pretti decent to me at the time  hard a reliabl indic of a culinari masterpiece

a coupl of disclaim i dont hate guy i have no idea if he smoke out im not judg him or you stoner  but i am judg that veri averag set of tacoi love hooters
no no not the restaurantit realli not the best dine experi from a good food perspect 
mr hooter found his establish hooter on the premis that a few chicken lose their wing so that we can happili dine on them and wash them down with beer is a good thing
it probabl is a good thing chicken dont realli need their wingseven the free rang clucker cant fli thing are just not particular well execut at hooter 
mayb it the boob who bought the place from mr hooter that arent live up to expectations
stil the patron were at hooter in forc yesterday afternoon
what keep them come in droves
ther must be someth that keep the client erstwhil diner come incould it be the charit caus i surmis that it someth about save owl that mr hooter support i understand that hooter is all about support
mayb it the extraordinarili loud yet incomprehens music come from the missynchron speaker dot the ceil of hooter i did notic that server all of whom seem to be young ladi in the full bloom of young ladyhood all seem to kind of groov to the music so they must like it
mayb it the comfort bosom of hooter sport bar décor funni sign rack and rack of sport memorabilia poster etc on the wall that the hooter client base yearn for nice artwork
hard to say i did notic that most of the diner were male mid 30s to 60s and just sort of stare glassi eye at the server not the food that may help explain things
th beauti carin call out of the blue and ask me out for lunch today
what a nice surpris for me
it was a perfect day for lunch becaus i was readi to get out of the offic for a while and see my girl
sh suggest hooter yeah that rightit wasnt me  we hadnt been to one for year so we gave it a tri 
she had a cobb salad with chicken breast and i had a chicken breast sandwich with a side of fri pickl i have a norwegian heritagew never saw a veget or fruit that we didnt want to fri boil bake or distill
it funni that we both order someth with breastsmust have been in the air
it wasnt horribl but it wasnt realli goodmediocr pedestrian ordinari are word that come to mind 
even the pickl which i had been want for a while
howev inexpens is not a word that come to mind36 for salad sandwich pickl and ice tea
i think we must be pay for ambianc 
i love hooters
no not the restaurmeh the onli reason i even step foot into rock bottom is becaus i had a lunch meet and it was at the suggest of my dine companion i use to go to rock bottom in atlanta everi now and then and it was ok especi if you go for beer  happi hour  i go to be blunt here right now though  this place sucks

luckili i enjoy the compani of those that i dine with otherwis it wouldv been a miser experi  thank for that miranda and ken if you happen to read this  

i had their cobb salad and it was pretti averag although the turkey in it was nasti  our waitress was slow as hell  the atmospher keep in mind we were there for lunch was noth special  rock bottom is the reason that im not big on chain  i dont think ill be return  even if im stuck at desert ridg there are plenti of other dine option that are far superior to rock bottom cpk yardhous rubio and more

sorri rb  had to do itmeh ive experienc betterso i love happi hour beyond explan you can imagin my excit to find out that happi hour is from 7 to close 

needless to say we order a lot too much but in my defenseit was like impuls shop  impuls dine 

anyway 

i order a bloodi mari to get my tummi prepar for the onslaught of food that it was about to receiv also the artichok dip slider and taco 

clock tick 
excit fade 
tummi growl 
irrit grow 

final the bloodi mari arriv or should i say tomato juic no celeri salt hot sauc worcestershir sauc anyth except for a whole fuck celeri tree that was engulf the glass 

boo hiss 

the rest i shall summar 
artichok dip  larg jar of mayo again no flavor 
taco  soak in sauc aka mayocouldnt tast much besid that 
slider  ok just ok meat remind me of what i imagin wet dog food to tast like 

so whi the two star you ask welli ad one star for the cheap drink price dure happi hour stick to beer mayb 

now i shall find my giraff and ride off in the sunset in search of some good foodnot sure if anyon els was abl to use their groupon here but i wasnt abl tothat was a bummer our neighbor superhyp us about buono and high recommend this place so when i saw a groupon for it i bought it 

but when we went for lunch one saturday there was a sign on the window say they were not accept groupon so i had to notifi groupon for a refundthat took a few day but i eventu got my refund process i think at least a few peopl had contact them about buono becaus i receiv a mass email from groupon apolog for buono groupon not be valid anymor and i also receiv a person messag from the groupon custom support short after

anyway on to the food we start off with spici honey wing as an appet delici the sauc was tangi and flavor although not spici enough but we have a high toler and the wing were gone in a flash we had high hope for the pizza

i had a mushroomspinachtomato slice and a sausagemushroom sicilian slice well i had actual order the veggi slice to be on a whitegarl sauc style but the sauc wasnt prepar yet boo so i had to get it in the tradit style 

the mushroomspinachtomato slice was veri sadlook the mushroom were the can kind blasphemi and the amount of veggi was pretti skimpi the sausagemushroom slice was not my cup of tea but i dont know if im just not fond of the sicilian style 

mi husband order the calzon and was veeerrrrryyyy disappoint with it the crust wasnt good and overcook to the point of be rockhard so it was kind of a pain to eat usual he scarf down his calzon quick it his first choic at italian place but we left with 34 of the calzon intact and i end up have to toss it when i was clean out the fridg becaus he didnt eat the leftov 

all in all it wasnt a great meal but we realli did like the wing so mayb when we have a crave we may order them from buono for takeoutpopey has alway been one of my favorit chicken place in general the lieuten colonel and the one with the church name are somewhat on the bland side and are not my first choic for tasti chicken 

this locat has a few thing to complain about the neighborhood is not the best and it share the same build with the circl jerk guy next door usual find myself tri to get in and out rather quick the custom are alway pretti loud and obnoxi and the place is not veri clean you might even be ask for money in the park lot

servic is basic poor and tri to communic is difficult and a bit tricki normal have to repeat myself a few time to get the order correct on my last visit experienc a tripl sneez by the cook right on my meal gesundheit

usu order the spici chicken with a side of bean and rice cant resist get sever jalapeno to give the meal some addit kick sometim ill even go crazi and order one of the special tri the catfish on my last visit and was surpris how small it look mayb they should just call it kitten fish

definit recommend go to one of their full servic restaur that do not commingl with one of those fast trip place onc had the occas to eat in a realli industri part of baton roug and enjoy the meal so much more than this place what the cluck

225 starthis is oliv garden and i knew what i was get into when i suggest lunch here  i knew rand would be all over the all you can eat pasta and i was right  the onli thing ive ever like at oliv garden was the soup and salad and for 695 you get all that and breadstick  the zuppa tuscana soup had littl flavor and the pasta fagioli which has alway been my favorit was bland and tasteless  even the salad was rather sad onli 1 littl piec of tomato and no cucumber

th ledg of the booth had crumb on it and so did the windowsil  there was scrap of paper on the floor under the tabl next to us  disappoint especi sinc were were the first tabl today

servic was good but i dont think ill be go back to an oliv garden anytim sooni think cold stone is overr the ice cream melt way to fast and get all soupi the cold stone employe never mix the ingredi veri well and i alway walk away think realli did i just do that to myself again 

this locat in particular is never clean the bathroom are a bit scari and they dont sing when you tip them if your in the area and your look for a cold treat skip on over to fatburg just next door and get their chocol shakei went here for a nice steak dinner howev i think nice is actual bleh

al i want was a big fat hunk of delici meat and some healthi veget appar they have veget but i wouldnt call them healthi they have green bean and im sure they are delici with all the butter and bacon they are cook in but i am 100 stick to my new year resolut i ask instead if i could have fresh green bean cook by themselv my waitress said no

no you mean you dont have fresh vegetables

everyth they have is alreadi premad and noth is fresh gross

th steak was bland and i pretti much use an entir mound of salt for flavor it end up be like 20 buck after tip total ridicul 

i dont understand restaur that dont use fresh veget and noth can be cook to order that total gross me out i will not be back if i was by myself i would have left when i found out noth was fresh but i was with peopl and didnt want to insult them becaus one of them chose this placegot togeth with mike c to go out to a thanksgiv buffet today  we tri for golden corral down the street in gilbert but the line was way outsid so we came up here where there was also a wait but shorter  it was good as alway but there were some negat this time

  the soup  there was an ordinari corn chowder a weak cream of broccoli  ordinari chicken noodl  they should have done better than this for thanksgiving

  there was no cottag chees  they dont alway have it but at these price they should have some today

  there was turkey but breast meat onli  no dressing

  over at the dessert bar there was no hot fudg  it look not as if it had run out but rather that they just didnt offer ani today

  there were no sunda cup  i had to go over  get a soup bowl to make a sundae

  there was hot lava cake or hot fudg cake i think they call it here but it was sore lack in lava

thus it down to 2 star for this restaur that wasnt as good as it should have been for the money

thanksgiv buffet 12991249 srthe review on here are waay too nice 

this place is old the pictur make it look soooo much nicer than it is 

everyth here is old im pretti sure the alarm clock are older than me the tube tvs have a loud hum when you turn them on 

the room was big and clean but it had an almost mildewish kinda smell to it the bed was larg and wasnt too bad 

the locat is semi central to a lot but then again it is mesa there an awesom bagel place around the corner 

oh and the toilet let me tell you everi 58 tire it will actual flush 

the internet was super slow if you have an ipad iphon or anyth that need updat dont do it on this wifi 

all in all i would have rather stay at a motel 6 this place must have been cool 2 year ago i wonder how mani peopl die in that roomdear yelpers

i have mani fond memori in the waffl hous around our dear valley whi becaus i went to colleg and i wasnt alway under the influenc of strict oxygen if you know what i mean

th place is what it is highten sensori percept make it burn a littl brighter perhap  but it a friggin waffl house

most sincerely
dr obviousbad food wors service

waitress took our drink order and then twenti minut later the manag came by to tell us our waitress got busi with anoth tabl and he would take our drink order ten minut later the origin waitress came back to get our drink order ummmm hello final got our magarita which were weak as hell and way too sweet and sour

and everyth was slimi im not ocd or anyth but i felt the need to get up and wash my hand after flip through the menu and after touch the salt and pepper shaker and after move the itti bitti littl chip basket from one side of the tabl to the other

ord an appet  the farmer market quesadilla plate was hot but the chees was cold veget were slimi tortilla was burnt and they didnt bring us ani napkin or silverwar we wait what we thought was an accept amount of time for someon to stop by and when nobodi did i actual got up walk across the restaur to the hostess stand where there was a box and got them myselfi visit this starbuck around 10 am on the day after christma it a hot spot evid as the drive thru line was long and there was a line halfway to the door insid 

i chose to park and go insid it was the slowest move line i have seen at a starbuck in a while i order my drink a tall nonfat latt one pump gingerbread which is how i was taught to order the drink at anoth locat i visit occasion becaus i was told they dont charg for one pump 

the girl behind the regist put my drink in as a nonfat gingerbread latt and charg me for the 040 differ when i attempt to correct my order i actual just want a latt with one pump gingerbread her retort was it onli like 020 differ 

well miss moneybag it 040 differ and becaus of your unwilling to accept my order as place i paid you for addit pump of syrup whip cream and god know what other goodi you put on top of a gingerbread latt becaus i certain dont know i onli pay for the crap thank to you i dont actual take my drink that way 

so yeah i have had better and i dont think i will be back ill hit one of the 80bajillion other locat within a 5 mile radius next time im in the east valleysad i cant let my old review stand i hope no one went there base on that review idk what happen butttttttttttttttttttttttttt our food this last time was not good 

the bean on my friend plate look like dri out playdo it was realli gross to look at from across the tabl not gonna lie and the lettuc on her plate was brown and wilti i couldnt handl it

 my food had this weird flavor and honestly

everyth had a weird tast even my diet coke  we both agre everyth had a funni tast idk what it was i was sad bc last time my dinner was so amaz i probabl wont be go back for awhil or ever i havent decidbland bland bland

if you like mexican food with no tast then this is the place to go  the salsa tast like tomato sauc the bean dip had no flavor and i dont think ive ever had a more tasteless chile relleno in my life  not even the pepper had ani tast  the whole plate was cover in chees and mediocr rice and bean  i did like the small side of guacamol the onli thing i like at the table

th servic was lacklust and seem to match up with the food here  

what i did like was that it sit right on a small lake and i would imagin in nicer weather it would be fun to drink margarita and sit by the watercaveat i dont drink coffe gasp so ill be comment on everi aspect but that read other review if you want to know how the coffe is

th biggest sell point of this place is that it open late yes it has free wifi but forgiv me for be underwhelm consid that pretti much everi coffe shop that doesnt have a green logo doe even then their obnoxi password system result in problem get the wifi work on my iphone
th indoor seat arrang is odd which has left me feel uncomfort if i dont get one of the few seat i like the outdoor seat is nice but you wont last long in the even if you dislik smoke nor in the day if you dislik ducks
som fool who go here see fit to feed the duck which dure the day result in duck come to you beg for food and crap near your feet and god help you if you kick them way youll have to suffer the disdain look of the high school girl who often congreg here
th various noncoffeetea drink ive tri arent good theyr usual just a blend of ice some sort of syrup or soda and depend on what you order milk a littl fresh fruit or frozen fruit or ani sort of real ingredi would go a long way instead they seem concern with make these drink as cheapli as possible
th baklava i onli tri onc sinc it tast like it had been sit out way too long it possibl i just had some on a bad day but i wont be order it again unless im realli crave baklava
most of the barista are friend but a coupl are real prcks who will wipe the smile off your face if you interact with them ive also been harass about order quick even in situat where the place is relat empti sorri if i dont want to order and have my ice melt befor the rest of my friend arrive

a i said the primari draw of this place is that it open late and for indi type that it not starbuck but as far as im concern that doesnt excus the crappi noncoffe drink and occasion unfriendli ive experiencive been come to coffe rush off and on through at least 3 set of owner over the past decad 

the decor has improv a mite and they offer wifi now other than than everyth about this place is wors than it was

th coffe is wors the barrista are less friend and less knowledg and the price are more expensive

th park is as difficult to get in and out of as alway sinc the shop is locat on a dead end dogleg of the strip mall

th locat of the shop next to the man made lake could be a boon except for the obnoxi teenag the bird and duck crap the cloud of cigarett smoke and the varieti of insect life

if your look for a noisi after parti hangout thisll do 

if you want good coffe in a comfort environ  avoidgreat locat by the lake that the onli decent part  there no park when it busi the staff is rude and the coffe isnt all that greatsever year ago this was the place to grab dim sum  but much better have pop up and the crowd move on and this fell to the waysid  you can tell easili by the lack of asian customers

on a whim tri it again  meh  egg tart were the best part but there is so much better dim sum not much farther awayoh ma a cheesecak factori gift card you shouldnt have no serious she realli shouldnt have

nesto take helena out for a nice dinner mom say beaming

at the cheesecak factori but i love her

cheesecak factori is ok  for the record i am not a cheesecak fan so that be said

i took my mom out to lunch with the gift card becaus she appreci it and helena pass lol cant say that i realli blame her

th place has issu with identityand size basic cheesecak factori is a bisexu man with a small peni metaphor speaking

i get the feel that even their staff select is base on this premis all veri nice folk but somehow not decis maker in this world so stuck in limbo 

i had a mont cristo it was veri ok my mom could make me betterhey there an idea for next christma mom had the lettuc wrap and a gargantuan salad 

i had merlot my mom had gin and tonic 

it a solid safe bet if you are from out of town and dont want to chanc it on a better independ restarauntalthough if you are on yelp there realli is no excus we will steer you to a great restaurant

 other than that i can think of no real reason to frequent here there are just too too mani great restaur that i want to tri in the phoenix areaall right  it cometojesus time  it hard to watch a thrive busi implod but that what is happen here  ive been a regular at this teakwood for about 7 year now  my husband and i like the atmospher food and friendli so much that it safe to say we even consid this when we bought our hous within walk distanc back in 2007  everyon who work there was welcom and hardwork from the bartend to the server to the busser  the wing and other dish were great especi as sportsbar food goe beer select was good price were reason  weve seen staff and manag come and go but weve remain loyal and actual have stay good friend with mani current and exemploye who have becom like famili to us

but thing have been steadili go downhil and now i think theyv near reach rock bottom  

it start with cosmet stuff  leaki ceil scruffi empti shelv behind the bar for a long time mismatch and shabbi and some downright uncomfort furnish tatti bathrooms

then the food  we use to look forward to the daili special now it seem manag is find way to repurpos leftov or overstock in new and unapp way and frank in weird combin  slice hot dog on a lavosh realli  even one of my previous favorit appet the capres ohnow spell capric on the menu tast bland and worn out  i use to love the creami cheesi meati cheeseburg soup when it appear on the menu but i had it just a coupl of day ago and was disappoint to find it wateri virtual tasteless and sore lack in the meat department

pric were rais dure the recent arizona beer week talk about opportunist and a rash of regular left in protest and have stay away  but i and a dozen or so other regular remain larg becaus of the friend and effici servic of a few remain longtim server there along with a few awesom bartend and wonder busser  the servic in general had also gone down over time but manag seem to want to drive it right into the dirt as they decid this week to get rid of two of their best server  that was the last straw for pretti much all of the regular who had remained

i feel like im go through a divorc  it sad and depress to watch slowli but sure a decent busi and a fun place run into the ground go much the same direct appar as the recent close maricopa and phoenix locat of teakwood have gone by bad manag and poor decis who put profit over people

whi did i even give this place two star for the hand of wonder staff who remainand for the wing which are still great  but if you must have them id advis you to get them to goi pick up some takeout here this even  i wonder if i had gone to a total differ restaur than the 4 star mint thai i had visit sever month ago

on the one hand mayb they are have an off night

on the other hand mayb they have drop signific in qualiti sinc my first dine experience

if you would kind lend me yet anoth hand i have run across restaur where the take out food is like a total differ restaur  mayb mint thai is one of those places

ther is a trend down and to the right in the reviewoh boy oh boy oh boy where do i start

first off ill say that im pretti fair when it come to eat out ive live around the globe and have eaten thing that would make most peopl well you know

but sometim there are place that have strike against them right from the get go such was the case with lulus taco shop

th restaur was well kept with the usual mexican decor strewn about the wall  mariachi music fill the room tabl chair yada yada yada nice place for a taco shop

now the strike 

strike one 
 as anoth poster note 75 cent charg on all card all card not a huge deal but a ding nonetheless fortun i had some cash on me which is unusu yes i know the burden of pay that fee fall on the restaur but that is made up in the cost of good render is it not

strik two
 my wife and i order the taco plate two taco rice  bean when ask if we would like chip and salsa with that i repli sure to which the young ladi behind the cash regist said thatll be 400 oo four buck for chip they werent even fresh made chip needless to say after all was said and done i got out of there 2400 short of cash for that i could have eaten at arriba and been serv my food and have all you can eat chip salsa and bean dip at lulus you pay a high price and are still expect to get up and get your meal when they yell out your order just rub me the wrong way

not happi so far

strik three
 locat if it wasnt for the fact that one of the best restaur in gilbert is liter 50 feet to the south it may not have been so bad but as i sat eat my ahem 400 littl basket of store bought chip i kept look over at flancer wish for a chili verd birdi turkey sandwich that was almost unbearable

on other littl thing that i notic was their beef is obvious grassf and not cornf you get the distinct smell of hay or a stabl as you chew your meat mayb it was just me but it was definit there

al in all lulus is just okay not terribl foodwis but for what you pay servic could have been way better will i go back probabl not youll find me 50 feet to the south 

cheers
shawnwinner of best concept for an expens cafeteria

a gilbert resid and regular to the old town area weve been to liberti market numer time alon and with friend in general we have found the food to be good though at time inconsist and unexcept but accept when in the area not a destin eateri wed drive to otherwis unfortun the servic is uninspir or total lack it gall me when a place charg the same or higher price than other establish that offer full tabl servic and compar or superior food

a recent visit there will be our last the even we went there were 4 of us who were meet to discuss plan of an upcom old town event and we want a quiet place to convers over wine and food this time the servic was not onli uninspir but downright rude

when 3 of our parti attempt to sit at larger tabl with chair for six allow us to more easili view our materi one of the staff said you cant sit there becaus it onli for parti of six he subsequ point to a small 4top and said sit over there in mani restaur the 4top he point out would have been a 2top so our casual plan session was cramp and uncomfortable

to emphas my point even further the place was less than 13 full and it was near close in fact the 4th of our parti a busi owner from across the street arriv onli a about 15 minut befor the manag lock the door 

instead of build custom good will and make us feel welcom this staffer decid to conveni himself and inconveni us

jo bbq across the street definit project a feel of appreci for their patron but the manag team at this restaur where joe is a partner is world apart when it come to community

w realli want to like this place and have been go there sinc they first open in 2009 but after this last encount we will never return as there are dozen of establish in the area that make you feel welcom and appreci as well as offer compar or superior food with the ad benefit of full tabl servici dont know what all the fuss is about  the wait is long the space is cramp and the food was just okay 

i had an omlet with veggi which was good the hubbi had the special chicken fri steak with biscuti and gravi which he said was aw and my girl had pancak with sausag and bacon the pancak were averag but the bacon was cook almost to the point of be charcoal  which i guess is how they cook bacon there  but it was aw and they realli should let peopl know that this is their bacon cook method

th gilbert hous restaur up the road is way better  tight space and all we have been make the round to tri all of the local breakfast joint but we wont be make a repeat appear herevisit my mom in chandler i had a hanker for teriyaki my mom said mikado had a great lunch special so we went

if your idea of special is warm spici tuna roll and chicken that tast like someon made it in a toaster oven then mikado is pretti damn special

i like my teriyaki veri sauci veri sweet and a bit char no such luck

i cant think of a singl thing they did right

i suppos the price was ok 795 for teriyaki white rice miso soup a small salad and a fourpiec spici tunamy first visit to a safeway sinc leav new england  a pretti good experi overal  they were celebr a remodel and have quit a busi saturday

i ask a veri tall woman were talk wnba statur with an overlong and spark rhineston belt which way to the bakeri  she decid the best thing was to escort us to the bakery

i have been escort off the premis i have been escort to the restroom i have even been warn and sent copi over  but i have never been escort to the bakery

w opt to pass on the croissant we came in for sinc they onli sell them in bunch  instead we pick up some doughnut and stop at starbuck on the way out  the doughnut were discount but onli if you have a safeway card  the clerk refus to scan a generic card or give the discount unless i could provid my info to be in the system  oh yea i rememb whi i quit go to safeway  the woman behind us offer her number so that we could get the discount

safeway remain one of the bottom dwell groceri chain in my esteemim weird  i believ in smile at peopl and say pleas and thank you  and in say can i help you  how are you do today  youll get none of that nonsens at this frys

i know a guy who is friend with a depart manag for frys  he said they had a custom servic push one time tell their employe to ask custom if they were find everyth they need and to tell them thank you

aft they hand over their hardearn money and keep you employed

ugh  it is sad you have to tell peopl to do this  this just reinforc i live in a bermuda triangl of bad custom service

thi morn i got cut off on my quest for yogurt by an employe check her phone  she was smile but it wasnt at me  i have a feel it was at the naughti messag on her phone  that is great use of compani time

then i stood patient at the tulli counter while two geriatr gave me the xray howyoudoin littl ladi look  no employe in sight  i even wander around look for one

so i had to risk my life in the cobbleston park lot to get some caffein at dunkin donut  god i hate that park lot

and so im done done doneski with frys and continu on my quest for good custom servic in the alma schoolqueen creek corridorthis review start as one about chompi at the pv mall we will never again go to this chompi  see below

w have been go to the chompi on shea for over two year and realli enjoy the hometown ny food and atmospher it remind us of all the good thing that you would find at katz in lower manhattan 

okay so whi the setup for anoth chompi locat  well the last few time at the shea locat we sat and wait and waited15 min or so for our waiter to come by and ask us for our drink order hey when your busi that to be understood  but our waiter was on break most of time and the place was half empti  also it seem whenev we ask for anyth pickl napkin etc our waiter seem fair indiffer to us  it happen a few more time on differ visit and so we had enough 

well our trek in the desert has been reward this chompi pv mall is everyth the other one wasnt  the wait staff came by immedi and ask about our drink order  offer suggest on differ menu item we were thrill we didnt realiz there was anoth chompi nearbi  and the food was great just like the one on shea

from now on we will shlep the extra 10 minut to the pv mall locat and will tri to forget all about the other one over on shea  if your into katz and some catskil theater then you might enjoy the chompi on shea we didnt  when the wait staff stand around talk while your hungri it a real mood kill

so go to chompi at the pv mall and enjoy the food and servic and feel free tip generous  oh btw there a ton of park avail at pv anoth differ in their favor  enjoylittl known secret about chompi rye bread

at their deli counter they charg a 1 more than frys

factchompi sell their rye bread to frys for resale
facthalf loaf at  chompi 399
facthalf loaf at frys 299

their price have exceed the level of acceptability

our deli of choic is miracl mile  great qualiti  at fair prices
      we no longer eat at ani of chomi 3 locati dont know what i was expect i thought this would be a nice place for a nice breakfast i was expect frill and boy was i disappoitn my mom had breakfast there with a friend at the downtown locat and love it so when we were on a shop excurs to scottsdal this was the natur place to go for breakster 

we enter the crazi busi restur that was all hustl and bustl i was excit we sat down and pour ourselv some water and order our food we laugh at the silli eggcentr western theme paint and wait for our food 

when it arriv it was a bit of a let down the egg benedict were mushi i wish the english muffin was toast more and the hollandais was luke warm at best and becam cold befor i was done with my meal it didnt help that the skillet they serv it in was ice cold i would have prefer it on a warm plate the countri potato arent anyth great  but they arent anyth terribl eaither  my mom love her sun devil egg scrambl with bell peper and onion 

everyth realli remind me of denni and ihop noth was substanti other than the rude of my fellow diner one woman sat and pick at her teeth with her bare hand mouth wide open and everyth anoth man came in without shoe not even flip flop wtf i thought this was scottsdal the hell

to my fellow yelper it noth great save your money and your time and tri somewher elswent there for lunch today and spent 1196 for the buffet and a soda the salad with the fresh veget  was good and the clam chowder soup was ok the pasta wasnt the greatest and i didnt care too much for the bread or pizza overal this place is too pricey especi for lunch sometim you need to revisit restaur to remind yourself whi you dont go there      daili lunch  dinner buffet      

stop in here for lunch today join by mike c  although the dine room is ok and the salad good the tast of the food is all downhil after that  they are now up to serv eight soup but the tast of them as well as pretti much everyth els here was just blah today  the chicken enchilada and albondiga soup for exampl could have been great but instead were just noth  whos the chef for this outfit

theyv switch from blah frozen yogurt for dessert to soft serv ice cream which could have been good but instead it was blah low calori stuff no better than what they had befor  

i actual had a pretti good lunch at their ahwatuke locat not long ago but this one was such a dud today that im afraid it the end of the road for me  sweet tomato  life too short     o

daili lunch  dinner buffet  899809 sr rev 112613a dive bar that featur chines food now those arent two thing you hear in the same sentenc  after tri this place i know whi 

mi buddi and i stop at chop and wok on the way to the airport  and order the food to go the nfc championship game was on in the bar and patio area so this review is a bit late  

we both got the same thing a chicken and veggi combo on brown rice
i bare had time to eat a coupl of bite as we rush to return the rental car 2 bite was 2 too mani  my navig on the other had time for a bit more sad part is the chicken tast like it was still frozen  if you have ever microwav one of those prefab frozen dinner that is the level of flavor this dish had bummer 

had high hope for this place but all i can say is yuck i hate to give it 2 star but that was some bad chines foodjolta java ive had you on my radar for a few month i rememb stop by onc a few year ago and had a pleasant experi this time not so much

th coffe drink i got was tasti and im veri happi that they carri both almond milk and soy milk for us lactos intoler folk this is where my happi ends

thi place need a serious deep clean the floor was cover in crumb the tabl were litter with debri of various food and paper product the fake plant were dusti and if you look up to their massiv ceil all the huge pipe are cover in dust it an asthmat nightmar peopl would finish their beverag or food and then the tabl wouldnt be clean for a minimum of ten minutes

th staff were complet apathet to all of this it wasnt busi so they stood around behind the counter either look at their cellphon chit chat or watch the olymp sad custom servic 

the more i type out the more i realiz that this shop need more than a clean it need an attitud and staff adjust 

i doubt ill returnthis is not good asian food  the veggi stir fri was terribl  the rice was deplor  the hot and sour soup was veri good  a bright spot on the menu  if i was ever forc to come here again i would order that  otherwis this is generic asia food that is no better than the take out you could get at ani mall in ani state in the us  and the servic was slow  not terribl  just kind of absentive been to flos numer time over the year but there seem to be a downward trend  it look like ill be find a new asian fusion spot

th man and i had a coupl hour to kill and hungri belli to feed so we pop into flos for their seem amaz happi hour  i order a froofroo drink which im pretti sure was halfpric becaus it contain half the alcohol it normal doe  tasti but strong um no  we move on to a bunch of appet crab puff chicken satay spring roll bbq pork and pot sticker  the bbq pork was yummi but that is where our satisfact end  all of the other item seem no better than fromthefreez snack i can get at the groceri store  are they make ani of these on site  mayb but it sure didnt tast like it  the crab puff were the most disappoint  so littl crab so much cream chees  they should definit take a look at that ratio and either renam the dish or up the crab quantiti  just a thought

now im off on a journey for a new goto asian spotif amc the 1 cinema and denni were abl to birth a babi from a menag a troi itd be this 

farrelli show not so new yet not too old movi while serv mediocr food it was veri distract to watch a movi while server walk throughout the area serv denni qualiti food i took a few bite of my food and left it ive manag to repress the memori of what i ate so im sorri i cant warn you all about it 

the concept of dinner  a movi at the same time is awesom but unfortun they fail to delivtheir viva las vega roll is alway good but the servic alway leav you with a bittersweet tast 
we dont plan on go backtradit 70s style italianamerican food in a strip mall main notabl becaus you can bring your own wine with no corkag fee  dont believ the hype  this place is noth special

contrari to the mani review here that comment on how cheap it is i found it a bit expens for what your get which is not exact nuova cucina  1595 for two small nonhomemad cannelloni a la cart is not a bargain in my book  their linguin with white clam sauc is some can clam toss with a copious amount of oil 12 a cup perhap and some box pasta for 1295  the 995 insalata romana is a plate of tire iceberg lettuc a tomato wedg or two and a few shred of bland chees swim in a veri tart vinaigrett   

this is the kind of food that use to repres italian food in america befor the food revolut of the 80s  the kind of place youd find not in new york or chicago but in terr haut or tampa at a time when eyetalian food was still consid a bit exotic

th mani review state that this is real homemad italian food are a bit puzzl sinc it neither homemad nor italian  this is veri oldfashion prefoodi italianamerican food and while it ok for what it is it certain isnt real italian food by ani stretch of the imagin nor is it for the most part homemad  

nb no a visit to this restaur is not just like go to itali  for that matter it not just like go to littl itali  i realiz phoenix is not exact a mecca for italian food but wtf peopl  
  
the most 60 crowd seem to love it  i can onli guess that they are overwhelm by nostalgia for a simpler time becaus while it may not be kierland pretenti nor a crappi chain restaur the food just isnt veri good  serious 

the server have a strang attitud that i guess is suppos to be eastcoast or someth rush cocki borderlin rude but seem a bit out of place in what is basic a mom and pop strip mall joint serv can food with plastic red check tablecloth and thin paper napkin  in ani case they are veri select with their attent and you can wait quit a while to get something

also as sever other review have point out they give you a nonitem bill with just the total due written on it which seem to includ an extra 10 or so with no explan offer   this seem quit bizarr to me but appar no one object  at this restaur 1595  1295  995 somehow add up to 4565  the nonitem bill is a weird affect at best  whi would you do that especi in a cheap joint like this  but to do that and then miscalcul  there a word for that in italian  it imbrogliar 

54 for two with tip for a simpl share salad and two pasta dish with no meat and no drinkenjoy a fun uye today to this romano today join by masha z arlin b mike c robyn n norm r and georgi m  although the compani was five star im sorri to have to report that the restaur wasnt     

for this first visit i order a lunch combin consist of mushroom soup sausag quadratini and half a roast turkey sandwich

  the soup tast good but was bare warm enough

  the sausag quadratini had just a littl bit of the italian sausag in it  was most macaroni al dent which for this particular dish is a foofi way of say it was undercook and tough  also  the flavor except for the actual sausag was complet blah

  the roast turkey 12 sandwich had just a littl bit of turkey 316 and almost no sauc of ani kind on the dri bread  there was also noth on the tabl to put on to dampen it up except oliv oil so i use that  

the amount of food for the money was ok but the food itself and the prepar were weak  arlin b had also join me for lunch yesterday at an oliv garden and we both felt that the food was much better there as well as 30 less expens  i doubt ill return to a romano again

3item combin  10this place is compar to buca di beppo

definit for the masswell damn

until tonight all of our experi at red robin had been posit even at this locat our past meal had been enjoyable

tonight thoughtonight left a sour tast in my mouth that not to say that the food was badit was actual pretti good but the servic was atrocious

w thought it was our lucki day when we walk right in on a saturday night and sat right down at 700 we order our appet and drink the waiter cameron came back and took our order a few moment later

our appet came out in record time we had hard taken a few bite of our hummus plate and then our food came out like i saidth food was good

so where was the horribl servic the food was there fast hot and it was good what could have bother me so much

wel i dont think the waiter said more than a dozen word to us it seem like he was late for someth veri import and we were his last obstacl to overcom befor he was abl to free himself from the selfimpos bond of servitud to red robin

customarili the waiter come around after the food arriv and ask how thing tast this guy didnt show up until our food was gone our drink were gone and we were readi for the check and coupl of togo boxes

h begrudg gave me a refil on my drink befor he drop off the check now grant we dont ever get desert in a restaurantbut this guy didnt even give us the satisfact of turn down his delici sound proposal

th whole process felt like we were impos on this kid we were in and out of the restaur in less than 30 minut  this guy rob us of the entir restaur experience

if you cant enjoy the experi then whi go

it will definit be a while if ever befor i visit this locat again but i can promis that ill avoid this kid like the plagu if hes still work against his will at this locatwhere do i start

i like the bread and how it tast it also has a good shelf life after it goe stale i use it to make homemad crouton veri flavor with my recipe

ov the year the qualiti has gone downhil the loav have gotten smaller the price has gone up they say they have discontinu some style but i find them elsewher costco and they still sell the 2 loaf

rec the owner past away just about the time they move locat and were bought out by swiss oven bakeri their 50 person workforc was raid just last week and mesa sheriff dept arrest 28 illeg work for them booo two thumb down on that move guy you should know better whos run your hr department

th newer facil is nicer cleaner bigger and has room to move around in their factori store where you can get 50¢ and 1 markdown product it worth the trip but you have to go earli as soon as they open to get the better select youll see mani local label that they make too like sprout groceri label etc alway a deal when i stop by043013

love the burger and sandwich sometim the kitchen forget to add one or two key ingredi say the anaheim chili i ask for instead of jalapeno pepper or the onion string and the dinner special ive tri at the restaur hard disappoint  but i realli must stop order the pasta dinner special to go  ive enjoy the fettucin alfredo that arriv with garlic bread terrif bread but other pasta varieti have left me shake my head and want for more  take into consider the latest special i order the green chile penn with grill chicken  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfourpeaksbreweryscottsdale2select6gaa2123ljhlmzl2sqkgoa6gaa2123ljhlmzl2sqkgoa  photo was taken befor i had a bite  at 15 plus tax i felt gyp  what do you think  the flavor werent bad though  rich and cheesi and the green chile ad a lot of heat  more so than other cheesi green chile pasta dish ive had elsewher  the grill chicken was pretti good too i dont eat a lot of chicken anymor so when i do order it i appreci when it done right  

i will keep an eye out for this special to appear on the dinner special rotat again but i will order it for diningin  as ive said ive rare been disappoint with the dinner special when dine on so mayb that the secret  we shall seerock bottomwel that pretti much sum it up

thanks

youv been a great audience

dont forget to tip your wait staff the onli part of rock bottom worth a littl applause

im not much of a beer drinker so that part of this chain allur is realli lost on me

i said in an earlier review that some chain are better than other or someth to that effect

thi is one of the chain that they are better than

th food here could sure be betterreally

i had lunch meet at rbb today nope i didnt get to pick but that may chang in the futur base on this swing and a miss

i had their lunch special slidersa dri and lifeless a rack of miniburg as i have seen late and that includ the minisirloin avail at your local jack in the hat 

the lunch includ a stack of over greasi friesjust not much worth tri to eat in this specialbut what can i expect for 695

mi lunch companion had someth that was suppos to be the shrimp enchilada lunch specialalso 695i would have to say that base on her reaction the execut of said enchilada dish was somewher short of successful

isnt there suppos to be shrimp in shrimp enchilada no

mayb we shouldnt expect more for this kind of price point but damn iti do

wer they have an off day 

i dont know but it was a poor effort on the part of the kitchen i cant speak to the breweri partthey may have been crush it today

you know we could have gone across the freeway to vermont sandwich or andreoli and had a much better meal for rough the same price

mayb if they chang the restaur format to rock bottom scotch distilleri it could bring me back

oh and if the food was betterweve alway like joe crab shack and the one at the mill is realli loud so we decid to tri this one anyway it the normal look joe with merchandis to buy the music isnt blast so it was better and better atmospher to eat at the server danc as usual for all the custom everi onc in awhil 

to start off we had the classic sampler which includ fri calamari jalapeno ball tortilla chip with a crab dip the calamari was okay and the jalapeño ball had a realli nice kick to it and the crab dip was pretti good noth great noth to write home about also my wife and son order the clam chowder they alway have to tri everyon chowder this was probabl the most disappoint chowder i tri it and it didnt have a lot of tast plus it was luke warm not good 

for dinner i had the artic bay steampot it had lobster crab leg shrimp sausag potato and corn on the cob it was okay not a lot of tast at the middl of my meal everyth was cold not a real fan seafood was okay the sausag seem like it had a hard skin and wasnt veri tasti the best part of the meal was the corn in the cob 

mi wife had the spaghetti lobster it was serv cold so she didnt eat it wasnt at all impress 

the manag came by to ask us about our food and we told him that the clam chowder and spaghetti lobster was cold when we got it he apolog and took it off our bill plus he gave use a few coupon for free appet 

so as you can see we didnt have a veri pleasant experi today food was so so and cold not impress at all if we do ever come back it probabl wont be for a long time caus there just too mani place to tri good luck at this placewhile my friend rand h enjoy his meal here i was not impress  there are no filiberto in northern california  when i move to arizona and saw them all over i thought i might want to tri them  almost everyon i know said noooooo dont do it  but i did not listen  and i do like to think for myself  not everyon has the same tast so i gave it go the taco shell was a bit stale the meat tast over cook and greasi  there was onli one good thing about the burrito the tortilla was fresh  overal i doubt i will go back but at least i can say i tri iti dont know how peopl can eat here the food is all greas and fat the greas in which they deep fri everyth is off i think  like they havent chang it out sinc the 1980s everyth tast the same and not in a good way in fact everyth about this place is like a blast from the past  it like walk into a museum featur restaur clich from 25 year ago

i felt dirti and greasi just walk into the joint the entir place is cover in a layer of film that neither sticki nor slimi but truli disturb the smell eman from this place both insid and out are all pretti offens too 

the qualiti of the ingredi use is all veri low i wouldnt ever recommend come here to eat we sampl quit a few differ item and they were all vile and made me both regret their consumpt and consid regurgit the slider were a joke  how do you make greasi bread fri are made more of oil than potato pizza puff are basic a twist on a mozzarella stick onli wetter and less healthi howev healthi deep fri chees could be  

there was one save grace though  the salad seem to be decent i wont be return thoughthe food was good but not worth the premium we had a veri attent waitress that we felt did a great job but the manag or owner appar didnt agre he was veri rude to her through out the entir time we were thereit was obvious he was talk down to her he no sooner yell at her for someth then walk into the food pick up area and drop a hand of napkin on the heavi foot traffic area most peopl would throw them in a dirti bin but he pick them up and put them back in the clean pile we were lucki enough to watch him do that from our seat i might have gone back base on our initi experi but after wit the manag or owner behavior toward his staff we wont be back  too bad i love the idea of a local own busi be successmy friend from high school pick me up from the airport and after a bit of discuss on where to have lunch she suggest we come here due to good experi she had in the past it is locat in her old neighborhood in part of a strip shop center that also hous a chain groceri store a bar and some other shop 

when we arriv at the restaur around 1pm on a friday the place was complet empti this to me is never a good sign i bit my tongu out of respect for my friend and we were seat by a nice enough waitress who was a bit needi seem could be due to the lack of custom the owner was at one side of the restaur on his laptop and there was one other person work in the kitchen

aft take our drink order the waitress then told us what was good and what she like i hate that i hate unsolicit opinion especi around food oh well my friend love hummus so we order that to start as i look at the menu i found a lot of item to be the same with a littl switch around of ingredi i also found it strang that the gyro were beef onli but made in hous okay finei will have lamb elsewher i couldnt decid what to order and when the waitress came back with the hummus i ask if they made wrap i want falafel but in pita with feta etc but no rice she said they had wrap and she would get us a lunch menu wtf 1pm on a friday and she give us the dinner menu becaus it is more expens and there were no other custom tre tacki my dear tacky

i order the falafel wrap and had to add feta as it did not come in the wrap i ask if they had avocado and was told they did not have ani my friend had the gyro combin plate off the lunch menu which was 400 cheaper than the dinner menu and it came with salad rice and pita bread 

the hummus was ok it need to be a bit creamier and need a bit more flavor toni is way better as is the hummus from trader joe oh well 

our lunch arriv my wrap had 3 big flat softish falafel they were definit made in hous and could have been fri a littl longer as they fell apart to mush they were over season with a heavi hand of cumin the feta and yogurt sauc were the save grace but i was finish after a liter 2 bite the gyro on my friend plate were okaytend but lack anyth special the rice was bland and white with a sprinkl of paprika on top for color meh  

our waitress came back to check on us a lot ask did we like the hummus how was the falafel tea riceanyth to make contact i was put off by her and the food so i did not respond and let my friend do all the talk 

the onli save grace to this experi was that i was with my friend and when i am with her noth els realli matter all that much

needless to say yes i am a bay area food snob and no i would not come back here nor do i recommend it6 word burn your face shit your pants

if you like over greasi pizza that fall apart with chees slap you in the chin while tri to take a bite then have an immedi stomach ach afterward this is your place

food1what get me is that 1499 resort fee ad to your daili bill whi not just put it in the overal rate  it is a shock when you think wow what a great room rate until you add this on along with tax  
i can get everyth at anoth upscal hotel with breakfast for the same price or a littl less  
when i call to see if this could be waiv they said no 
so if you dont need the casino and smoke there are some fantast hotel waiti am disappoint after tonight 

we were seat quick the place was not busy

mi guy ask what kind of tequila they have he hasnt been here and the waitress snottili says

rud you couldnt have told him a few of your best seller or ani recommend 

our waitress took our alcohol drink order but didnt come back with ani water we were then approach by 2 separ server tri to take our drinkfood order 

a few week ago i was here with a girlfriend dec 272013 their fresh fish taco are done with tilapia gross to me and last time i was abl to switch it out with their mahi

bi the time our waitress got us our drink from the bar we had gotten our water we ask our origin waitress for lemon slice when she was readi for our food order

i ask for the fish taco with the mahi she said that there might be a upcharg there wasnt last time but i told her that was fine i didnt recal what my guy had but it was a combin plate with flouta a chile rellaneno i know i am complet butcher this spell wise sorri and a chimmechanga

aft take our order and our menus the waitress come from the back and tell me that her manag said no to the mahi i grab anoth menu and order the mesquit chicken tacos

stil no lemon wedg she walk around the restaur we ask anoth waiter who finish clean a few tabl put dish away and still get us our lemon befor she doe ugh

our food come and it good i prefer their kickin chicken taco but those were discontinu i guess we ask for some sour cream which they will charg you 130 for annoy but whatever

whil we were eat we saw the manag walk around and usual a manag will alway at least greet us and ask how our food was this guy didnt our waitress had no problem just kind of yank our plate out of the way it must have been a bad night for her

meh it make me sad to write this review food was good but servic and manag are not on the same lengthi loooooveee oliv garden i love their toscana soup i love their warm breadstix i love their salad and i loveee the peach ice tea the servic i do not love it suck 

went in for dinner tonight with my main squeez we were seat immedi but our server didnt come to greet us for a while when she final came over she offer wine but we declin and just order ice water i have to say the servic start declin from there i feel that server almost feel insult if you just order water or they think we are cheap it not true i genuin like water plus when i drink soda or anyth els it make me fuller faster 

anyway they have this 2 for 25 special right now which is a great deal soup or salad to start a full size entre and a dessert to share i got the toscana soup and bf got the salad of cours we share and my soup was gone quick so i ask for anoth bowl she seem annoy by this she brought the soup and then right after our entre came i got the shrimp mezzaluna which i regret it was veri dri it didnt have alot of sauc bf got the chicken alfredo which was tasti sinc i wasnt feel my dish i aask for anoth bowl of soup and she was realli annoy she drop it down in front of me and left without say a word 

im not go to bore you with anymor detail but our server pretti much ignor us the durat of the meal i had to flag down anoth server to get us more water and anoth one to get us togo box but sure enough when it was time to pay she was back at our tabl all bubbl yeah fuck you manag need to retrain their server becaus a lot of other review mention the servic or lack thereof i will tri to avoid this locat from here on outim an awesom wife damnit and dont let anyon tell you otherwis my husband has a thing for the food at hooter yeah right lol so i oblig and go with him to eat at hooter about everi year or 2 yup that all i can stand 

this was our first visit at this locat were use to the tx locat where the girl are much hotter my husband call the girl at  this locat the tuesday daytim shift girl from a strip club and the food appar in tx is better who knew 

beer was 350 for 225 oz not too shabbi there 

mi husband got medium wing while he claim they are tasti and perfect they were definit off on the spice level my husband cant handl spice at all and these had 0 flavor so i guess medium  mild  flavorless at hooter  

lot of tot sound yummi on the menu tot with chees bacon and sour cream but were pretti weak 

and now on to the real lowrat clencher
i dont realli like chicken wing so at hooter i get snow crab leg i know some could call me stupid but honest im not that picki about snow crab leg i can eat some pretti bad one and be happi i get them in tx at hooter and they are fine acceptable
thes were brownishgrey liter and realli disgust i call them the nastiest crab leg ever but then had to retract that statement that honor belong to the rio seafood buffet

bottom line come here for the beer if your so inclin but dont eat anyth  as rufus mention the cocktail server at near ani casino are much better lookwe were seat at a tabl quickly
w were given a highchair and i of cours whip out our daughter babi wipe to wipe down the tabl she is teeth so anyth she see and shes like a bottom fish

i wish i would have taken a pictur becaus after i was done wipe there was my hand print a dark grey out line on the babi wipear you kid me

th girl came around and took our order we order wedg salad a prime rib dip and a burger

salad came out it was good manag walk around or at least attempt to in pretti woman look bootsmak her round but most joke around with staff

w wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait and wait for our food

booti manag come over and ask how we enjoy our dinnerw then inform her that we hadnt eaten yet

sh goe back and check waitress and booti manag tell us separ that it will be one minut or that it next up

whatev that means

food come and it decent worth the wait i suppose

pleas clean your tabl properwith a town that full of gourmet or upscal burger joint and ton upon ton of fast food place one could easili forget about fatburg and if they did i wouldnt blame them so far my experi at this burger franchis could be sum up by the follow word meh

iv been to a fatburg in vega and in mani other citi as well noth that i have consum at ani locat has warrant anoth visit like mention befor with a dearth of burger place here as the say goe beggar can be extrem choosey 

but when that greeney monster common known as groupon rear it head toward me offer me 50 off on food at this locat i had to oblige

so with 16 buck worth of groupon money i had to find a way to get the most out of this singl visit and they had that option for me

xxxl burger  a 15 pound burger of massiv proport at 12 i opt to add top rather than go with the combo so i ad bacon guacamol and a fri egg everi time i have order a burger at fatburg one thing has alway reson with me it is dri they grill it to order from a raw patti and it dri everi singl time the guac was pretti tasteless as well the egg is cook hard which is pointless becaus the onli reason to put an egg on a burger is to see the runni yolk ooz onto the patti the onli thing i like was the bacon

with a price point similar to smashburg id rather go to smash but i would save some dolla even further and stick to the innout the onli good thing about this place is that it open 247 but if all the other place are close and you realli need a burger at that hour i guess it would be alright but onli in those circumstwas fiend arepa so i search yelp and seem like this is one of the onli place serv them  you walk into a littl colombian market and the dine area is to your right  i understand this dine area also becom a salsa danc floor one night a week

th photo on the menu look amaz  i want to tri everyth  

there were a coupl differ kind of arepa and they were decent but none of them compar with realli good arepa ive had outsid of vega  the empanada were soso  they hardsel you on their fresh juic  i got the tamarindo and it was pretti good  for dinner i order the sancocho de gallina which is hen soup w green plantain yucca root and a piec of corn on the cob in the soup  the pictur look incred  but the dish did not tast as good as the pictur look  veri bland and the cliantro wasnt fresh  also the yucca root was undercook  the plantain were decent  the corn on the cob was the same sweet corn use in the arepa which was pretti good

im not sure if ill be go back  mayb if someon came from out of town and realli want to godoesnt even tast like pho nor smell like it

i had ask for extra veggi in my vermicelli and it look like they put in less than most place normal would if i had not ask for extra this plate was ok

mi seat had a bunch of rip in it and when you sit on rip leather it kinda hurt if you wear a dressshortknock knock
who there
pho so 1
pho so 1 who
so i pho so 1 muhfucka wanna fine me first ninja gotta find me what 50 grand to a muhfucka like me
ahahaha that was laaaaaame

vietnames thit and roll are what i had here egg roll spring roll that gave me fat roll are you readi to order ummmw just got here give us a chance

egg rolls
mi friend love their egg roll so we got them they were tasti and they were actual not bad but i just think kinh dos egg roll are better 355

spring rolls
th spring roll themselv seem a bit dri and theyr not fresh the peanut sauc was realli runni 155

9 pho ribey steak
their pho come in either small or larg but i wasnt ask what size i want out come a small bowl of lukewarm pho the broth was lack in flavor so i had to use a lot of sriracha and hoisin sauc 25

54 bun thit nuong cha gio
charbroil pork egg roll with vermicelli and veggi this was good the portion is pretti big you get a good amount of protein and the noodl werent dri even after reheat 45

sure theyr open til 3am but there anoth vietnames restaur pkl not far from here that open 247 and has better food pay at the counter when your done but be care becaus the floor is veri oili and slipperi grossin the bay area i notic a surg of korean tofu restaur pop up  and those that had been around for awhil it appear that they were get a new surg of custom  i was damn curious to see what the hype was all about and with a restaur name tofu hut i figur it would satisfi my curios  we actual pass anoth korean restaur first a new one complet with the grand open sign up  i figur wed tri out tofu hut sinc it had been in vega for awhil and has last  usual it a sign that the busi must be do alright right  wrong

so my first mistak was assum that becaus it had been in vega for awhil it would be decent  the second mistak i made was not check yelp first to see if anyon had anyth about this restaur  if i had done this first i would have seen two 1 star review with no other good review to counteract the two  if i had done this research first you would not have seen me eat here

walk in for an earli sunday even dinner our parti of four chose the cook tabl with the plan to cook some serious meat  instead we order the kimche beef tofu soup 836 two order of short rib bbq 1259 each and a kimche pot stew 895  if you do want to do the tabl barbecu it a minimum two order to do that

they brought out a side salad for each person to start and then five banchan side dish to share  and yes i said five  i thought this was a joke  april fool day haha kind of joke  no  i know at some korean restaur they give out more banchan to the korean so we even ask for more and they said that all they had i thought we were be gyp and look over at the neighbor tabl of six korean to see if they got more than we did  no they did not  tofu hut onli give out five banchan  blah  they were this coleslaw concoct that i have never seen befor cabbag kimche fishcak bean sprout and cucumb  im use to get 510 banchan you can imagin my shock and disappointment

when the tofu soup and pot stew arriv the waitress ask if she want her to crack a fresh egg in there  sure  as she pass over my hot tofu soup she knock over the bfs water glass  no big deal she apolog and clean it up  i was just glad she didnt drop the hot soup too  i had my tofu spici and it was more mild  there wasnt much tast go on here and i was less than impress  i did like the hot stone burnt rice that come out with my tofu soup though  my friend pot stew was more souplik than she care for as well  the onli thing realli good was the short rib  we end up order anoth plate becaus it was pretti good  everyth els fell below par  

to close out our meal the check came  we ask if they had shikhy which is a this cold beverag that is usual serv at the end of the meal  it refresh after a greasi meal and im use to get this automat after our meal conclud at korean restaur  they told us they did not have this  oh my good  five banchan and no shikhy  

final bill 70 includ tip and tax

thi restaur is spars  lot of korean eat here but perhap i just have higher expect and tofu hut doesnt cut iti practic survuv on kfc in high school but over the last 20 yrs it has just lost it allure


i still like the coleslaw  biscuit but the chicken just isnt up to snuff anymor last time i visit i tri the new chipotl flavor and it was just aw the stuff is soooo greasi i can never eat more than 1 pc and im a guy who can put away some food

i still risk it everi time i get a coupon in the maili guess im alway hope it will be good againeverytim i eat at pizza hutwingstreet im alway disappoint i mean how do they make a great person pan pizza but everytim the larg is undercook and flavorless

th wing are noth specialthey charg extra for ranch etc

way to prici for realit crappi pizza20 for pizza  wingi hate to do this  but here goe     i was total crave local food aka mom cook and thought id get my fix at aloha kitchen  im from maui so    there noth quit like mom but i thought this might come close 

our group had the chicken katsu teriyaki chicken and teri beef plate with the rice and mac salad  i cant say ani of the abov was worth a repeat visit 

the katsu  i make better katsu myself and with that be said i think lls katsu is better and    that still ll not mom  this was veri garlici small strip of thin chicken with more crunch than chicken  the sauc was ok not best ever but ok honest could not finish it i threw 12 of it away and i never do that it was that bad  and for the record i had the bubbl stomach gas effect all afternoon  gross

i think i have a problem with their teriyaki sauc  the chicken was averag and teri beef was chewi  sauc was ok but like a 2star say    meh ive experienc better  

i was most disappoint with the hard dri rice  it not hard to cook rice  even my 8 year old make better rice  cmon now  and then came the mac salad which again ll doe better  it wasnt aw but it wasnt great either  and it certain wasnt mom  

would i go back  nope  it close to my work and id love to say i would  but nope  place was pretti crowd though and ive been told to order breakfast next time but i wasnt feel breakfast at 1200 nooni got punish and paid the price for tri a burrito at a place best known for their taco it also kinda help too if i did more research on thing to do and place to eat and avoid when i visit ani citi i know that is whi we have yelp

thi place is open 24 hour and a drivethru which are the onli posit but my 600 so call super burrito wasnt what i was expect for a citi best known for good food 

first of all i love all my super burrito fat juici and wrap tight in a aluminum foil but my burrito from here was small and wrap loos therefor all the key ingredi fell apart on me leav a fat mess the meat bean and rice were also dri and the chip were stale

im an old man and still play with my food so i dissect my burrito and notic i got rip off the shop didnt give me ani chees guacamol and sour cream if i want those fill in my super burrito accord to menu i have to pay extra now i got it  

i end up throw 34 of that burrito away and left just finish my sidral mundet sparkl appl drink which was refreshing

to find a decent super burrito in anoth citi continui shouldv known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dine companion nonalcohol beer instead of the real thing  thank he did not make this mistak with the wine howev it still puzzl me as to whi he brought the bottl to the tabl for inspect but did not think to also bring an implement for open it 

the chicken tikka masala was almost passabl but the assort appet we order were pretti woeful a tini littl plate of dri up littl bite almost indiscern in flavor from one to the next

suffic it to say india oven is not worth put on your list of must dine at spot in las vegaok guy this is a solid yelprecommend kappo place i realli love the overal experi up until the veri end when sudden i got one unexpect  unfortun issu with it when we finish dinner we had order a huge load of food and paid about 57 per person for 2 peopl incl a good 18 tip we exit the restaur and the predomin japanes staff didnt say a simpl thank you the japanes host manag saw us leav turn a blind eye and continu chat with the waitress as if we didnt exist

i regret give you a lower rate i initi intend a 5 but i am an emot and spoil client i got upset im half japanes i know it is not written on my caucasian face but i am my appear is not an excus for anyon to forget to say a simpl thank you especi when it part of the japanes cultur code as we all know even a koreanown japanes restaur in la area is tri to alway say arigato gozaimasu with a heavi accent but still polit and respect i never had an experi where japanes nation oper a restaur in the us or in japan disregard this centuriesold cultur rule

ok the tantrum is over now guy sorri yelp is all about be subject and emot about our experi and it is exact what i am do i wish that i had the desir to write more about the food rather than freak out regard a cultur issue

in spite of the shitsurei hope an isol incid without ani mean attitud or intent behind it i do recommend this restaur as one of the good nihonryori restaur in las vega also conveni it is open quit late mayb other yelper who are less spoil or less familiar with japanes custom not expect as much from their experi will realli have a blastare you kid   folk this is whi i start yelp  to bring truth to the mass  to expos restaur for what they realli are  im in las vega for halloween and i want some good sushi  so i search on yelpcom for sushi in las vega  i filter the result by highest rate and guess what show up   ichiza   sighhhhhhh  this is proof that you cant alway trust what 123 review think about a place  

for those of you familiar with my review you should know how big of a sushi snob i am  you should also know how much i appreci stumbl across hole in the wall sushi joint  i love find a diamond in the rough  ichiza howev is not one   not even close  for starter let talk about the menu  whi do they have a menu  i look over this menu and there were three sushi roll  onli three  how can you onli have three sushi roll  one of them was a california roll which doesnt count  the other was a tempura roll which also is not real sushi   the third was the spider roll fri soft shell crab in a roll   i ask the waitress if they had anoth menu for sushi  sure this cant be it  she explain the rest of the menu is on the wall  what  you mean all those random piec of paper tape to the wall of the restaur  that the full menu  so do you want me to get up and walk around the entir restaur and tri to find and memor what i want to eat  this is ef ridicul  so after i brows the menu wall i found two other roll  one was call the natto roll which was soybean and okra in a roll that deep fri and top with tuna   the other was call the eelkaraag roll which has bake eel and fri chicken in a roll   god help me this was the worst crap ive eaten in so long  the natto roll was funki  i love okra and i love soybean but mix the two togeth and add spongi rice and deepfri it and sudden it disgust   the eelkaraag didnt tast as bad but was poor creat  it just rice stack with a piec of fri chicken and a piec of eel on top  that it  sigh   the spider roll the onli roll that i recogn from other sushi place was not made like ani spider roll ive ever had  yeah they deepfri the soft shell crab but what up with roll it up with lettuc carrot and cucumb  lettuc carrot and cucumb  in a sushi roll what the hell is happen  is this a sick and twist halloween prank  my friend were wiser than i was and decid to order the ramen instead  they thought it was aw  noodl were not cook enough and were hard the broth was not good either  ive post a pictur of them  check it out

ok enough about the baffl menu and utter worthless food  let talk servic  the waitress was quick enough come over to take our order but it took awhil becaus i had to run around the restaur and tell her what i want  onc she gave me my food though she was hard to find  i had to track anoth waitress down twice to get refil on my diet coke  btw they dont have soft drink on tap  onli by the can and they charg you 5 per can  be warn  

if your stay on the strip like most peopl are then this place is a littl hard to get to unless you take a cab  i would definit not recommend walk to it  it also in a pretti ghetto part of town  be care walk back at night  just take a cab both way   

the onli real posit about this place  im not sure how the waitress dress dure everi other day of the year but on halloween they went all out   there was a slutti bee a slutti nurs a slutti angel and a slutti cabaret girl  they were hot  if your into hot asian chick i marri one hot asian chick ftw then youll find them work here  is it worth eat here though  sad no  mayb you can come in right befor close and ask them if they wanna have a drink somewher els far awaydifficult to order server that dont speak english and food that gone downhil over the year at this point im find ichiza izakaya overr 

food run around the restaur tri to order offthewal hasnt been easi or success my usual for the past few year has been the ahi tuna tartar macker nigiri and ramen dx they are perman item and not on the everchang menu plaster around the facil after a recent visit i discov the ramen no longer tast the same and the chasiu has lost the flavor i found so addict i was obsess with the mackerel nigiri saba from here becaus it was cure with a uniqu balanc of salt  vinegar and meld with a bed of yellow fish egg not anymor it plain old mackerel now and isnt special whatsoever

authent my friend from japan work at ichiza a while back she told me stori of underwash veget a caterpillar in a bowl of ramen and how the recip and ingredi are just not what the japanes consid realli good food

servic mayb it just me but i get incred angri when my order cant be taken correct i speak up i speak clear and i speak in an uncompl way that should be abl to be understood the girl here dont understand simpl restaur request and quit frequent get my order wrong i have littl to no patienc for peopl in the serviceindustri that cannot speak or at least understand english well enough to perform at an optimum level

for the sake of my belli and saniti i probabl wont elect to come here on most occas ichiza is no longer the onli place for izakayawas a bit skeptic have lunch here becaus of all the negat review but we came base on my cousin recommend who live in vega and has eaten here numer time

th positives
 food came out veri fast  we were veri hungri so this was a bonus
 food was tasti  we had beef chow fun kung pao chicken roast duck roast pork scallop with veget choi sum fri calamari 

the negatives
 cash onli 
 extrem rude servic  staff was more interest in eat their own lunch than take our order of fill our water cup  actual they never fill our water cup just plop a pitcher of water on our tabl and walk away  as a matter of fact that how all of our dish were deliv  server just drop the dish on our tabl and walk away  never ask us how we were do or if we need anyth  also forgot to give us the rice we order  had to remind the waiter  onli made an attempt at be pleasant when it was time to deliv the bill

wont be go out of our way to eat here againi took my dad here for his birthday he was complet indiffer on where he want to go for his birthday and we both love steak i figur this place was histor in this town so itd be cool to say i have eaten here also i had a live social deal that was soon to expir for all those reason it just made sens to tri it the hostess was extrem friend she kinda set the tone for what should have been an excel experi the ambianc was also pretti sweet it was exact what youd expect after hear that this place has been around for a while and the old time vega elit use to eat here 

after those two huge pluse the main drawback was the server the server here are absolut terribl no person whatsoev no custom servic inattent and even molass would get infuri with impati wait for servic it was a perfect storm of what make someon a shitti waiter after your waiter take your order you might as well say goodby becaus that the last time your gonna see him someon els bring your food which in and of itself isnt realli a big deal your food even arriv in a time manner but your waiter wont be back again for anyth want a refil on your soda nope appar you arent good enough for refil on your soda here at other restaur the waiter make sure everyth is good with your order not here no at golden steer your on your own to track a busboy down with ani request or issu you may have then you need to cross your finger and hope for the best they do howev keep up on your water glass so you arent gonna die of dehydr at least upon look around the sea of seem dishearten geriatr eat their meal all around us i assum that all those peopl came into the establish as bright eye young go getter then they age horribl wait for their check to arriv while simultan lose all the hope they onc had in this world i was convinc i was go to suffer the same fate i even manag to flag down our waiter and gave him my live social voucher after we were done eat onli to have a complet unrel waiter bring me my bill without ani discount show on it for what felt like at least a half hour later i think they were tri some kind of strang crafti server scheme mayb they would take the 50 off the bill afterward and split it who know mayb they just get easili confus when they each have a whop three tabl to attend to 

that whole terribl waiter experi complet took away ani of the old school charm the place could have had it also didnt repres the price they charg for their food around 100 for two peopl without ani discount i have no problem pay for a great meal with great servic but this place left much to be desir it seem aw that the one thing get the least amount of attent in my review is the actual food itself which was actual pretti decent you can do a lot better for your money though i would take the palm steakhous at caesar over this place ani day of the week much much better servic and better food on top of it i believ the price is even a littl better there i was gonna give this place three star but when i read the summari of a two star review it sum it up perfect meh ive experienc better  cue that what she said in 321it been a long time sinc i last visit osaka boy what a differ it use to be a tradit japanes restaur but now it turn into a fusioni bistro i shouldv read the review on here befor going

th restaur is now separ into tatami room teppanyaki sushi bar etc  we got the tatami room which was fine we got a sushi platter zaru soba select from their robatayaki menu and agedashi tofu the zaru soba was actual realli good robatayaki item werent bad either  skimpi portion though the sushi howev blow i was so damn disappoint in the poor qualiti we were given they use to be fantastic

aft this visit i realli wont be return again i like my sushi tradit im kinda a stickler about that the agedashi tofu was quit dismal too not true authent agedashi tofu at all it was so dismal that the young man refus to eat it and he was the one who order it

th servic was attent though henc the extra star they have a late night menu with discount price after 10pmmy cousin love this place we were actual seat at steak n shake and we had this epiphani that we should go get sushi instead so we got up and drove all the way up the i15 to osaka

when you enter your greet by a blank wall what is this  a japanes speakeasi you then turn right and go through anoth door that take you to a small sushi bar area from this initi view youd think the place was tini if you continu to the back and left though you discov that the place can seat quit a lot of peopl they have a teppanyaki area and a surpris number of privat booth and tradit look japanes sunken dine tabl the space is veri aesthet pleasing

unfortun when it came to the food i was disappoint i realli wasnt that hungri but i tri everyth that my cousin order we stuck to their late night special menu that is avail 10pm2am

 beef tataki salad  it look amaz but it lack flavor i think ive onli ever had beef tataki at ichiza and their run circl around osakas
 king crab tempura  this was easili the best thing we order delicious
 salmon skin half roll  this also lack flavor im kind of a purist in that i like to eat sushi exact how the chef made it i never use soy sauc or add wasabi i stuck to my gun on this despit the roll realli need the extra flavor
 scream orgasm ahi sashimi on top of some salad  this also look amaz it had better flavor than the beef tataki but i wasnt blown away by it the dress was a littl too vinegary

on the plus side the servic was excel the two ladi that serv us were extrem friend and attent to our need the green tea tast great and was the perfect thing on my still recov throat whenev i was run low on tea the ladi would come back and top it off promptly

i realli hate give less than three star but i must stay true to the rate system inde i have experienc better it too bad becaus the servic and decor of osaka are top notchfirst this blow denni and ihop out of the water when it come to 24 chain it homemad and there is some love put into it i would give this place a solid 4 for the food on a usual night see it not someth id rate as a 4 for a daytim breakfast it just aok  but today the servic was a miss and my pig in a blanket didnt realli have pig 

we were sat right away and a guy came to give us water and our drink not a serverthen we sat forev and forev bf wave down a guy to ask if someon can take our order we then see him go get anoth guy and overhear their convers that basic conclud that if we didnt speak up we would have never gotten an order becaus the guy didnt know there was anyon in his section gee drink guy or ladi who sat us mayb tell the server if hes on break or mayb if he wasnt on break and do other task to check his section onc in a while with the mani staff we saw hang out in the kitchen talk and hang out or walk by us youd think peopl would notic peopl wait we got our drink refil alright after the server knew we were there 

bf got a chef special 2 french toast 2 egg and 2 sausag  pretti good and standard

mom in law got 2 biscuitsgravi w sausag and egg light biscuit and the gravi was nice and chunki with sausag and mushroom bit pretti decent 

i got appl chicken sausag pig in a blanket good sausag and the pancak were light fluffi and moist big hangup though sheisti on the sausag i have standard size pancak and i open them and onli a half of a sausag was in each pancakeso it onli had  half the pancak cover and the other half a empti lone blanket see pictur cmon most of the breakfast plate have more sausag than that i order the 4 pig think like most place that offer that mani make a smaller pancak or a oval pancak that can surround a sausag from end to end better off get a breakfast special so you can get pancak sausag and egg and hasbrown and mayb even some bacon or ham for the same price and wrap it yourself i just think for 850 i should at least get enough sausag for the pancak disappoint 

 i know i dont feel well and am high off medic but even i notic that the tab was more than it should be see pictur just say check your bill  it was tab at 3938 when it should be 3042 most place give you a electron bill stapl to the origin written pad but here it total on the pad by hand sinc it is just handwritten here by peopl there is a possibl of make mistak 

the 2 star is fair for this night   it seem the rave review about the servic is dure daytim so mayb i will tri a regular shift servicei know graveyard suck but cmon it your job to care and we just want to eat pay for food and tip handsom if you take care of us my standard  20 for good basic servic more for great servic which i think is fair and generous and go on homethe past few visit have been subpar in servic and not so friend so visit have becom far less i havent been in a long while and last night just did me into not go here 

bf and i both order our own taro smoothi with pud when the guy was scoop into our cup he didnt fill it all the way and onc the product sank to the bottom where the pud was it was more than 14th not fill there was a ton of smoothi left and instead he dump it all out i dont get that scroog the custom and wast product 

then when it came to pay it was 15someth wo tip for two drinks

their price definit has gone up sinc the last time i was here and it was alreadi on the high side compar to competitor it too much to ask for milk ice taro powder and pud it busi becaus it the trendi asian late night thing to do

im go to look for a differ place i may not be abl to have late night boba but oh wellsi i can dealit denni it has food it realli cheap if you order off the 246 menu

i wouldnt recommend it although the servic was fine but then again get eight peopl to agre on anyth that earli when theyr hungov lead to some denni  type experiences

so go just know itll be just like the last time you went to denniyelp 365 review challeng 2014  los angel 43  365

mi mom friend best friend treat us for dinner here at pinoy pinay this is just anoth typic filipino restaur youd find in ani other citi the first impress that come to me about this restaur is that it a total dive that doesnt mean the food is horribl id say more averag but not excel 

sinc it in downtown the area is not a great place to walk alon the interior is veri outdat and felt kind of dirti let be honest here the food is not that great but the price are excel and save us a ton from eat on the strip the place kind of remind me of an old filipino restaur i ate at in glendal in the 90s 

the food wasnt that bad more so and so i pick up a tray and order the two item combo pork barbecu skewer and chop pork food was a bit cold and tast old the flavor in the barbecu was there and so was the chop pork but they give you lot of rice 

would i come back here again maybour waitress was a superstar  older woman and so friend and attent to our need even anticip our need have our grand daughter there  oph was my first job in mid 70s actual inspir me to becom a chef and restaurateur  my main job was prepar the famous corn beef hash in the hawaii locat sinc then  ive alway made ohp my home and boast on their food and qualiti especi sinc ive live in portland  or where the origin locat and famili resid boast the famous pass down starter cultur that make up my belov dutch babi so one thing i know and know well is oph food especi the corn beef that ive made all my life 

2 star are for my waitress and her servic which if yelp broke the rate in categori id give her 5 star and hire her ani day in ani if my restaur 

now to the food  it just suck period the dutch babi was so flat and pancak were sour onli mean they dont follow protocol for the starter and batter was old and not kept refriger caus it to sour my so call corn beef was a blatant ripoff they tri to pass off their older ham chop up and with onion all fluffi and they couldnt make hash with ham becaus it come out like fluffi hamburg  even waitress said other complain the same thing  dont take my word for it see for yourself  all i ask is you know what corn beef is and eaten at other locat besid vega they are cut corner to save on food cost and wast shame on you

mi concern and disappoint was address with the manag or owner  the older gentleman but he deni my find as a profession chef and was extrem rude even though i was be courteous  this lead me to believ that the cook run the place without challeng or proper manag  i will forward my find to portland along with the pictur of the fake corn beef  i did pay for everyth and never ask for a discount or ani refund  it just a crime what theyr do to such a wonder franchis and food concept 

chang manag and food and mayb we wont lose our last oph in vegathis review is for the bar counter servic only

thi is a realli hard review for me to writewhi  becaus i love this place but last night the servic was so bad i have to give it 2 stars

th better half and i enjoy go out to place that offer flight of wine  we enjoy sampl differ vineyard without the cost of pay for a full glass of wine  grape street is our go to place for this  normal we dine at a tabl and enjoy a full meal with our flight  howev last night we decid to go to the bar becaus we didnt plan to eat  it was a mistake

th bartend servic was horribl  we had to get our own menus  we each order a flight of the zinfandel and glass of water  onc she pour the flight of wine she didnt bother to tell us anyth about the wine  normal they will tell you which glass contain which wine and will give you a brief descript of the tast  flavor  she was more concern with this guy who was sit at the bar  keep in mind that there was onli 5 peopl at the bar includ my wife  i when we arriv  within 20 minut there was onli 3 of us remain at the barsh spent all of her time chat up the other custom  meanwhil our glass of water sat empty

i finish my flight befor the better half finish hersthat alway the case  i was interest in have anoth glass and was consid one of the cabshowev she was nowher to be found  the bar was left unattend and who know where she went  final she appear with food for the other custom  i wait until she deliv his order then i flag her downsh say just one secondthen she bolt from the barwhat the   i watch her as she walk around the restaur and she came back empti handedwhat was so freak import that you couldnt take a drink order from a custom at the bar  

when she final came over i ask if i could sampl one of the cab befor i made my decisionsh said sure and pour me a small sampl of the cab i request  then she walk away to do someth els in the backdidnt she want to know if i want to order a full glass  come on  by this time the better half said screw thislet go have a glass of wine somewher els where we will be served

a server from the restaur came to the bar look over at us and could see we were irritatedask if we need anyth i said check pleas  she went in the back and found the bartenderwho came over and said didnt you want anoth glass of wineha not tonight and not with your crappi servic  i paid the check and we were on our way to anoth place

i didnt get the bartend name but she had dirti blond cur hairi rememb who she is becaus when we come back i will be sure to avoid the bar if shes working

thi place use to be so much better than this  i dont know what go on

wil i return  yes but will onli sit at the bar if shes not the bartend  well sit in the dine area if necessariive discov i realli dont like tjs the store was pack at  around noon on a weekday it doesnt help that the store is so small and everyon stand around block either your way down the aisl or from look at product where do these peopl come from what happen to common courtesi i felt like i was in a compress version of walmart i did buy a few thing sinc i was there some price are okay and you can get some cool product you cant find elsewher but it not worth the troubl check out was not ani easier everi check out was open and about 5 deep it took foreverit nice the cashier are friend but you need to learn how to do 2 thing at onc talk and check out peopleit realli not that hard i realli doubt i will ever go backpretti much the most blah sandwich ive ever had this place make subway look like gourmet i order a veggi was not given a choic of bread just a plain white roll was use when ask what my chees option were provolon and provolon uh okay and i dont like mayo but love yellow mustard we onli have dijon 

mi sandwich is liter white roll provolon chees lettuce
tomato avocado dijon mustard and yeah that it 7 for a meal i could be dig a footlong at subway right now with 5 differ chees varieti 

passthe best thing about this place is the view on the patio 
ive never bought wine here so this review has noth to do with that part

iv been here a few time now and im not impress the last time i made a reserv for brunch for a parti of 11 around 1pm i want a nice relax scene for my friend the morn after my birthday parti 

the reason i am not impress with this place of busi 

the staff was not so pleasant they seem to be look at our group with more of a snotti attitud and they seem to not be veri genuin 
the waitress emili was not at all tentat she seem annoy that we had a larg group and she didnt ask to refil half of the group drink took over 30 minut just to ask what we want to order drink and food we had to call out to her over 3 time just to get her attent i dont ever see this be necessary
it liter took us 2 hour just to eat and pay onli due to the fact that she did take care of us 
it was not busi she was not busi if it was busi there we all would have understood i watch her as she tend to other tabl and she was great with them not one person ask for a manag or complain to her becaus the group doe not like to caus a scene or  problem 

the same group ate out 2 other time over the weekend and we never had problem elsewher 
i never thought it would be a problem have a larger group there due to be there at other time and see other larg group dine here 
the food here has alway been good that is on the plus side 

if you are picki about servic i have not had one amaz experi here ive had decent servic with just my boyfriend and i dine here 
i alway tip a minimum of 20 if it awesom servic i tip over 30 i gave her the bare minimum of 15 she honest deserv less i appreci great servic becaus ive been in this industri for over 10 year 
i hope this restaur see this review and i hope they revamp their custom servic it doesnt matter what your group look like rich middl class or poor how larg or small your group is you should alway be will to provid the best servic to all of your custom equal each person in the group was veri disappoint with our servic and i was embarrass for bring them here we are not a rowdi or raggedi look bunch just peopl who are happi to eat good food 

no matter how good the foodviewambi is if you have horribl servic it ruin everythlet get the basic out of the way right now the food here is delici and the wine select is veri good none of my comment below relat to the actual tast of the food they serv 

that said

i realli want to like march bacchus and most of the time i do i have some friend who are fond of the place so i end up here for workday lunch fair often not everyday often not even everyweek often but staffrecognizemyfac often often enough that we have a favorit tabl and the staff know where it is okay good

howev have patron the place for year ive begun to notic certain trend or mayb just one trend everi time i go it wors than the last time i went

a coupl of year back i would regular order the half pound burger which at the time was 11 it was a good solid burger but the kitchen staff regular had troubl get it to come out at the right temp if i order medrar i got rare if i order medium i got well done aggrav but not the worst thing in the world and the thing tast good so i didnt care that much they also had a 9 housemad paté appet that came with a salad oliv and cornichon the staff would keep us top up on ovenfresh baguett and french butter it was amaz wed do the paté and then id either get the burger or one of their sandwich and have a nice relax lunch with some wine and a view of the lake

wel those time are over the paté appet is long gone replac by a 16 charcuteri plate with less food on it the chees plate at 17 is ridicul small the delici freshbak baguett has been replac by some indiffer warm ciabatta roll for some damn reason your a french restaur serv french bread the burger come out at the right temperatur now but the price is up to 15 and the last time i order the steak frite i got about three littl medallion of steak and a whole pile of frite where the steak go oh it over on the dinner menu and it cost twice as much okay

to me dinner seem like lunch onli more so but i dont usual go for dinner so ill keep my mouth shut about that

a long time ago mb was a wine store that also made pretti good sandwich the ambianc was garbag and the staff all one of them were sur but the view off the back patio was nice then the place chang ownership and thing improv steadili for a while until they had a real proper equip restaur with a full menu of reason price hearti delici dish these are the time im rememb so fond in the text abov not even two year ago i would have recommend march bacchus to ani and everyon and i did but these day it tri to be a hoityto tinyport hautecuisin restaur and it not quit succeed 

i have no problem pay a lot for a small portion if the qualiti is there i get fine dine okay i have zero problem drop money on a nice meal my problem with mb is that the price have gone up the portion have shrunk down and the actual food hasnt improv all that signific yeah they can cook beef to temp now but theyr a restaur if you cant cook beef to temp you got problem yo

th folk at march bacchus have a lot go for them they have a wonder wine select a great locat and loyal custom but they need to take a step back and tri to rememb what made them so welllov to begin with then tri to do that again becaus they arent do it now and it sad it a classic case of a restaur that bought into it own hype and stop pay attent to what realli matters

it still not a bad place to eat lunch especi if someon els is pick up the check

 upon further consider im drop my rate to two star after read some of the peopl under me some of you are far far far too kindyike after quit a nice meal here two year ago i organ a brunch for my mommi group and the servic was realli pretti bad
w had a reserv for a parti of 8 and after be sat wait 45 minut to order then subsequ had to wait and wait and wait each time we ask for so much as a refil on water twice a porter came to refil water and then walk off with sever of the glass still empti never to return with more water we ask for our check in the middl of the meal becaus we could forese it be a looooooong wait and unfortun we were right
when the manag came over to ask how everyth was my friend mention that the servic was realli realli slow he seem surpris and eventu told us that it was becaus we need separ check when we nice let him know that everi aspect of the servic had been slow not just the checkget portion he mention the separ check again and blame our wait on an outdat comput system when he came back 15 minut later to find us still wait he told us he had comp our bottomless mimosa due to the wait  which was nice of him onlynon of us had had bottomless mimosa 20 although 4 of the 8 had had singl mimosa 8 we all said thank good that we had order the singl becaus i cant imagin how long we would have wait for a refil on the bottomless one 
i do understand that separ check are not ideal when i organ a group outing elsewher in the futur i will definit remind everyon about bring cash but they cant treat separ check like some sort of puzzl phenomenon that has never been encount befor and the separ check situat just doesnt excus the long wait and poor servic in everi other regardi rememb when this place was pretti cool  when it open in 1994 it chang the game for local casino  it was onc known as the royal flush capit of the world  the buffet attract ton of peopl from all over the vega valley and it was hop everi night  that was when the maloof own the joint  

fast forward 17 yrs laternow this place is a shell of it former self  i walk into this place a coupl of week ago and it hasnt age well  the vibe it onc hadgon  the excit at the slot and tabl gamesgon  the happi employeesgone

mi desir to return to this placegone

return factor  5overal the food isnt good i explain below but this place may still be worth local time and more import money  let me explain

ther are not mani old restaur in this town we dont seem to valuefrequentpatron place that have been around put out food for a long time i think we should even when the food isnt show stop whi this place has tremend charact and charm there an old western vega feel to bob taylor establish in 1955 it the oldest restaur in las vega it a throwback to a rug carnivor cowboy cultur that has exist in this town for decad and still exist i did appreci the slice of vega kitch that bob taylor offer 

food issu so with all that charm how could this place go wrong this place could be great it realli should be great but they are not put enough care into the food i order the rib eye and ask for it to be medium rare i was worri about it be overcook and figur if a mistak was made id be in the medium rang my instinct were correct but the steak was closer to well done in total three steak at our tabl were serious overcook in a steakhous with a man task with grill the steak sigh the fourth steak smoke prime rib was cook proper but the prime rib is cook ahead if time right how was i prepar for this overcook piec of meat how did this onli occasion redmeateat suspect that my steak would not be treat with attent care 

ill tell you when we walk in there was a larg grill at the front of the restaur with a number if steak cook on it but the chef was not watch the meat he wasnt even in front of the grill he was nowher to be seen as we walk through the door and there were at least 4 steak cook when we arriv so i figur that my steak would receiv the same lack of attent  

i order a simpl nake potato and a side salad to accompani my steak both were fine but there is not much room to mess up a potato and iceberg is there peopl rave about the garlic bread and i think it becaus the rest of the meal is so mediocr that the cheesi bread becom the highlight if the meal it was just ok the most inexperienc cook could make it at home with sourdough butter and three type of chees 

a few peopl in our parti order the mushroom rice side dish and it was not good after tast it i was grate to have pass on this wet mush 

servic our waitress was veri attent and respons she was more than will to return the overcook steak 

i wont be back but im glad to have visit this histor spot

servic 4 stars

kitch 4 stars

food 1 stari had a coupon so stop by for lunch it was still to expens i had a turkey club  and a doubl slice of chees pizza with coupon it was still almost 11 and my pizza was burnt to hell i couldnt even eat the pizza becaus all of the burnt black spot just didnt look right the turkey sub was just okay i can get a bigger sub from subway that tast better with the right coupon i do like certain thing here but they arent consist as far as the tast and qualiti of the food there is a drive thru or you can eat insid and get free bread stickat the most two star  what a dive i book my staff there tri to save some money for the year for a convent last week  i love the locat just 5 minut from the mandalay bay convent center but what  a sacrific of qualiti  

the minut you walk into the casino it reak of smoke and seem to be an attract for what seem like the homeless  we park in the back and left via poolsid as much as possibl  the room were corni and cheap but clean and surpris quit 

the girl deal were realli not all that good look just silicon fill  this place was pretti much a big disappointi want an owlzilla and i want one now stomp feet

fat bastard wouldnt sell me one and they are the onli good thing about this place  except for wing read below

th casino is the size of a peehol  the girl do not have hot hootz or hot ass  fuhgle bitch in tight orang short shini hosieri that pantyhos for hos ohhh you all know the uniform

servic is slow  the bartend chick was ugli and rude and pour weak drink and i was pay for these drink  i understand to order beer if im gambl but my pretti lil ass was sit at the bar and i expect some vodka with my soda thank you veri much

whi two star  becaus after 11pm they serv 10 chicken wing for 250 and im a girl who like a bargain  the 911 wing were pretti spici  almost a lil too spici but darn tasty

nev again not so hot hootzer unless im nearbi and crave wingi was in vega recent on busi at a trade show saw some buddi that i use to interfac and partner with and so we decid to go out and eat and catch up 

let see you are in las vega on busi and of all the choic where would you want to go sinc their compani is veri cheap they have a veri small expens allow and sinc their compani definit has a macholik person sort of a frat brother locker room personna they chose hooters

i said are you kid me i suggest go to chinatown and get some good inexpens food like thai korean chines vietnames and i had a car to take them all out there but sinc it was 3 of them versus just me it was hooters

hoot hotel and casino is exact like their restaur girl in white tee and littl orang gym short you would think that here in vega this would be their flagship locat and they would upscal it in decor amen and staf 

nope 

even though it is a hotel and casino it has the same look and feel of their restaur what do they call themselv tacki they got that right

plus hooter has aw food deep fri tasteless unimagin it food you might find in talledega at the nascar race in the picnic cooler of the basebal cap wear hvac and cabl repair men onli warm up a bit 

in vega with all the beauti women work here in the various servic venu of show casino gentelmen club etc hooter has got to be the bottom of the barrel the talent here is just abov 7 eleven just wear less that make the food that much more indigestwe were stay across the street at the mgm grand and everi time i look out the window by the elev i saw the owl on the hooter casino sign stare at me  it was hypnot and there is a strong possibl that the sign may have even wink at me or mayb that i just need to get some more sleep  so i got a coupl of peopl to walk with me across the street on an adventur to the hooter casino 

from the outsid it look like an overs hooter  on the insid the casino is tini and smaller than anyth i have seen on the strip  we were abl to walk through the entir casino in less than a coupl of minut  there wasnt veri mani peopl in the casino and there seem to be more employe than patron on a saturday night  all of the dealer were hooter girl deck out in their white and orang gear  the theme of hooter was evid and well maintain throughout

when we got to the back of the casino i went into the store to check out what they had  they had some cute hooter brand cloth and i found a jersey top that i like to buy for my wife  after that we took a look out the back door of the casino to see the pool  it was pretti sad  there were just a bunch of dude hang out and not a hooter in sight  the pool look like a giant size motel 6 pool and did not look like a fun place to hang out at all  so we head back insid toward the front of the casino  we pass two restaur on the way  one of them be a hooter of cours  when we got to the front there was anoth store that i did not notic when we first walk in  this store had lot more cloth and hooter paraphernalia so i went in to check it out and end up buy more stuff  they had a special in the store that if you buy 35 of merchandis you get a free gift  the clerk at the regist inform me that for a 150 i could buy a sacki bag  i thought i was a 150 off of hit the 35 mark and so i agre to get the bag  it turn out that the bag was anoth promot and that my free gift was actual a hooter girl calendarfrom 2010  i

aft buy all of the cute hooter gear for my wife to wear we went on our way  now that she has all of these cloth i dont have to bother go to hooter anymor to check out the girl in the itsybitsi outfit  i look forward to val make me a teriyaki chicken sandwich in one of her new hooter outfit and im pretti sure i wont go to this casino again  there realli wasnt anyth special to see or do herethe mission is onto find a decent dim sum restaur in vega and cathay hous was first on my list  origin from san francisco find a stellar dim sum restaur in the desert will definit be a challeng  but im on it

cathay hous was vote best dim sum in the local paper and receiv other accolad as note on it wall  i had high expect  

it was bustl on a sunday afternoon and there was a 1015 minut wait for a parti of 2  onc seat in the main dine room ice water tea and fork arriv immedi  fork  okay so there were chopstick alreadi on the tabl but i guess out here they are use to peopl ask for fork  

there wasnt a huge varieti of dim sum dish to choos from so that was alreadi disappoint  i did tri the chicken feet in black bean sauc  this dish lack the full flavor that im use to  the standard shrimp dumpl har gow and pork dumpl shumai were basic if anyth  the salt and pepper shrimp had been sit out too long after be stirfri not a good choic  the beef rice noodl with a light soy sauc should be cut up to share a bit easier  the crab claw puff were average

i was anxious for the shanghai dumpl which they did not have  or the shark fin dumpl in soup with red vinegar and ginger slice to dip into  two of my favorit and they were not avail  and trust me i did ask more than one employe for it

look around for dessert there were no egg custard tart avail or black sesam roll  i did see the sweet tofu but that was about it     

there were a lot of dish that werent be order in other wordsthey look stale as they pass our tabl numer of time  when you see the same cart pass you when you first sit down and realiz that the same dish are still not move on it an hour later the turnov of food is not happen here

i also think it odd that they serv dim sum until 10 pm  in my opinion a true tea hous restaur should onli serv dim sum dure brunch hour  that is the whole point of drink tea aka yum cha or go for dim sum  

overal i dont plan on return here unless i havent found a better place yet  my dine companion say this place was worthi of a three star in the past but he had to chang his review to a two now  sad sadthis mcdonald is connect to the terribl conveni storega station and not particular one of my favorites

it conveni when your drive down blue diamond from the west but i think the staff could use some train in the custom servic end from the other mcdonald nearby

th last time we ate there we watch and listen as one of the staff member holler from the dine area to the kitchen  appar she was on break and eat and still want to maintain her convers with her colleagu so she continu it by scream across the dine room and they in turn holler back  veri profession group here

im sure all the other custom enjoy the show as welli cant afford to be polit correct enough to shop here   the crap is all overpr nonsens anyway  when a store make whole food look cheap someth isnt right

if you want local produc peopl go to the farmer market  what is the sens in pay so much more for produc that isnt much of a cut abov ani of the larg groceri stores

a for peopl watch i dont find it at all interest to watch pretenti colleg kid and bourgeoisi hippywannab shop for foodto say i was disappoint with frida would be an understat 

we went here to that we could hear jazz in the squar while enjoy some sangria  the sangria most just tast like water down franzia  there was no fruit or anyth in it at all  

after get our pitcher of sangria we thought we should order someth even though we werent hungri just becaus we were take the waitress tabl for an unknown period of time  we order some type of chees appet that was so bland i cant rememb anyth about it besid that it was gross 

the servic was quit friend and they werent pushi tri to get us to leav so that is the onli reason they are get 2 star instead of 1sigh i realli hate it that i like starbuck coffe better than the local guy but in most case it true still look for my perfect latt in madison at a mom  pop shop definit didnt find it at espresso royal my latt tast like it was made with kerosen instead of espresso

th staff were friend and the ambianc was fine but if ive gotta buy someth to get the free wifi i want it to go down easi2nd stop off the rail pup crawl a littl walk nice place for regular but they did not seem to like have a larg excit group there the server was good the drink were good and the price was good 

the restroom stunk like old pisswe went to my florist with four other peopl we met through yelp the idea was to have brunch it was 11 am on a sunday but when we arriv and were seat we were extrem disappoint to find out that they were no longer serv brunch it was pretti hard to recov from this blow but we were hungri and alreadi seat so we had to forc ourselv to abandon dream of pancak and egg and pick someth from their lunch menu 

i chose the portobello sandwich 1025 and my husband got the roast beef sandwich 1250 we both also got bloodi mari both the sandwich and drink were disappoint the portobello sandwich was ok although the mushroom was a littl overcook and rubberi and the foccacia was a bit greasi my husband roast beef sandwich was even wors though not onli was the roast beef far from rare as the menu promis it would be but it look like my florist had pick up subway leftov cold cut and repackag them in a sandwich that cost 3 time the price the cheddar also tast super standard think kraft singl for 1250 the sandwich should have tast a lot more premium that it did 

we did enjoy the light and bright atmospher insid the cafe and thought it was a good environ for convers not too loud but not quiet and awkward but were veri disappoint with the food if we actual wake up earli enough on a sunday to make it there befor 11 we might give this place anoth chanc for brunch but sinc we dont live that close we probabl wont go out of our way to come backi saw the review of the day today and had to throw in my two cent this is my least favorit lunch stop ive ever been to downtown 

it usual suggest by someon in the offic who just want a red sandwich meat sandwich and want it fast then the rest of us have to suffer too 

veri typic sandwich like turkey roast beef etc etc i might like the place better if i ate alot of red meat the peopl i go with swear that the traffic jam sandwich a cluster fuck of differ red sandwich meat make it worth the trip the top are veri pedestrian and limit they will charg you to put someth fanci like black oliv on it

i would also challeng the clean assert made by anoth review although they have a ton of employe to run a pretti tight ship in term of make sandwich quick and clean up we have had sever incid of find question or disgust item in the food weve order so as to make mani  peopl in my offic never want to go back

i give them one star for make a decent sandwich that i couldv made just as easili at home and for cheaper the second star is for their milkshak which are made with real ice cream in front of you and are pretti good go to sack duck and decant downtown deli or one of dozen other downtown sandwich place first befor herelolo is a nono

thank good for the green  they were tender and delish  but is it worth drive there to get green i dunno

th coat on the fri okra was hard

oh noooo the red velvet cake was the worst  if there is red velvet cake at an establish ill alway tri it  i was sooooo disappoint with this one i onli took two bite and had to push it away  it was too dens and it tast like there was ton of oil in it  the cake didnt have flavor just red  the frost was waaay too sweet  tri tammi coe instead

ruin my meal to tell you the truth so i ask for their infam red velvet cake to go she put it in a paper bag and near slam it on the tabl befor walk off i cant even tell you if i like the cake i was so mad by then i just want to leav 

not realli what i call one of my better experithis was almost a one star review i realli enjoy the food burrito bandito creat and im crave one right now

i use it on bb 129 monday for taco and burrito 
mmm i could go for some right nowi went here today for our compani depart holiday brunch and the best thing i can say was at least i wasnt the one pay there were rough 30 in our group which isnt an easi task to handl so the buffet style version of fajita made sens to serv there was a choic of either chicken or beef with rice and bean taco size tortilla all the food was serv bare warm with littl flavor you could indulg in sour cream  the salsa that probabl came from a jar also no flavor i got the rice with no flavor and the chicken that came with a bonus 2 inch bone luckili i surviv to write this review the decor is still slight charm with photo of geronimo  jame dean although the onc famous sawdust was remov due to fall their saloon girl still hang from the ceil but she too is desper need of a makeov the employe uniform are date but the servic was decent 
this onc belov  famous landmark type restaur is unfortun on it way to becom a ghost townhave recent move to the neighborhood im on the prowl for a new pizza place i was look for one that deliv but pullano is close enough for pick up and i read good thing about it so i thought id give it a shot

i probabl should have stuck with pizza but we were in the mood for a full homestyl meal we order a veal parmesan a chicken parmensan two wed soup and a burger for the kid 

the fact that they had burger should have been a minor warn sign the fact that they also have a full mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin neon sign

lik most place in the valley pullano is tuck in a shabbi strip mall insid it veri cheeri and friend the wall are chock full of sport memorabilia from the local team they support as well as some knickknack and tvs air sport it been around a while and that made it rather comfort and neighborhoody

th staff was all smile and after a short wait had my food readi to go the price for our meal was around 30 not bad

onc i got it home and unwrap it well yeah the veal parm was one of those chop and reform patti dows in a bland tomato sauc and top with mozzarella the chicken was an actual chicken breast serv in the same way but had the textur of a dog chew toy not that ive actual tri one

on a bright note the italian wed soup was realli rather good in fact we have toy with the idea of order from pullano again  but just soup and garlic bread or mayb a pizzanot in a burger mood i went for the fish n chips
hello rubberi batter
pfffffft that how you spell the sound a fart makes
fri were yummi  order process was organized
ppffffffffffffttttttttttt
i like the differ varieti of tea  i dont like mine sweetened
good lunch hour crowd  lot of men
ppppffffftttttti have never been to thai rama i have alway want to tri it but it wasnt realli close or conveni to go to i happen to be in the area so figur would check it out food was less then spectacular after 20 yearsi am not realli sure if it just down grade from qualiti or bad supplier i dont know the spring roll total from a box flash frozen the insid were mushi and the flavor not distinct also got the won ton save grace here they were good the pork nugget insid of it could stand to be a bit bigger it is dwarf by the won ton wrapper still was realli good 

i have chosen to make pad thai as my baromet for thai restaur im go to review on yelp if they cannot make this signatur dish then the rest of the menu might as well be rat poison the pad thai was flavor the noodl were a tasti pile of mush it had realli long mung bean which i like so it wasnt all bad in fact it wasnt bad tast but honest for 9 buck i could have pick this up at safeway from a box call tast of thai for 250 and cook it myself 

atmospher is ok kinda old cute menus with home made paper with the menu item print on a transpar hmm now that i think about itit kinda chees but whatever

 servic was good quick turn around and my glass was onli empti twicebut to think about itthey onli fill it twiceso it was emptyso that meansi was thirstyand my drink was empti hmmm ok that kinda nit picki it was fine 34 star if the food was umm fresher or at least not suppli by sysco 

in conclus this place might have been around for 20 year but when there are not better option thai basil thai eleph wild thaiger even thai hut and your the onli thai restaur in a 20 mile radiusyou can last but i shouldnt need to point outthat you have some serious competit in the areaand their price are about the same

i realli want to make a funni review about this place but let face it thai food is seriez biz onli deserv a serious reviewi went with such high hope too

i had the red curri beef well the beef was veri strang in textur and odd shape i hope it was beef 

mi friend had some kind of stir fri shrimp green bean and currychili thing the flavor was veri mediocr by that i mean how the hell do you make someth with curri and chili bland

th papaya salad was not veri good  too much lime juic and a bit of an off taste

w both woke up the next morn with stomach ach coincid i dont know but i probabl wont be back eitherhmm im not sure what i was expect from my first tast of nativ american food but my navajo taco from the fri bread hous was did not live up to ani idea i had  the fri bread is good enough of cours anyth you deep fri is usual tasti but the taco was super bland and noth interest  it basic was fri bread with lettuc bean and some chees slap in it  

when i add the lacklust food to the fact that the man at the counter was not friend at all rude actual i dont have a veri satisfi feel about my experi  my friend was tri to order the stew and some fri bread and the man treat him like he was dumb for not know that you have to order a combo to get both  then when we ask what drink they had the man kinda roll his eye and point to a sign again like we should have alreadi know where the sign was or what their option were  realli  we walk in and right up to the counter so we didnt have much chanc to familiar ourselv with their exact setup  i almost said someth but didnt want ani chanc of retali in our food 

so my friend stew was full of flavor and my taco had none  the onli save factor was the dessert fri bread at the end 

id go back to tri other thing if friend invit me again but i might tri to find a differ fri bread locat sinc the big guy behind the counter was so rude and condescend at this one  

prolli wont see ya therei was so disappoint by my lunch at sack today it remind me of a place in albuquerqu call baggin but they fell way short on custom servic and qualiti 

while the patio was pretti full there was no line and i was abl to walk right up to the counter to order no greet she took my order no explan although i prompt by say this is my first time here counterwork just stare blank until i ask so do i wait here or do you call my name 

the sandwich was fine egg salad cream chees and bacon on multigrain bread not the best ive ever had i ate half then turn to the bite size cooki as my reward it was hard as a rock i didnt even finish the shard that i bit off 

i dont see ani real reason to go backoh my i truli hate to do this but my visit to da vang was horrid after read all the love review i was so excit to take my husband and child to a place near our new dig to prove that we hadnt move far away from good food experi we knew that the outsid was a strip mall local we dont care we knew the insid was go to look like it did we dont care we go to place becaus of food servic and price 

when we went they were work on the one entranc so we enter on the far side there were two peopl eat and a few children run about play my first thought was great this is a friend famili place and light crowd would mean attent servic we didnt know if we should seat ourselv so we walk to the silverwar tabl where we saw menus and stood for a moment  three time server walk right past us and ignor our presenc other worker were in the kitchen area but no one notic us 

i whisper mayb we should get menus and just sit down so we took three menus and as i turn around one of the server came up and made motion for us to sit right there at this huge circl tabl  a veri larg tabl but we slid into the corner and he took drink order from us then dissappeared

w sat we sat some more he walk by twice carri water anoth server walk by twice onc with food onc with dish they greet two more tabl and brought them menus and took their order a server came and pour three water glass for our tabl and i interrupt him ask about our drink order he said someth i didnt understand and turn away  we sat 

final i said excus me pleas i got the attent of a differ server and we ask about our drink order which he took again and we didnt want to wait ani longer and gave our food order as well just in case theyd never come back i told the server we were new to this cuisin and would need some help my husband just want to leav i coerc him to stay it go to be fabul pho i said rememb the wonder yelp review the food would sooth him i smile smug we order sever dish all recommend in yelp review spring roll two phos and the ban xeo for my egg and shrimp love child

15 minut later two drink and some plate of leav and garnish were place on the tabl no drink for me and no way to get the garnish plate person attent we sat are we suppos to eat these ask my husband  i said  i believ they go in the soup when it come but after anoth 15 minut of noth els arriv he start to make a mini salad sever more tabl had come in everyon els had their food the two tabl who came after us were finish up

thi is bullshit  i mutter to my husband and just then the crepe and the phos came out i was start to see a trend here just when you get to the point where you want to leav they final do someth to make you stay we were starv and we didnt want to drive around for anoth place just eat and go at this point it was get late i hadnt eaten my garnish so i share them with my husband my daughter crepe was extra crispi border on too dark and she didnt know how to eat it so she sort of pluck the littl shrimp she found out of it  it not egg mom she said all grumbl it vietmanes egg i said  as if i knew  
well then i dont like vietmanes food sigh mayb she would like and tri the spring roll or some of my soup the sping roll one nibbl she didnt appreci it which was ok with me becuas i love themmi husband pho was full of fatti gristl meat and he wcouldnt eat ani of it  my pho was wonder my garnish made it veri tasti 

so i fed my daughter some pho but she wasnt too fond of that either

th onli real consol was the price it cost about 25 for everyth we got and everyth we didnt

mayb i can get someon from yelp who love da vang to come with us next time and show us how the experi is suppos to be becuas i cant imagin this is what peopl are rave over sorri they get two star for have a low price and food i like but i cant give them ani more than thatyou will find countri boy restaur at the intersect of camelback i17 and school cafeteria food rd

they violat my 3bs of diner safeti  the breakfast food was ok i didnt have a blt but my wife burger wasnot ok  as soon as i saw that bad boy i recogn the perfect preform round and the unusu textur that say cafeteria burger

but i wait for her reaction  i tast my side of home fri with onion and my singl pancak  the home fri were fine slight underdon but fine  the pancak was also fine  a tad sproingi but fine  

how your food

th fri are good

and the burger

it a littl off  prefab and the flavor and textur are familiar but from a long time ago  i cant place it

school cafeteria perhaps

that it  exactone night dure my visit to arizona i was extrem hungri and crave sushi dine at tradit sushi restaur was not an option  i search all over town for ayc sushi and sushi q was the onli restaur that yelp return within chandler mesa temp phoenix and scottsdal i jump into my car and quick roar out to sushi q at around 700pm sushi q is locat in a strip mall next to a seedi liquor store when i arriv dure happi hour there were onli 3 peopl in the restaur there no need to beat the dinner rush here 

i sat at the bar and design myself as an ayc custom after perus the order menu i was upset to discov an 8 order limit on the nigiri 8 order  16 piec when i eat ayc sushi in california i typic averag 50 piec with a person record of 64 nobodi care how much you order in california as long as you dont throw up on premis appar not the case in stingi arizona

th nigiri menu is spars with limit to the basic fish uni was not an option on the menu neither were ani premium fish not even off the ayc menu i order the standard choic albacor mackerel red snapper tuna salmon shrimp scallop and yellowtail the rice was serv at room temperatur as it should be the fish qualiti of the tuna salmon and red snapper was accept but the present for the other sushi was poor excess ponzu sauc and green onion were appli on top of the yellowtail mackerel and albacor to the point where i could not tast the distinct flavor of each fish see photo for the sloppi prepar and the overus of onion the qualiti was disappoint even for a korean sushi chef

for econom purpos sushi q expect ayc custom to fill up on appet and roll rather than the fish i fear leav with a half full stomach so i order roll and appet after the nigiri roll do not have order limit but premium roll were strateg remov from the ayc menu i ask for the negi salmon roll yellowtail roll and rainbol roll the roll were handl by a hispan sushi chef the rainbow roll was standard although the rice was a bit stiff yellowtail roll was a salti disast with excess garlicchili sauc drench over the fish that spread to the rice fortun the negi salmon roll was accept with minim sauc use and generous amount of salmon in each piece
 
be awar that appet are full order i order agedashi tofu expect just a few piec of hot tofu instead i receiv a basket full of fri tofu enough to feed a famili of 3 the agedashi tofu was a joke it was suppos to be serv in a broth with katsuobushi japanes onion some rice wine and soy sauc but all that was given was a bowl of soy sauc separ from the tofu

in the end i left with a full stomach but was dissatisfi with the qualiti of food consum i came to eat sushi but was instead instruct to order mediocr roll engulf in puddl of assort sauc the 16 piec limit is a sever limit that render the ayc option as not costeffect 2395 for dinneropen letter to busi owner everywhere

watch out  your dream is in jeopardi  

all that youd hope for all that youv work for is reliant upon one key factor over which you have onli scant control  you somehow need to get your hour wage employe to either believ in your same mission or at least be abl to fake it for the paycheck  how you do that is part of your undertak as a small biz owner but you simpli must figur out a way to do it

it just wont do to have a super origin idea with great potenti such as the delight sound steakenburg idea ruin by careless execut such as the iron twist of have the shave ribey steak portion of the conglomer overcook and overseason ie burnt and salti while the ground chuck portion is bare even cook to a state of rare  shouldnt it have been the other way around  well done ground meat and rare steak  at least  for foodsafeti sake

a wonder thing like freshcut fri with seasalt look good on paper or the menu board  howev it a menu item that tough to execut well and a soggi greasi pile of limp tuber did not look so good on my plate nor tast like much more than a soggi greasi pile of limp tubers

busi owner i know you cant be everywher at onc so asid from stand behind them watch at everi moment there must be a way to instil in employe some portion of the excit you feel about share your idea with the world
if you cant inspir a littl bit of this qualiti in them they wont instil enough qualiti in your food no matter how creativ and thought the menurecip was formed

sad mani wonder dream have end when the owner get a rude wakeup call that their brainchild wasnt nurtur attent enoughwhi no matter if you eat there or get it togo the burger are never warm i am not a fan of the sonic i hope this never happen to you let my stori be a warn alway check befor you scoot at the waffl hous and alway keep a bottl of hand sanit in your car for emerg  ugh i shutter just remembering

th patron of the waffl hous consist of drunk latenight night labor denni reject and the homeless  i be of the drunk varieti tend to wander in for a waffl in the wee hour of the morn when im not in the mood for a grand slam or a monster taco if you know what im say  usual i get the compani of some color peopl and a belli full of waffl but one night i got a littl more  my friend and i decid to grab a booth near the window and as i slid onto the bench my hand touch someth wet  i immedi pull it back expect to find food on the seat  when i look down at my hand it wasnt ani sort of waffl excrement between my finger it was human excrement a big ol loogi  yes someon spat on the seat and not just a littl i couldnt creat that monster with an upper respiratori infection

i just want the culprit to know i hate you  

as for the food you will enjoy it if you are drunk hungri and your hand havent been soil so that you can actual eat it  yummiokay so hard to believ i am the ftr of this garcia locat sinc it has been here for eon and look like it and is still one of the stapl restaur around the metro center area that hasnt close down or chang 

the food is the same as it has been for the last 15 year decent not great and sad the shred beef in the taco i had tast like it was boil without ani flavor or season 

for those of you read this review who have never been to phoenix arizona at all in fact you may not be awar of the greasi delici call a chees crisp this is serious where it is at pretti much all over the valley garcia doe make a fine chees crisp and for that i am still grate and will to go 

the one good thing i can say is the restaur still seem to have a hop bar area with live music a few night a week good for the happi hour crowd but sinc i was there with my mom and a cousin for lunch it didnt do anyth for me know this 

word of warn to ladi who need to potti while in the restaur areath bathroom is as old as the rest of the place one toilet so if you drink a lot be prepar to wait your turnit is funni how thing work i took my 12 year old here to eat becaus she want chines boofay i decid to look at uncl ryan cs review becaus he know cheap boofay this one was the highest rate and closest to the hous so how bad could it be in fact he had lunch here the veri same day 

locat 1 star this strip mall suck there were guy smoke 2 ft from the door the build is ugtggtlgti stuff fall off the overhang bad paint i almost got ran over walk out to my car sketchi patron etc 

interior 1 star this place was a carrow at one time i am sure of it when is the last time you saw a carrow in phoenix yep the decor is that old as mention they recent paint and hung blind i could not imagin this place befor 

servic 3 star veri nice attent and not intrus 

food 2 star at best the food was just there noth stood out noth was horribl i sampl almost everyth there except the seafood i had made a deal with my colon year ago to stop eat buffet seafood 

ice cream machin 1 star would have rather had ice chip 

i doubt i would be back there are plenti of other cheap place that have higher qualiti nicer ambianc and closer to my housi move veri near this restaur about a year and a half ago  the first time we tri it we love it enough to keep go back sever time  the food was delici and origin  not what you get at a typic generic american mexican restaur  
the place has realli gone down hill a lot in a short time
th latest time we went will also probabl be the last time we go  the food simpli stank  everyth came with a pile of hard purpl cabbag which unlik the typic but use pile of lettucetomato was noth more than garnish  this cabbag can be seen in just about all of the photo other have post  dish that had been consist good over sever visit were sudden chang and not for the better  

mi daughter shrimp tostada thing was a portion size almost half of what it use to be and if shes go to order someth that cost more than what i order itd better be worth it dammit

i know parrilla suiza has long been consid agreat place and not your typic mexican restaur but it just isnt the case anymor  

i am curious if ani other former longtim custom are recent feel the sameive been to this la parrila suiza a coupl of time now i keep get invit by some friend to join them in this mexico citi food fest  they love this place so ive hesit in write this review but after our last meal i feel i must spill the beans

servic  they are realli friend and help when order but they are veri slow i mean come on  you can onli play eye spi so mani time befor you loos interest in whi your there to begin with  the onli and i mean onli reason we did not leav was due to their trisalsa dippag action with crispi chip  it is realli one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creami kinda of dip

food  chicken flauta were ok three of them fri top with sour cream and piquillo sauc serv with rice guacamol cole slaw and bean the cole slaw and bean were not goo at all  

we also had the chicken melt which was veri good but we were short one of the tortilla  it was suppos to be two flour tortilla fill with melt chees chicken bacon avocado and tomato top with chees and a sauc it also came with their bean rice and cole slaw  it took so long to get our order we didnt bother say anything

our last order was a chicken taco salad  it was huge and serv in a veri crisp tortilla bowl  the salad was toss with all of the ingredi which was differ  i enjoy separ some of the chicken chees and other goodi in the salad bowl but with this salad you could not do that  it was all toss togeth  the chicken was veri cold and tast blah the bland dress was also toss into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushi lettuc yukaroo

so if your meet a friend and they are buy this might be a good place for you to goi think your either a fan of lenni or not a fan  i cant seem to understand what the fan are tast when they eat at this place  

i went to this lenni again last week for lunch and and had there singl chees burger with a side of fri and drink  the burger was overcook and tast like someth you would get a burger stand on a street corner the top were ok but my bun was smoosh sinc it was on the bottom of the bag  the fri were plain possibl prefrozen  i tri their mexican burger on my prior visit base on some yelp review and it wasnt much better than last week burger  

bottom line im not a fan yet but it beat go to the chain fast food place sinc there is not mani place to go in this area

btw  i find it veri hard to believ the burger in the cover photo was taken at lenni there no wayi wish i had talk zoe into siu wok
ugh  ok this place is cheap  that alway a plus  we want takeout from the buffet  you get a card kinda like at chino bandito and mark what you want from the buffet  hostess take card to the buffet and fill your takeout box  ok here is where she actual get star  my box was full  overload  alway a plus as chines takeout is alway good the next day  lo mein sesam chicken egg roll she gave me 2 beef with broccoli some shrimp thing and bbq pork rib  
818 with tax for what has turn out so far to be 4 meal  there is a complet lack of flavor for most of the dish  the onli one that actual had flavor was the rib  the rest  meh  i never use meh but in this case it works
ther was onli one packet of soy sauc in the bag  no sweet and sour for my egg roll  the lo mein  no flavor  shrimp thing  actual had shrimp in it but still no flavor
im a bit piss becaus i had a real crave for chines food  what i realli got was grandma make chines that gramp could eat without feel it the next day
m im not feel this place at all  
the onli thing that got them star was the size of the takeout portion and the price  
mehactual the 399 pizza from pizza patron look pretti darn good when i open the box it was hot but i notic immedi no pizza aroma adequ amount of pepperoni and chees and the crust look good too but had absolut no flavornon like a generic pizzaposs imit chees pepperoni sauc and dough i sprinkl copious amount of garlic saltpowd and crush red pepper all over it to give it some flavor i guess if you dont mind do that it worth 399 prob better to go across the street to littl caesar for 499 the star is for me and my season addit haha could give anoth star for conveni but park is badstop in here today with mike c to give this place a tri  i start to order a 14 combo which appear to come with a chile relleno  a burrito but when i ask what my meat choic were for the burrito i learn that no this is just two chile relleno wrap up in a tortilla to make a burrito  huh¿  no thank  so i order a 2 combo instead which was a chile relleno with a shred beef enchilada plus bean  rice

chip  salsa were serv too but the salsa was just a littl bit of two differ kind in littl caraf plus small bowl to pour it into  mike  i both prefer the green salsa but there was nowher enough for two peopl  the basket of chip so i ask for some more but never got it

th food was ok but the pablano chile the relleno was made with was so mild it amount to tasteless  the servic was just rock bottom from start to finish

thi combo cost 899  you get a better lunch overal across the street at best wok buffet for less than half that so  mehyep anoth chain and though i have eaten at mani og over the year have never been a huge fan 

had lunch here on a thursday with gma mom and daughter toward the late side of the lunch hour for some reason there was a wait and the dine room was crowd 

long stori short 2 of us return our meal as they were nasti breadstick and salad are still good but unfil ice tea weird servic etc make this one chain we will never visit again while in the areathe owner man was veri friendly

som chines woman the owner wifenot friend she gave me the impress that i was bother her for come in to eat there there were like 3 or 4 other tabl in the whole place

th food not so greatth chicken was most small almost chop chicken chunksdri too mayb from overcooking

flavor ick i didnt care for the food thought it was bland

beef dish not much beefmost veggi vs the meat ratio895 not a good value

i said thankyou as i leftth chines woman look at me and said noth then she walk awaynice

park is convenient

with the unfriend chines woman and not so great food there are mani other chines restaur that i would select over wongthis was my favorit dive bar back when i thought a dive bar had to be absolut rank i recent return a few time after year of have been away and realiz whi i had stay away so long 

the servic vari depend who your server is the beer is aw just a shitti select realli ef shitti i seem to rememb their buffalo chicken strip be delici but i must have been drunk out of my goddamn gourd they were dri and had almost no sauc oh and dont listen to what anyon may tell youlandshark is not tasti beer

i also rememb whi this is the onli bar i have been kick out of for get into alterc almost all of the patron were ass hat speak total doucheri and make me sick to my stomach as they use their smooth line on the waitress such as whi dont you want to go home with my friend he is hung like a hors har har har

nev have i been to a bar with so mani children seat at the booth you have a babyat a bar

ok so whi two star nathan you may be ask yourself  you seem to be realli get rile up about this place whi not give it one

th jalepeno chees steak sandwich is sooo ef good dirti real dive bar foodsooo good go dure the day when no one is there and do not drink the land sharkit is not tasti beerown by the same parent compani as old countri and much of the same food but just not as good or should i say not as mediocre

thi locat is close to my job and they give a 20 discount if i show my badg so i end up here sometim even though it not so great

th food readi to grab and eat so that work well for lunch hour

th dig are show their age and wear and tear but most of the busser seem to keep thing tidi up as they tri to earn a tip from you even though they dont even get you drink anymore

pretti much everyth here use to be better a few year ago  the last sever visit ive encount thing like wilt spinach one visit onli to have my complaint remedi by no spinach on the next coupl visit  that what i get for be picki i guess

your lunch here will consist of such delicaci as chees enchilada chees pizza macaroni  chees fri chicken mash potato green bean corn bread spaghetti chicken dumpl soup jello and an icebergromain lettuc mix and a few other thing  
tsabout it
day in and day out with an occaision teriyaki chicken  white rice or gradeschoolcafeteriagrad meat patti on dri bun or someth like that thrown in to keep you on your toes

they use to offer both ice cream and yogurt in soft serv machin but usual it onli one or neither  just like the main cours and side the dessert select just isnt what it use to be

th creme brule and prime rib must be held back until the weekend when they charg that 2 morei recent had drink and food with friend here the servic was aw it took over 40 minut to get my 2nd drink in addit they forgot two food order when i spoke with the manag he offer to take the item off my bill i told him i will pay for the item i got i was so frustrat becaus i just want him to listen to my complaint and he onli kept throw out excusi was in the mood for chines food and this place was on my radar  i realli want to like this place but it fail in almost everi aspect  this is my first two star review as i give almost everi restaur the benefit of the doubt and acknowledg that they must be do someth right to stay in business

upon wake in i didnt know if i should seat myself or wait to be seat  no one approach me immedi but i patient wait for someon to greet me and be seat  i realli should have turn around at that moment but decid to give it a shot  

i order a meal that came with a soupyslurpeesludgi egg drop soup soggi cream puff decent egg roll bore brown rice and flavorless kung pao entre  realli was some of the worst chines food ive ever had

dur my meal i notic the server were unprofessionali loung at a tabl that had a bag of half eaten dorito  text on their phone and not pay attent to the custom  the place is dirti and has clutter near the kitchen  my advic is to clean up a littl of that clutter and shut the door to the not so nice look kitchen  

im sad to have to write such a poor review but im onli state the fact  i may be back but it will be quit some time befor i decid sosad this place did not realli live up the the review we went there for lunch last weekend i had the club mayb the most accur thing i can say about it is that it was just like someth i would make myself at home dure the week to take to work for lunch that not realli what im expect when i pay 8 for a sandwich the cooki that came with the meal was good if a bit hard no paradis bakeri cooki and the frozen yogurt was good as well

th decor was nice and the servic was good some of the other desert look real good

unfortun when i spend 20 on sandwich i expect someth worth that not the same thing id get in my own kitchen for a few buckgood 1 cookies

servic is not so good ignor custom busi chat with peopl instead of help customwas look for a breakfast place so we decid to stop at grandma kitchen the atmospher was soso they should have had music on or someth the waitress wasnt mean or rude just kinda sur i order the bacon spinach and mushroom omelett minus the shroom when i got the omelett i notic the spinach didnt look veri fresh and upon first bite i could tast it can spinach ew im assum the mushroom would have been can too glad i left them offi could just copi  past tim js review of this place from a year  a half ago  it would be real close but let me do my own goodnot so good account

th good

  it nice insid  i was abl to plant myself in a comfort booth for lunch  norm r join me to run this place up against one of the valley best of these kind of place pizza buffet  much much more in north phoenix  i also kept pizza hut buffet 48th st amaz jake cici pepé  peter piper in mind in review it

  the salad bar is ok have enough of the usual veggi to satisfi  there were potato  macaroni salad that were ok

  disregard greas the flavor of the pizza was pretti good

  our server an older ladi who look like shed be more at home at the great scott generat was friend  attentive

ok let get to the dirt

  they have rule  have you ever been to new town super buffet in burbank ca  2099 extra charg if you eat the fish off the sushi  dont eat all the rice  2099 extra charg if you dont eat all the food on your plate  2099 extra charg if you take a plate of ani one thing  ok it wasnt quit as bad as that but it was in so mani word no you cant come over to this side of the serv tabl where it more conveni to get your pizza that in the back  no you cant get your own ice cream cone for dessert  you get the idea

then there was the pizza  there was some chees bread some garlic bread  sever pizza out  the pizza choic consist of chees chees with a dab of someth els pepperoni sausag  pepperoni  sausag  noth els realli except that you could special order taco pizza or can you imagin sauerkraut pizza  holi st  you thought spam lo mein was weird

ther was so much greas float around on the top of the pizza slice that you could roll one up from side to side aim it at your friend in this case norm r  squirt it out the bottom at them like milk a cow

  the coup de grâce to this place was the outrag price  i call ahead  they told me 850 includ soft drink  a softserv cone which is ridicul for a pizza buffet  then when i arriv here hungri  21 mile from home i was advis that they have just jack the price up to 925 for all adult  holi st again  even if the pizza wasnt all greasi the maximum price includ drink  noyoucantgetityourself soft serv ice cream cone should be 625  even then it wouldnt be as good overal as pizza buffet where the same amount of choic cost 499399 senior

two star periodmeh i was realli look forward to tri out takamatsu after all it is right up the street from our hous 

dude and i join sarah r and a larg group 1520 i think mani drop in and out here for her sendoff dinner

y the qualiti servic tend to declin when larger group are present but what we experienc was downright unacceptable

r rude server mumbl and spoke too quiet and we seem like a giant inconveni to her 

brought roll to our tabl that belong to no one in our parti and got visibl peev eye roll dirti look etc when one of us told her polit it wasnt ours

good luck get water or utensil dude and i end up just share a glass 

tri to cash out or get a check was a nightmar anoth server approach our parti and ask dude and i if some roll were our they need a better way to keep track of ticket 

got to the point we walk up to the cashier told him what we order and paid

also anoth server on sarah end of the tabl got frustrat with a new guest to our parti and rip up his sushi order sheet in front of custom  and was that realli necessari 

we probabl made a mistak order sushi at a korean bbq joint but hey sound tasti 

tri the las vega tiger rainbow and heart attack roll 

everyth tast the same way too much rice thin cut fish to the point it look like just the skin and the bread on the vega roll was breadi and soggi like it had been sit out a long time 

and dont even get me start on the culinari clusterphuk that was that heart attack roll come on eel sauc  spici chees sauc  cream chees  jalapeno pepper doe not equal a palat pleaser

i did howev get to tast a piec of sarah spici pork dish  that was excellent

th bright side to this place we had a wonder time enjoy the compani of our friend and takamatsu was ok with me bring a cake for sarah

despit the dismal experi i want to come back and tri the korean bbq 

that is until dude got an epic case of food poison go on day two and were talk about a guy that almost never get sick can count on one hand after near 9 year togeth how mani time hes been sick

not worth 895roll sure as hell wasnt worth an 18 gratuiti charg 

ill stick to shimogamo for delici sushi that match the price and will be on the hunt for anoth korean bbq place 

spare your digest tract and avoid the sushi stick to bbq if you gofirst time stop in for lunch

cut place beauti patio i sat insid though becaus it was veri windy

awesom hot chip and fresh salsa veri good

i order the pescado pescadose pic i guess i had overlook that the fish was fri in a corona beer batter veri overpow flavor i dont like beer at all so that pretti much ruin the taco for me the bean and rice were delici though certain not worth 14

mi husband got the chees enchiladasse pic they were also delici the sauc was just right he said the food could have been hotter temperatur wise

overal a nice place for ambianc especi on the patio the food was good except for the beer batter if you like beer though it might have work for you and i think their price are a bit greedy

it was as pretti a night as he could rememb out of a great plenti of such night  they stood on a rise of the pavement outsid of 98 south  dinner was over  she nudg a poignant finger outward  she motion to the age structur light by lantern manufactur to resembl someth much older  insid of them burn incandesc bulb instead of oil

          to the wineri  the girl said

          absolutely

          good  

they enter and notic the smell of cook meat  like roast lamb  hunger was not a press issu so they ignor the olfactori coax  a casket black book with a singl leaflet is present by a woman  they rifl through the wine select insid  

          what is it

          nothing

          see anyth you like

          noth is captur my interest

          mine either

          ill have the zinfandel i guess

          okay

          i think ill have the pinot  

          good   

they sit on the outdoor patio and notic the light dust of antiqu decor  neither is sure of it authenticity

          how is your wine

          it average

          mine too  

          actual i dont realli like it

          far too pepperi  i wouldnt recommend the zin

          tri it

          the girl drank it and hand it back

          drink some more

          you drink it

          okay finish your quick and let go

they sat in the patio and look out in the park lot and the breweri beyond and the festiv atmospher within  

           to the breweri  she said

           you mean it

            sure

they couldnt get out of the wineri quick enough as they wade the foot traffic and fourcylind car through the park lot as the night hum in futur mysteriyo ho yo ho a greasi life for me

pir fish ampersand chip was my first experi into the ever so popular uk fish ampersand chip lifestyl as a matter of fact i dont realli even enjoy seafood to begin withthat must be whi i like the food here the first time i visit it i went with my total cool yelper buddi fatso httpwwwyelpcomuserdetailsuseridtqo2dfe6o6lwalvawgccq and have been back a few time sinc our initi visit we actual have not visit the chandler establish we go to the gilbert one warner and gilbert rd area

th ambianc ok well ambianc is a bit of an excess word in this case but it is a room with window a place to sit to me this is by far the worst part about this place i honest feel like im sit in an er wait room wonder if im go to see a doctor in the next 4 hour the tabl are made of the same materi my kid littl tyke outdoor picnic tabl is made of and they feel veri grimi and in need of a serious power wash there is no pirat paraphernalia nor ani background music reminisc of the high sea the closest they come is when the 42 westinghous lcd is set to espn and they have a special on either the pittsburgh pirat or the tampa bay buccaneers

th staffservic i would probabl say that the the staff and servic are right around par but they are real close to drop to a quick bogey sorri got stuck on the espn refer there the wait time for your food onc you order it is probabl 4x longer than mcdonald howev the food seem a lot less complic to make there isnt an item on the menu that not drop into a fryer basket then remov after the timer sound im sure it just the amount of time that god requir a frozen hunk of sub zero seafood to thaw in boil hot greas but i want it faster for the most part the 2 employe that i have ever seen there are amiabl howev you dont want to ask too mani question or get into heavi convers that would most like prove hazard to your health as the wrong spoken word or impati glanc would most like push them over the edg of  complac to postal just smile and nod smile and nod 

the food sinc i didnt know what i would like decid to go with the phrase ill take one of everyth fortun they had a combo meal that gave you a nice sampl of all the differ fish type product not be a fan of seafood turn out to be a great thing at this restaur becaus i was serv a huge basket of sizzl hot french fri top with pound of batter dippedbatt i found out that somewher in the middl of the batter dip batter there was in fact a small portion of fish type product it kind of like eat a tootsi popexcept the other way aroundth batter is the best part as oppos to the crappi hard candi you have to get through to eat the tootsi roll 

the price the bright spot here is that the price is rather inexpens howev if you stop and think about what your eat it kind of make sens most everyth is frozen process and cover in batter everyth on the menu can be order as a meal with fri and a drink for around 5  6 if youd like to super size your meal you can actual throw in piec of fish shrimp scallop or crab a la cart to meet your stomach need 

all in all all in all i cannot figur out whi the hell i keep go back to pirat fish ampersand chip i hate the atmospher i dont care for the employe the tabl irrit the heck our of me and the food is unhealthi deep fri and cheap the food is unhealthi deep fri and cheap redrum redrum redrum the food is unhealthi deep fri and cheap the food is unhealthi deep fri and cheap  

oh yea that whyyumlong wait  order nutti pancak  spi neighbor greatlook omelett while wait for said pancak  tast the cake and wish id order the egg  pricey menu made my mediocr dish even more disappointing

felt out of place here with so mani welldress salonb tan peopl breakfast is my favorit time of the day and dine here brought my cheer mood down fastive never written a review befor but after my experi here i thought i would come and give my two cents

i suggest come here with my boyfriend and his friend for his birthday sinc we were on this side of town big mistak the hostess told us 25 minut and we end up wait closer to 45 minut when our friend ask about the long wait they assur us that the 7 tabl in front of us would be seat if we wait just 10 minut more i wish they wouldv just over estim the time so we would be prepar for a long wait 

i have never been more embarrass in my life to suggest a place when the hostess seat us at a wet tabl and threw the menus down and walk away after seat us after that it didnt matter how hip or delici the food was i am never go back hereuhhh i think my neighbor is on crack  he said julio gs is the bestblah blah blahth food is so goodblah blah blah  when he should have said dude stay the hell away from julio gs their steak ef tast like cardboard

id give it 1 star but i reserv that for restaur that have except bad servic as well as food jgs had decent servic aw food

i cant think of a singl good reason to go to julio gsthis place has piss me off for the last time  well probabl not the last time but it should be  ive not been a regular becaus the food is so incred awesom it just okay  ive been a regular becaus of the locat and the reliabl good servic  that seem to all chang onc smoke was ban in the bar  

they are now eager to sit you in the bar as much as they can especi if you come dure a slow period  i dont have a problem with that except the servic realli suck in the bar  weve given them sever chanc and it alway the same  last night after brave the flood water we left befor we ever saw drink as the onli server in the area was too busi chat it up at the bar to ever come over  but on a posit note the hostess who seat us thank us for come in  shes an observ onedid i miss the crappi serviceattitud memo

i start out in a such a good mood

bi 1230 id alreadi been grind away on the gear of my life for almost 8 hoursinclud the sporti littl run along the canal this morningi need a retox

i decid to head through the park to get to lunch today becausewellit a beauti day and it a beauti parkmayb get a gelato after lunch for my sweet treat

sad i was in a signific less good mood when i got to got for my sweet treat after a pedestriancar alterc and a poor serv and unfortun lunchin fact you could say i had shift to cranky

got door was lock not the first time this happen when they are suppos open and the woman behind the counter was yell to me through the window to come back in 30 minutesat lunch houron a warm spring afternoonreally

i mouth what at her and cup my hand to my ear like i didnt understand so she repeat herselfand i said what again and then tire of my littl game i left with a wave that said i will be take my gelato busi to gspot for the forese future

im write a memo that no one will read about all of this as we speakim sorri bravo bistro i want to soooo bad to like your restaur  let start by say if you put on your websit ask your server about our happi hour then you probabl should let your server know  our server brought us the wine list all bottl north of 40 and didnt mention or offer wine by the glass  when i ask him about happi hour his respons  it onli until 7 which it was 620pm and if you order one minut past i will charg you full price but you can sit at the bar and get hh all night then took the wine list and walk away  so you dont want us to sit at your tabl we stay at the tabl and order our wine by the glass like the second class citizen that we were at least that how we were treat some bruchetta and an order of garlic bread for the meal  they brought us a complimentari plate of hummus which was good but on the salti side as was everyth we were served

when it came time to order i ask about vegetarian option he said they could do ani combin of pasta and sauc primavera style  i order penn with spici marinara primavera  it came out with less than a cup of pasta and no veggi  when the server final came by to check on our meal which i hadnt tri i told him i didnt get ani veggi he look annoy and took it back to the kitchen   im sorri but i was not too thrill about pay 15 for a cup of pasta with no veggi no salad and no bread when my food came back the portion size had slight increas it was good but noth special and there was no spice whatsoev  my boyfriend order the chicken parmesan and said it was a littl salti which ive never heard him say in two year becaus he over salt everyth  overal the menu was limit the servic was uninvit and it was overpr for the qualiti and atmospher  we will not be backmy experi at bravo bistro was veri disappoint after look at the websit and read other review i went there expect to be wow by the wine select and the mediterranean cuisin neither  were great  my first impress of the wine list was one of dismay it seem that it had not been updat in some time the first three bottl that i inquir about were unavail and the server had to go upstair to check on the fourth onli to return with bad news decid that we would stick with wine by the glass my wife ask what pinot noir was avail the server had to go behind the bar to see what she could come up with and return with a bottl of castl rock this gem is 6 a bottl at your local super market she pass on the pinot and was then offer a glass of anoth red wow what a wine list inde 

mi experi was complet ruin though when i order the veal ossobuco onli to be told that it too was unavail at this point i was veri frustrat and cop an attitud ask well what do you have
th server apolog and offer the lasagna instead she said it was a hous specialti and that everyon rave about it i got the lasagna and while it was good it was noth that i couldnt have gotten at the oliv garden down the street 

bottom line is that this place doesnt live up to it reput814
went for dinner  want to dine insid as it was still veri warm outsid but the nois level there was ridicul and it wasnt even halfful so i ask for patios  servic from my server was veri spotti i onli saw her when she took my order the return visit to see if i need anyth and at the end when i ask for the bill  it took more than 15 minut to get the bill and when she did arriv with it i paid w a giftcard the credit balanc was miss on the receipt so i had to wait anoth ten minut befor final go in myself to look for her

had the vegetariana pizza which came with mozz provolon parmigiano reggiano caramel onion and roast red pepper 13  still lovin the crispi thincrust  howev it seem like the pizzaiolo took a light hand with the veget and chees  i consum all but one slice worth of top and all the crispi bit of crust my hand could find in the veri lowlight surround i apolog for the dark photo and i didnt even feel guilti afterward  as i said i rare saw my femal server and most of my interact were with the busser who brought ice water to me after i had been sit outsid for about 15 minut with my pizza order alreadi place 5 minut ago a candl when it becam too dark to see and tabl bread when i ask for it  

three star for the tasti pizza even with such littl top  had to dock a star bec of the cheesi pun intend servic from the femal servermy origin review was written just over a year ago so when i was invit to a babi shower here today i was hope i would have a better experi 

ill start by say i ad one star becaus it realli is just a love place it too bad the food is so averag and that be generous 

i got an ice teaso over brew and way too strong almost bitter 

i order the pesto grill shrimp salad see pic marin and grill shrimp babi lettuc dice avocado babi tomato goat chees grill corn and lime vinaigrett top with frizzl tortilla sound delici no 

no is right serious the vinaigrett was all oil no lime or acid at all there wasnt enough of anyth on the salad to get a good bite of all the flavor bland as they were and the fri tortilla strip were old and veri greasi realli a 14 salad should be noth less than divin 

mi daughter got the albacor tuna salad sandwich see pic 12 
albacor tuna pecan jicama scallion cucumb and purpl cabbag on sunflow  whole wheat bread with potato salad 

again sound delici but was less than stellar 

the tuna mixtur had a decent flavor but the tuna wasnt even mix thorough it was in larg chunk straight from the can 

the potato salad potato were barley done almost crunchi and lack ani flavor that would make me want to continu eat near raw potato 

the atmospher isnt enough to intox my sens into believ im eat someth amaz how unfortun that so mani can be blind by a trend becaus the food is just not all thatthis place is like an outdoor garden at someon greataunt home in the hampton we were seat immedi at a wroughtiron tabl outsid under some mister and hand menus it was a good 10 minut befor our server came out to take our beverag order and the onli reason i stay that long was becaus my escort excus himself to take a phone call howev when our server did come by she was supernic my bee eff had two egg with bacon and i order some frenchiesound crepe dish with ham and gruyer chees with a creami bechamel sauce
anoth 10 minut goe by befor she drop off our ice tea and orang juic which are serv in those winelook water glass with the stem and theyr both suck down pretti fast and then weve got two empti glass on the tabl and no one ever come back to see if we need a refil at this point i am period check the time becaus hey it hot outsid and we have noth to drink and our server is seem nowher in sight sever minut pass befor she drop off a caraf of ice tea and some water anoth twenti minut and our food come out his is miss toast and mine look revolt but im realli into crepe and im pretti openmind about food so i dive in anoth five minut goe by befor he get his toast and is told that there is no tabasco sauc anywher in the build nor in the build across the street that server have had to run to in order to get thing that are obvious miss from the restaur it seem that the compani own both properti but youd think they would keep all of their restaur stuff in one conveni locat 
mi date food was eh no big deal egg and bacon you realli cant screw that up 
mi crepe were the best part of the dish they were the perfect consist thin no lump no weird fri edg i like the crepe howev i was under the impress that the fill was to be ham and gruyer and it was ham lunchmeat onli not what i was expect the crepe were swim in a wateri milki sauc that need salt or some other season not quit the creami bechamel i was expect and the gruyer was sprinkl across the top so visual if you can pictur this white cat vomit but i was starv at that point and i like the crepe part so i ate it 
and then i want to pay and leav and we couldnt even do that becaus like the entir experi thus far no server to be found dont get me wrong i didnt dislik her i mean when she did come around she was one of the nicest server ive ever had she was just inattent to her tabl on the front patio get the check took anoth fifteen and then i was readi to pay and it took so much longer wait for no one to come back that it got to the point where i had to get up go insid and stand in the kitchen while someon els rang me up 

bottom line mediocr overpr food 40 for two small breakfast and no booz shit servic not go backthe event seem as if pass in anoth lifetim yet simultan i recal it as if it were onli but a moment ago

clear as ever it haunt my reveri and dash my touristi vintag soda shop dream to smithereen noth more than ancient affect now turn to dust

what could possibl tarnish my fond childhood recollect of the sugar bowl

him he sat there idl fondl a morsel of someth sudden he was off advanc toward the counter at lightn speed straight toward my prize possess 

he approach it without hesit and befor i knew it a cockroach had crawl up my sundae

ti better to have love and lost than never to have love at all save for when you unknow love someth infest with cockroach then it becom debatwent to dinner with some friend we were celebr a friend presenc  she had move out of the valley almost 2 year ago we were a parti of 8  

this was my 1st time to los olivo and i was kind of excit to tri them out unfortun sometim be me requir you to attend more than one parti in a day so i just came from anoth parti where i had alreadi fill up on some food so i wasnt veri hungri but want to join my friend in the fun

i was about ten minut late ask the hostess were my friend were seat at and was told oh just look around till you find them we have a few parti here tonight  i thought well isnt that nice i get to roam in a place i dont know veri well but turn out i didnt have to go far i found them in the 2nd room

i sat down and was brows the menu our server came to me and said what are you drink and look a littl perturb that i join this tabl i just told her water i wasnt the last one to the parti my other friend show up 5 min after me and she got the same chilli attitud from the server and with a big parti like our it didnt realli matter how bad the servic was becaus the tip was alreadi ad to our bill 

everyon place there order i wound up order deep fri ice cream sinc i was alreadi a meal ahead of everyon while wait for our food i was munch on the chip and salsa now im not a fan of the salsa the hotter one was way to seedi for me i like hot salsa but i dont like fee like im eat sunflow seed and the mild salsa was like a pico de gallo minus ani pepper and runni i mix the 2 togeth and that didnt realli help either so eat chip and salsa wasnt work for me

now the deep fri ice cream that was perfect the sweet tast of honey the crispi outer shell and the cold ice cream made a perfect treat for this hot summer day

i realli want to like los olivo mayb ill go to the other locat and give them anoth trithe food is decent noth to realli go crazi about and not realli worth the price but it decent and close to work so that make it easy

th biggest issu i have is with the servic after multipl visit i have come to the conclus that the server and employe are friend but it take 15 hrs to have lunch and that wouldnt be a problem if i thought the food was spectacular enough to wait that long and our drink are almost alway empti and the server are hard to find 

ill most like continu eat here everi now and then bc it conveni and it easi to pleas everyon but i wouldnt realli go out of my way to go herehad our servic been anyth better than pathet bad buca would be a solid 3 star  so here the deal on the servic  i got a coupon in the mail for a free spaghetti with marinara  that what brought us in  but we also order two appet and an entre to start with  i comment that i thought the coupon was a nice idea to bring peopl in give away a littl spaghetti but sell twice that in other menu item  his respons was yeah if peopl are like you and order other stuff but if they just order spaghetti and water insert monoton robot voic  well okay then he should be grate we didnt do that

everyth we order was terribl slow to come  kitchen fault  mayb but we notic where the other server on the patio are come and go our server is rare seen and when he is around hes drag his feet appear to be on his way to the gas chamber  other than take and deliv our order he did noth for us  while not rude he was not pleasant or over friend either  the other guy on the patio help us out with drink refil clear plate etc  after a long wait at the end of the meal he return remark someon els was suppos to be help  we order dessert to go anoth terribl wait and ask our food be box  final he bring the dessert and realiz he never brought the leftov  off he shuffl  upon return he say hes sorri about the wait  not half as sorri as he would be upon see his tip im sure

a for the food it good but noth outstand  even for famili style plate i think it slight overpr  when they say a small serv 23 that 23 lunch size portion  if your a healthi eater count on 2  here what we ordered

smal garlic bread  realli good bread slather in fresh garlic but 799  yes it a good size basket but it still just garlic bread  perhap bread should be offer at no charge
  
small mozzarella capres  five nice thick slice of tomato with good qualiti chees and whole basil leav  999 but worth it

smal spaghetti with marinara normal 999 but free  i would say this serv two for a main dish three as a side  marinara was okay noth special

smal chicken parmigiana  tasti but overpr at 1799 for two breast imo  rememb it doe not come with ani pasta just the chicken

tiramisu  best valu at 995  it the size of a small pie and could easili serv four but i didnt think it was fantast  it a littl too wet like you could squeez the cake and get a cup of coffe out of it

w want to have a afterlunch drink but the servic turn us off to that  might come back might notthe second time i went back to this restaur was peculiar  the waitress start out clingi and constant compliment my friend then she becam veri pushi about want us to leav  she brought our check with 2 fortun cooki on top came back 2 minut later then toss the cooki onto the tabl and wiggl the check at us  i was will to write off this occas sinc my first was so good

i went back for a 3rd tri and actual had to walk out becaus the servic was so bad  

our group of 4 came in and said that we need a tabl for 4  the hostess show us to a tabl with onli 3 seat at it then look confus when we point out that we need anoth chair  she then show us to anoth tabl with 3 seat then start to walk away  when we got her attent to point out that 3 seat are never adequ for 4 peopl regardless which side of the room it is on she told us to go wait in line again  

technic there was no line but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either tabl  while we were wait for them to get their sht togeth i notic that the hostess was grab chair from all over the restaur and put it at a tabl that did not have all of their dine partner  im no restaur owner but it seem to me that it would be more import to seat peopl who are actual there  my blood was start to boil but we were seat and i was will to forgive

w had our menus and we were readi to order but we wait and wait  i think it was 15 minut befor the waitress the weird clingi one from my second trip came to our tabl we had no drink no noth  we realiz how much time we were wast and discuss get our food to go befor the waitress final appear at our tabl  when we mention get our food to go she gave us the nastiest look then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted

i lost it  i told the waitress that everyth that we had experienc thus far was complet unaccept and i wouldnt toler it  i stood up to leav and she stood where she was in my way ignor me and tri to take my dine companion order  she final back off without even a glimmer of apolog after my companion realiz that i realli was leav 

i will not go back here ever again no food is worth this treatmentworst tortilla soup i have ever it tast it was like a hot bowl of salsa plain and simpl if i would have been given chip i may have eaten it the server was realli cute and attent but she had no clue what to suggest for a non meat eater i was struggl to find anyth appeal here she final suggest a salad it was good it had candi walnut and dri cranberri w goat chees on it but by the time i got it everyon had eaten and i stole a bunch of their fri so i couldnt eat the whole colass salad i just read dalla review i wish the girl would have suggest their veg burger sad i might go back if i had to i use to live at zipp year ago but main for the footbal and booz not the food mehi cant even begin to say how mani poor custom servic experi i have had here

w use to do lunch a few time a week at my old job and zipp seem to be one of the regular spot although i alway made a fuss rather than be stuck in the offic and miss out on the lunch gossip i alway opt to go and everi time it was the same old storythi place is never too busi dure lunch but servic is slower than the second come it would take 15  2 hour for the small group of us to make it through lunch not to mention that after consum my first beverag the glass would remain empti my number one dine pet peev 

i do have to say that i cant complet hate on zipp becaus their food realli is good they have awesom nacho and sandwhich i have never been disappoint with the qualiti of my food and when i was have a calori splurg day zipp pizooki was the perfect way to do it 

zipp get a 2 star rate from me but if they get their servic act togeth we can negoti a better scorecame here on christma eve becaus of all the hype the price is an upsal restaur but the food is mediocr and the atmospher is like a musti old sport bar i didnt think anyth was great about the place remind me of a cafeteria there are far better restaur in the valley for the pricewe went on friday night to don and char with some friend  we didnt have a reserv so the wait was quit long which realli wasent a big deal becaus i knew the wait would be long

th owner saw that we we had been wait so he found a tabl for us
th problem was the waitress was quit busi and when we order our food she assum that we would be share so she had everyth split  we ask numer time for ketchup and she kept forget  
the biggest problem i had was that i order rib  they were so dri that i had to pour lot of sauc over them  earlier that night the asu footbal team was there i think they cook a ton of rib and had extra that they didnt use so then they serv those to us  they were the worst rib i have ever had

i do love the decor and mayb the food would be better at anoth timetook my daughter caus i had a groupon  i had the bbq rib and my daughter had the prime rib   i cant say the rib were anyth spectacular  in fact it tast quit ho hum and there was bare ani meat on the bone  my daughter prime rib was anyth but great  no au jus and the creami horseradish had waaaayyyi too much cream and bare ani horseradish   the bus boy was tri to wisk our dish away befor my daughter was even done eat  was that a hint that there were more pay custom out there and they need our tabl  he came back two more time tri to take away our dish befor we were done  someon need to teach the busser how to bus  have save 20 by use the groupon and spend over 70 not worth it at allwas excit to tri this place sinc i saw from their websit that it had ton of sport memorobilia and that the owner was from chicago where we are from  and it was within walk distanc too

walk over there for dinner  it was of cours ridicul crowd  problem 1  the hostess was complet clueless and overwhelm  we ask how long the wait would be she said she was unsur  we ask if we could put our name in she again said she didnt know  in the meantim theyr call other parti name for seat so we ask again  the hostess get a confus look on her face and ignor us  so we just sat ourselv in the bar dine area 

fifteen minut later a server decid to come over and ask us if wed been help  she take our drink order  two other server come by and ask if we would like to order drink and we tell them wed alreadi had our drink order taken  throughout the cours of our meal i think four server serv us  no clue who our actual server was  

i think this was in part becaus there was an asu sport group head coach in the restaur sit a few tabl over  it was amus to watch the cheesebal of an owner spend the whole even namedrop and schmooz with them  too bad it was at the expens of the other custom  

the food we order was actual good  kind of surpris that the burger didnt come with fri especi for over 10  after we were done eat it liter took almost a half hour for us to get our bill  one of our four server actual caught on and brought a bill and apolog for the sketchi servic but assum we understood sinc the tabl behind us was more import  it is the new asu head coach you know  

we admir the memorobila collect as we walk out listen to the owner do some more namedrop about how he knew bud selig in the lobbi and left  despit the good food and impress sport collect we probabl wont be back  too bad  was hope for betteri would like to have eaten here but they didnt seem to want to serv us  it was a monday even and the restaur was onli 13 full  we were seat for 15 minut without anyon acknowledg us  we even tri to flag down the hostess to find out where our waiter was and she kept walk by 

the music was a littl too loud  and the interior was predictable

i am give 2 star bc i have been to anoth ra locat and like their sushicalamari overcook 2 order of veal overcook drunk guy walk around the entir meal scream pricelesslast night 6 of my girlfriend and i had dinner here we had made reserv and were seat prompt we were howev seat next to the door and one of my girlfriend was shove a few time by other custom becaus of it we all shrug it off and tri to enjoy our night

first off the 2 star are for the food the food was pretti amaz i had the chilean sea bass and it was divin it was serv on top of fresh made ravioli and it was incred everyon els had veri posit thing to say about their dinner for dessert we all share 3 cannoli which tast heaven so delicious

her is where it take a turn for the worse

our bill arriv and we know that they dont do separ check understand we were told we could split it up with our card as long as we told them how much to charg fast forward 2 minutesa im simpli write down how much to charg on each card a older look bald man approach our tabl and start mumbl about need our tabl and that we have been take too long are you kid me from start to end we were there a maximum of 1 hour a parti of 7 mind you he then proceed to come back and again state that we are take forev with the card and what is it go to take to get us out of there i understand that it a saturday night but the manner in which he address us was complet unaccept and unprofession it was flat out rude and demean 

at first i thought mayb he was just have a bad night and whatnot but after read other review i know that is just his wonder person i would love to come back for the food but am not go to support a busi that is spearhead by such a jerkwe had a mediocr dinner tonight i have been here befor but after tonight we wont be return the salad was just ok lettuc with a ton of blue chees dress that tast like sour cream the entre of halibut was good the waiter appar didnt like the tip our host gave him he came back and ask if the servic was ok then whisper someth rude in our host ear as we were exit the tabl made a big deal of say you cant believ this tabl to one of his cowork then follow my 84 year old mom and i and told us he onli got a 10 tip tip are discretionari for one thing and we had no control over that classless if you want real italian food serv by polit peopl in a relax atmospher go to tommi vs and forget this place225 star round down  like when your pencil need sharpen and it not much more than a nubbin  round down  2 pencil  

food was servic no more  nickel and dime go on too

ther was some heavi duti karaok action go on in the bar  doe the word wail mean anyth to you  if it doe do it with pride

atmospher with insideoutsid seat is ok  plenti of mister as well as plenti of mrsmy father friend recommend bandera as a dine locat dure our famili pilgrimag to scottsdal it a popular restaur  when we call up at 500pm to make a sameday reserv the earliest avail tabl was at 915pm we decid to wait for a tabl instead and were seat in about 45 minutes

a quick perus of the menu told me that it was a hillstoneown restaur there the macho salad a butternut and cheddar enchilada homemad oreo sandwich etc this was a bit disappoint as ive dine at a coupl of hillston elsewher and was hope for a more origin dine experi but sinc we were there we ordered

gril artichok httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbanderascottsdaleselecteniidlsw7sior6yof2saqnxgmm9ulq9driyjssjffmw 45 who doesnt love a nicelygril veget this was nice and crispi on the outsid soft and tender on the insid and serv with a good remoulad dip they serv this at everi houston and is an appet ill alway order

skillet cornbread httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbanderascottsdaleselecteniidlsw7sior6yof2saqsd27yfmbnr2nfa0p4fy2og 255 anoth houston stapl there is much less cornmeal in this than in most version of cornbread and it quit heavi on the butter this combin make for a heavi noncakey cornbread which i actual prefer but will leav traditionalist a bit disappoint youll find corn kernel and jalapeno bake into it

crispi chicken sandwich httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbanderascottsdaleselecteniidlsw7sior6yof2saqp25rqphnyaxrdxqu8feqxq 155 i had this at honor bar in bever hill and love it unfortun this was quit disappoint the chicken breast was flavorless in addit to be fri too long so that the overlycrispi batter was fall off there wasnt enough moistur in the sandwich overal to combat a heavytast bread the kale slaw was realli lack in vinaigrett and there was none of the delici honey aioli i rememb from the previous time i order this dish it didnt get finished

banderastyl roast chicken httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbanderascottsdaleselecteniidlsw7sior6yof2saqcc7heytw61mgjijsojzusq 255 i guess there onli so much you can do with rotisseri chicken but this wasnt a huge step up from what you can get at el pollo loco for far cheaper while the 12 chicken was moister it was prepar with the same paprika and onion powder rub the accompani rice look fantast but was ultim veri bland and herb with parsley rather than cilantro

banana cream pie httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbanderascottsdaleselecteniidlsw7sior6yof2saqeniidlsw7sior6yof2saq 15 the onli thing bananay about this dessert were the fat slice on the plate the pie itself had none the custard wasnt flavor with anyth no vanilla no banana no noth but was just your standard thicken egg yolk and the whip cream had no sugar or other sweeten mix into it and was complet bland this was less than halfeaten between 3 adults

w were a bit disappoint with our dinner and wont return in futur visit to scottsdal i wouldnt recommend it to anybodi who has been to anoth hillstonehouston in the pastif youv got the time then remington is the place  i made reserv on line for a wed night at 7 and they even call to confirm but when we show up they had no clue who we were  the maitr de said no problem give me a minut and then disappear  we were left stand for 10 minut befor a hostess came to seat us  we assum they were clear a tabl and were surpris when we were led into an almost empti dine room  
we were seat and although someon brought us water almost immedi it was anoth 10 minut befor our server show up and ask if we want menus  no let me guess what you have  a few minut later she came back with the menus and left us alon again  assum this was how the even was go to go we decid to skip ani appet and just order eat  get out as quick as possibl  unfortun remington must have like our compani becaus it seem they want to keep us there for as long as possibl  our salad arriv prompt at 8 1 hour after be seat  short after someon drop off a basket of dinner roll   butter would have been a nice touch  we finish our salad and sat wait for our entre  and sat and wait and sat and wait  at 830 our entre were final deliv  we ate our meal and as she was clear our plate we ask for the check so we could make our exit  and again we wait  the time stamp on our receipt show she rang us up a littl after 9 but it was almost 930 befor we allow to sign the bill  get out 
the one redeem factor of remington is the food  i had the tomatoonion salad and pork chop while my gf had the babi spinach salad and shrimp  all were wonder and certain worth the price on the menu but not worth the timeafter look at the menu and have a groupon burn in my pocket i was pretti excit to tri out remington restaur  unfortun that as far as the excit went as far as dine experi went 

pros
location

cons
fli land on bread bowl
host dress like morgu workers
food come out with plastic dome over it to keep warm but realli wasnt too warm anyways
felt veri date insid 
server point out total befor groupon like i was go to stiff him on tip 

overal i will not be back and wasnt impress at all  i guess if you are stay at the resort it not a bad choic but id still go for a quick drive to one of the mani other fine establish within a short distanci have been to the scottsdal ruth chris sever time for happi hour on the patio  the view is amaz  the problem is the service

last week my friend and i sat on the patio for 20 minut as the wait staff walk around ignor us  when we final order our drink which we had pick from the websit happi hour menu we were told that those were not on the happi hour menuth waitress had no intent of honor the websit list nor discuss it  

when our food came my slider were veri dryi wait for the waitress to come back around so i could ask for mustard  i waitedand waitedand wait   final i got up and ask the hostess to pleas get me some mustard  through the even i end up ask the hostess for mustard more water and the bill becaus our waitress was miss in action

w didnt decid to go to a local haunt for a drink nor did we decid to go to a megachain restaurantw chose the upscal spot pay the upscal price and expect an upscal experi which we did not getsushi grade ahi serv on a 500 degre block of himalayan sea salt
a lone short rib cube perch atop a bed of brais root veget so majest look it remind me of a sentinel on lookout
a hangar steak flank cook to perfection

al three share two common themes
both the present and sodium level were immeasurable

i love lon i want to show them off to my friend from out of town 
i love their wine cellarit dungeonesqu type features
i want to eat there on special occas becaus i know i wont be disappointed
but this trip had me rethink everyth i know about lon and that say someth sinc ive been go there for mani year now

th gravi on the hangar steak was ined it was so salti my girl secret wipe it all away so as not to creat a stir with our server know i would send it all back and give him a coupl of whatfer in the process
mi short rib was brais perfect howev it was dri and lean not what i was hope for
and the predinn bread basket had the most delici look chip also ined due to the extrem salt content

stay out of the bar
i order a crown royal manhattan
i was inform they dont serv crown royal but some bullshit well whiskey call buffalo trace serious who doesnt serv crown i expect lon to serv crown black for christ sakes
mi wife order a mai tai it was undrinkable

lon here some advic from the cheap seats
stop believ your own press clip and take a long hard look in the mirror

at the veri least hire an execut chef whose crave for salt doesnt rival a 14th centuri sailor sport a goiter the size of a basketbali keep go back to papago hope my dine experi will chang main becaus i love the orang blossom and their pizza

each time is the same i walk in and sit down wait then wait some more even though the place is fill the wait staff can be found stand and talk to each other behind the bar i wit the peopl next to us go to the bar for a beer becaus they were tire of wait for someon to take their order last time i check this place was not selfserv 

just last week my husband and i decid to tri papago one last time this time our strategi was to sit at the bar to avoid wait for someon to take our order the bartend behind the bar was nice he serv our drink quick 

howev what we observ while we sat at the bar made me never want to step foot in this establish again the bartend was argu with a young waitress about food that was sit in the kitchen her respons i didnt know where it went so i left it there the place is small im sure she could have figur it out there was anoth girl work that must have been her buddi the bartend who i assum was in charg was get on them probabl for be worthless they were roll their eye when he look away and had bad attitud while sit at the bar we watch at least ten custom have to come up and order their drink while the waitress stood talk and complain 

i told my husband if i own this place and saw the slow poor servic along with how mani custom had to go to the bar for servic i would be embarrass come to find out the owner had been sit behind us the entir night it amaz me how he could be in his own restaur and be complet oblivi to the poor custom servic  

i would much rather go out of my way and go to four peak mayb one day papago breweri will hire a pleasant effici wait staffmy husband and i have been here onc befor but just for drink and we had told ourselv we need to come back  well we did on a wednesday night and sat out on the patio let just saydont think we will be go back  our friend had join us well and were rather excit to tri the place out until we were there for almost 3 hour and had just got drink app and dinner  the servic was horribl and they werent even busythey use everi excus possibl on whi the servic was so bad  we had ask the hostess to speak to a manag and instead of get the manag she told our server who then came out ask if everyth was ok and did i do someth  final the manag had came out and realli didnt have a care in the world that we had such a bad experi  needless to say we will never go back there  not worth the money in ani wayi love jamba juic i hate jamba attitud 

jamba deserv 5 star for it array of flavor booster and option for juic smoothi etc yet when the manag stand there and patron you and seem to be annoy that you want to cash in on a free 16 oz jamba juic from a promo card that was a gift from anoth jamba manag then i have a problem this jamba is worthi of onli 2 star becaus let face it the teen behind the counter know how to make a mean peanut butter mood smoothi and instruct you that the straw tend to get stuck to the bottom of the cup so instead of suck up all the air in the room you can duti swirl the yummi cup content and exercis the straw enough until the jamba froth touch your tongu 

ill definit be go back for the peanut butter smoothi i just wont be go back to this jamba juicthis isnt realli a british place by ani reason account normal such place have a lot of atmospher  beer offer are skew toward thing british but here it is virtual like ani other bar there a few golf item here and there and the menu is golf theme but it pretti much just an ordinari bar

gui bass stella artoi hoegaarden weihenstephan newcastl smithwick a cider and other make the lineup of tap no fuller no whitbread not much at all that you would expect to find in a british theme place

fri food option basic and it set the aroma of the place as wellive driven past this place sever time and final decid to drop in and give it a tri  after brows their menu i decid to order

aft a short wait my food was readi  the burrito are pretti larg and come with chipsthat was an unexpect bonus  befor i jump into the burrito i tri the chipsthey were stale yuck

i then went for the carn asada burritotook one bite and was underwhelm  there was veri littl flavor to it  ok anoth biteand then anoth  wow this was the blandest carn asada burrito ive ever had  anoth uniqu thing was that the burrito had grill onion and salsa in itveri runni for a burrito like this  howev that didnt help with the flavor at all  as a matter of fact i onli ate 12 of it

next i tri the beansricechees burritoagain it was underwhelm and bland  i pour the spici salsa and roast pepper salsa on it to give it some flavorthat was it onli save grace

overal it was a veri disappoint dine experi  oh well it happen sometimes

return factor  2i have eaten here a number of time  a while back this place was pull 4star  everyth was fine but late it has realli been go down the drain  today for instanc mike c  i stop in for lunch  you pay first  then when i went to set my tabl place there were no teaspoon  i enter the kitchen are  ask for one which led to the manag tell me that they dont have them anymor becaus he tri to order some on the internet  got tablespoon instead  whi wasnt he correct the problem 2 minut later whenev that was  fine so ill get along without  just go get some salad

no i wont go get ani salad  the spot where the lettuc serv tray belong is empti  not even an empti tray but just some ice down in the hole there  back in the kitchen i ask for some lettuc to have a salad  this lead to the manag bring out a bowl of lettuc  a tray  pour the lettuc into the tray

along with my salad ill have some cottag chees  a littl of the seafood salad they alway have  well no i wont  they dont have either one ani more  in fact there is littl of anyth on the serv tabl that use to alway have a big bowl of the seafood salad one of hometown signatur dishes

th rest of the food was weak too  dish overcook empti serv tray water down tast soft serv ice cream blah lava cake  so on  i have eaten at hometown all over the countri mani mani time  i know exact how they are usual run  exact what most of the food is suppos to tast like  they need a new manag here who will bring this big restaur back up to the excel place it use to be     i could have had gelato 
the gspot is also on the way home i could have had a lot of other thing but i was just too lazi to get out of the car
th beauti carin and i were on our way home last night 
we attend the terrif yelp event at la bocca i grab a biscotto singular for biscotti on the way out delightfulcrispi and chocolati with sweet anis finish and i realli should have been satisfi with that but noooooooo i had to have someth els that turn out to be dq on scottsdal road 
if you happen to be go north on scottsdal road you cant success drive through this dq unless you success jump the median curb and avoid a head on collisional possibl with all wheel drive so i was good to go on that front howev i arriv at the speaker to place my order in a slight less relax state than i had anticip so i was less inclin to be forgiv when i order a waffl cone and heard my confirm come back as  it could have been that they were say yes sir we will have that cone readi for you at the window but well never know
got my cone 250 and it was alreadi drippyi know i know it soft serv that what she said but still i expect it to maintain a somewhat frosti and cohes state and wait until i get out of the drive through befor it fall on  my lap but i suppos it tast ok the part i got to eat instead of wear
so drip cone in hand we now get to tri to success leav the drive through at dq and return to our northbound headinggood luck we were again fortun that we have all wheel drive becaus the driveway is steep enough to be label curb in most jurisdict 
we bounc out into traffic and now need to make it across 3 lane of southbound traffic make a uturn across the median and negoti the northbound traffic flowwith one hand
i was save by 2 things
i spent part of my youth rodeo bareback bronc and i spent a consider longer time race sport and formula car so even with reflex and visual acuiti dull by age i was abl to safe negoti all of the hazard encount tri to drive through dq
i could have had a cookie
th ice cream stain came right outthis was my second time this week to experi defalco to say i was underwhelm both time would be an understatement

th first time was when we order pizza for friend that were come over for the even our friend were excit becaus defalco was a place they had heard realli great thing about and couldnt wait to tri their food the pizza though was just soso the sausag and pepperoni one was better than the vegetarian one becaus the meat ad some flavor to the whole thing but the veggi one was bland no one was impressed

mi dad has been go here for year though and he said their sandwich are what they are famous for so i forgav the subpar pizza and tonight we decid to see what all the hoopla was about im sorri that we did

1 i dont have a problem with sur restaur employe i was a sur barista for year but i have a problem with rude asshol worker my husband and i walk up to the counter and this guy turn and complain to his cowork about all the peopl come in realli dude peopl buy food here is what keep you employ he then bitch again about the same thing as i am attempt to order and he wont even acknowledg that i am the one order and will onli make eye contact with my husband like i wasnt there 

2 my husband order the greek veggi sandwich we got home with the sandwich and as he was check it out he notic that it has onli one piec of feta on the whole 12 inch sandwich and one cherri tomato on each sandwich half the rest of it is just cucumb and onion that it so he was essenti given a cucumb sandwich lame

3 my dad and i split a whole combo sandwich it was okay not great ive had better sub sandwich  my dad say that the sandwich were not like he rememb in the past and that this time they realli seem to skimp on the meat in the past he and his girlfriend had split the same sandwich and it was almost too much for them both that was not the case tonight 

the onli posit thing i have to say is that one of the peopl with us got a tuna sandwich and they said it was realli great she also think top ramon is good though so take her review as you wish

sorri to say that i dont think i will visit this establish again and my friend that want to tri the sandwich ill be encourag them not to botherso ive been back to ra a few time now and while the food is alway accept the servic has gotten progress wors each time today my cowork and i actual wait an unbeliev 50 minut for our food which  if your waitress stop by check in with you apolog let you know she know youv been wait  wouldnt have been near so bad still extrem annoy sure but forgiv not this waitress  we had to call her over for everi thing we need serioulsi not onc did she just stop by to check on us we had to call her over to place our drink order ask for sugar for our tea to place our food order to get the check everyth so by the time the food came i had to scarf down my grill appl teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minut to make it back to work on time that it ra  youv lost anoth customusual sushi restaur that know they have bellow averag nigiri make up for it by have uniqu and tasti roll this place fail on both counts

nigiri fish was stale almost like it was frozen just a few minut ago so there was almost no tast the rice was disgusting

rol we didnt finish most of the roll not becaus there was too much food but becaus it was hard keep it down

whi two star well the servic was great as were their miso soup and green tea so if you want some tasti miso with tea this is your place

mi friend from arizona beg me not to give them a bad review becaus he come here a lot this is the best i can do i was serious go to write someth a lot worsthe sushi was decent not great but definit not worth the hour wait to have it brought after i place my order to make thing wors individu dish were brought to our group with veri long interv in between so some member of our group had finish eat long befor other got what they order  happi hour price which were not all that low were not much of a redeem factor for the sorri experi of a meal i had heredamn stoner forgot to make my food how could you do this to me cheba hut ive love you for 9 year i understand the argument of not be allow to watch the flatscreen tv dure work hour is an import one but be that appar talk to each other is too big of a distract to not miss order im gonna have to side with manag on this one

th managerownerperson of author came out at the last second to earn this second star by give me a free rice krispi treat for my troubl which was freakin delicious

thi broke my heart cheba hut as i pretti much surviv onli on your dank nug and kind pinner through colleg but you did me wrong today 

get your shit togeth get some fresh prefer local veget and get the whini prepubesc boy out from behind the counter and ill consid come back

until then thank to the god aw salad and nonservic you guy are cashwhat i want to know is who the hell put sweet relish on a burger especi a burger that alreadi has dill pickl i mean i love pickl as much as the next asshol but i fn hate sweet relish so it pretti much ruin the whole thing 

asid from that my cur fri were perfect and they have cherri coke so here have 2 starive been go to pita jungl sinc it open when youd order at the counter now the togo counter and there was no hipster staff the place was the size of a shoe box and the food was alway excel someth is to be said for the fact that i keep go back recent though it seem like ive been chase my own tail in that regard 

the vegetarian select and portion size are superb ill give it that 

unfortun the servic is deplor i can get over the fact that theyr slowi mean i can excus it and not allow it to ruin my day what hard to get over is the fact that they rare acknowledg it take forev andor alway forget to refil drink and sometim complet forget you exist when there absolut no one eat except you and anoth person at 3 pm on a wednesday

also the food is veri hit and miss the temp locat seem to have a wors track record sometim the tuna salad will have 3 lbs of tuna enough to gag you but onli 4 sliver of lettuc sometim the rice is hot sometim it cold sometim the dress tast tangi other time it salti the pita burrito either could have so mani onion it make you cri other time it has virtual none they frequent forget to put the cucumb in the burrito as well it madden 

it as if their version of consist is have a chef back there whos juuuuuust stone enough to get the meal out in a littl over an hour 

also their togo order are much smaller portion size than when you eatin 

i love the food when it a good day and henc whi i keep go back to achiev my fix everi 5th time realli impress me they have a wide vegetarian select pretti good hummus and larg enough portion to give you 2 meal howev the price arent that cheap that coupl with inconsist food and bad servic tend to leav a bad tast in the mouth

1 star on a bad day 4 star on a good dayhere my scale system on how this place receiv 2 star from me  
i came here with 3 of my cowork for lunch thank we were seat right away becaus this place was pack 5 star there was onli one server so we wait and wait and wait about 10 minut befor he final came over to take our order after he took the order of two other tabl that came in after us 1 star  i initi want to order ban cuon dac biet 25 but the server told me no were too busi im not make that realli isnt this a restaur arent you in busi hope to have a full hous everi day  the item is on the  menu  tell me your out of it or someth not were too busi 2 star yes i deduct 2 star for this   i settl with 19  bun cha gio thit nuong  two of my cowork order basic the same dish i had but ad shrimp to their and one order the 1pho  they all enjoy their food 1 star  ive had better the grill pork was thin slice and a bit overcook so it was kind of tough to chew 1 starso we went on the busiest day of the week sunday we didnt follow our friend suggest egg maximilian and egg benedict and sad we werent impress  first off protect yourself in the park lot it reminisc of death race with peopl cruis around the park lot in strang contort circl tri to guess where the exit 4top has park in order to get into posit  my husband was wait for a place as in alreadi stationari when a woman in vw back up sever car and expect him to move  she was love   like jump cholla is love that is

th staff are definit friend  one of the server drop a plastic roach on my menu for my 3 year old while i was hold him  how was he to know that i am unreason afraiddisgust by them  he was tri to be nice  it look so real that the kid were afraid to touch it and instead tri to use my hand to prod it to see if it would move  luckili when our server came to take our order the roach stay insid the menu and would be a surpris for some futur diner no i do not feel bad about that 

between the four of us we order the cisco french toasteggsbacon combo egg and canadian bacon and huevo ranchero with both the green chili and red salsa  the french toast came out hot and was decent scrambl egg were fine and bacon crispi  the huevo was next  big disappoint bean were near cold the green chili was just warm egg were cook perfect but the plate just didnt do anyth for us  the green chili was veri unremark tortilla was good  the canadian bacon was the roughest piec of cb ive ever seen gristl around the edg and fat  the egg on the canadian bacon plate were order over easi but serv over hard  coffe is weak id have to say i like the bacon best which was crispi and thick 

i think my expect were way too high for this place  that be said my husband had no expect and he said he wouldnt bother to go back  if you go  mayb stick with the egg max with chorizo  that seem to be the 1 hit  and watch yourself in the park lotexcit to tri the new dd i arriv and see a line out the door good sign i think as i wait in line for 12 minut i come to realiz it is not the fact that so mani are here for the new revamp dd it is becaus of the kid work behind the regist i final get my turn and here goes

m  ill take the  5 with an ice coffee
dd  uhh i dont know if i can do that it wont let me put ice in the regist machine
m ok well can you ring it in as normal but make it ice instead of hot
dd  i guess but i could get in trouble
thought  from who the dd ice fair gimm a break
m  i wont tell

dd  we are out of the egg white scramble
m  ok then 1 with an ice coffee
repeat convers abov no joke

th sausag muffin thing was gross the amount of sugar they ad to my coffe immedi began to rot my teeth will not be go backlame the place is cram and stink the drink was ok and the price was ok some ratard spill my drink becaus he was oogel over my wife while she danc on the bar cant blame him and he did buy me anoth doubt i would be backhubbi has been eat most vegetarian late so we decid to check out green i dont think well go back 

everyth we ate we could get better elsewher hubbi padthaiish dish was pretti good with noodl a zippi sauc and big crunchi veggi all of which make the nasti of the eggless roll even more inexplic they were posit mushi insid and had both hot and cold spot mayb it just me but i like some textur and identifi ingredi in my egg roll they were also weird spice and arriv without the dip sauc advertis in the menu the busser admit they were made ahead of time which certain doesnt help matter he didnt seem to care that we thought they were bad he just shrug and said well some peopl dont like them well i guess were some peopl then we also tri the much prais pseudo crab puff and they were pretti good especi with the dip sauc that manag to come out with this plate hubbi also had to have the soy blizzard he like it and i thought the tast was fine initi but then had an aftertast i didnt care for 

the atmospher is clear meant for hipster youngster the light was so low that i liter had a hard time read the white on black menu serious green have some consider for your clientel over 20 

the last thing that left a negat impress was some of the staff as we finish our meal they were start to close hubbi went up to the counter to order his soy blizzard and the toocoolfortherestofus young man behind the counter had to ask a cowork if they were still make them um if you still have custom in the restaur i would imagin you should still be make them it not like we were in there for a half hour past close and there were still mani custom in the place 

one last observ what up with all the vegetarian and vegan smoker clog the entranc god forbid there be ani anim product in your bodi but bring on the tar and chemic as someon who quit smoke after mani year i would appreci it if green would insist that their custom observ the keepit20feetfromtheentr ordini was realli happi to find anoth vegetarian restaur in the phoenix area  my wife and i enjoy love hut but it alway nice to find more variety

w enter green with high expect consid the good review we saw here on yelp  i order a veggi burger of cours my wife got a meatbal po boy and my daughter got a rice bowl of some type  there were also some appet such as eggless roll and their chili fries

chili friesi look forward with great anticip to these and it look like i expect too much  what pass for chili fri here are shoestr potato light sprinkl with thyme not bad in themselv which are then cover with a concoct of what appear to be morningstar farm veggi crumbl mix with tomato sauc and one or two spice which i couldnt identifi  it was realli not all that good  it tast like someon was tri to doctor up veggi crumbl and realli didnt know how  ill say this muchit wasnt chili in ani capac that i would recognize

in term of the burger i think that at least at first they did a good job of mask the bland of the the red bean patti at the center  the present and appear was pretti nice  howev by the time i took my last few bite i was need to wash it down with my diet coke  again it was a not veri success attempt to make a meatless food attract hip and tasti  you can do it if you know how  im not sure if the folk in the kitchen at green realli have a handl on it

mi wife poboy was a similar stori  again look like morningstar farm meatless meatbal  they put them in a bun with mum sauc and soy chees  i tri a bite  tast like a meatless meatbal coat in ketchup on a bun

th eggless roll were  okay  again there was someth miss in the flavor

th atmospher was hip and cool  the bathroom were actual realli neat look  servic was friend and help  the food was eh  dont be fool into think that becaus they put up this big present and say with fanfar were vegan mean that the food here is good  it realli mediocr and the onli thing prevent it from be one star in my opinion is the work that they put into decor atmospher and servic  if you want to come here with a friend share a basket of thyme fri or a dessert you probabl wont be disappoint  if you want a great meatless meal in the phoenix area howev the suprem master chinghai has the lock on iti realli dont know how to rate this place im give it two star becaus i serious have experienc better let me explain

mi friend and i after wander around for near an hour search for somewher to eat our quest end or atleast we thought it was go to end at lo cascio we enter a veri quaint and fancier than it realli ought to be littl italian place there was a young coupl a middl age coupl and a three top alreadi enjoy their meal we sat down and tri to figur out what to order

th servic was soso noth great but we order anyway i order the gnocci with tomato sauc and sausag my friend order the speghetti and meatbal we had differ soup befor our meal and were serv the soup along with our teas

mi bean and pasta soup was not good it was serious a bowl of pinto bean with some pasta in it no spice no veggi noth but pinto bean and babi macaroni wtf my friend minastron yeah i know it mispel wasnt that great eaither no complaint but no rave review eaither we had hope the entre were go to be better when

what the hell do you mean you wont serv me anoth drink

a shout from the middl age man who sat with im assum was his date a small petit blond woman the server tri her best to get the man to settl down the more she tri to calm him down  the angrier the bastard got he got to the point where he was yell and scream at her and even stood up and got in her face

th male busser who serv us our tea watch while hide behind a drink station along with one of the cook anoth male we watch in sympathi as the poor waitress was be bulli by this guy it took everyth for me not to get up and kick this guy ass

rememb where you are this is scottsdal if the cop show up theyr gonna throw us both in and let his ass go free was the word i need to hear serious i wish scottsdal polic would quit be so racist 

final when he had his face in her i said fuck it

wher is your manag i ask to the entir room the busser came and he said that the threetop next to us were the owner an elder woman and her husband and brother own the damn restur and were now stare into their soup and drink tri to pretend the entir thing wasnt happen no bodi was go to defend this poor girl i start to get up fuck it take me to jail

y i realli do get that hood im sorri  im not your averag yelper i have and will probabl cut a bitch again 

and final the elder woman with her neckbrac and cast arm serious im not lie got up and tri her best to calm the man down i was appaul i never seen such an outburst like that sinc the last time i ate in scottsdal haha i just realiz that but even then the manag intercept right away and took care of the rowdi custom in this case i realli think the owner would have let this guy get violent with her i know violent men and i know how they work and this guy was on the edg 

we call the busser asid and ask for our check for the food that we were serv and not the food we order they gave it to us along with a coupon for 20 our next visit i vow to give this place anoth try

seri it wasnt their fault no one want this guy to becom a jerk he chose that and sometim it not right to fault a restuant on the behavior of it custom and that guy was load and obvious had one too mani the waitress was just do her job but it was not okay for the owner to let her get abus like that ever

i have even seen execut chef come out of the kitchen and calm custom down anoth time i dine in scottsdal haha errrm im notic a theme but i never seen a bunch of scare ass pussi look the other way like that so for that this place lose major starfirst visit 3 star second visit 2 star unfortun  i dont doubt the pasta is still aok but i have to knock them down for their entrees salad  

i order a caesar with chicken  the addit of the chicken bump the price of this jewel up to 1295  while plenti the romain was so drench in dress the crisp of the lettuc was lost  the chicken was mediocr at best certain not worth the 5 buck to add it  a shame becaus the dress was pretti good

mi husband order the antipasto per due  with back oliv artichok ham salami provolon and anchovi it should have been a hit  but again drench in vinaigrett  also the meat and chees were just thin slice noth of except qualiti  at 1495 this was a miss

w also order bruschetta but i had forgotten all their bread is sesam seed sub roll  better bread is a must  while i might consid lo cascio again ill stick with pasta  if you see me carri a duffel bag insid i brought my own baguett toowhat was that freak smell holi crap smell like a dirti diaper wrap in fart permeat the entir restaur sure didnt do much to make the greasi overpr food ani more appet ill tell you that thought mayb it was a onetim thing but after a quick scan of a coupl previous review it seem to be a recur theme with this place yuckmuch like my eriberto review there are certain guidelin and code of conduct that are associ with slice and while i am current a littl too lazi to make an in depth crack at it here the jist

whi would you eat this garbagcaff boa is about as excit as bulk trash pickup day

th servic is so bad it make the termin 4 baggag claim at sky harbor look like it staf by noth but jacki chan clone  that mean boa is slooooooow folks

im befuddl by the mysteri of their menu tri to discern if what beauti item i appear to order are actual what in front of me  ogerp pasta  oh yeah i get it  it prego clever spell backward  next on the list etnom led asparagus appar some region in tuscany

peopl are alway up on their shit about their happi hour which i make my eye roll right out of my head because

1  their bar is about as big as a subaru vivio
2  their special onli appli when sit in the vivio
3  there are certain no help chauffeur  

fortun for me it pretti far out of the way which make it almost certain that i can have some excus for not drive all the way to temp to be spare to deathfor 2 year caff boa was my go to hh place  my friend and i would meet here for mani reason to celebr the complet of a big assign a new job or promot the end of tough a week a drink befor a  vmari show wednesday  i brought my parent my inlaw and friend visit from out of town to hh here   it was our spot

what in the name of the happi hour god happen here 

i rememb a time where you got an entir loaf of bread and a bowl of oliv oil  they replac that with three dip sauc and a bread basketi took it in stride  then it just becam pass bread which was rough but i was still abl to use the bread to soak up the adriatico sauc  on my last trip we had to ask sever time  for bread  

they use to have so mani good wine on hh  oh how i love those wine  now they have a hand of their worst one  no more of my favorit albarino  no more cava

then there was the food  my friend and i would alway order sever order of shrimp adriatico which was full of plump jumbo shrimp   the various cheesetomato base plate were larg enough for 4 to share  what we were serv on our last visit was tini shrimp that did not seem fresh in a meager amount of sauc the capriatta was now a slice of bread with chees on it and was larg enough mayb for 2 to cut up and share  

i almost cri when we were last there  it was a terribl hh in general made wors by the fact that i sat there know how great it onc was  now my friend and i are in the market for a new hh spotperhap i overreact  ive chang my rate from one star to two star  this place is overr and not at all what it use to be but it better than mcdonalds

th wine list use to be incred  the appet were wonder  that is all in the past  the updat wine list manag to hack off a bunch of wonder thing some great local wine for instanc  instead i keep see thing from croatia which are horribl  if you see the croatian zinfandel just let your eye keep wander  the prosciutto and melon is pretti weak as is the chees plate  portion are small  everyth is overpriced

update

 chang the review although not the rate after be told that jay has own it sinc day one  as i wrote him i use to love this place  i went when it was in a tini build further south on mill ave  and even a year ago i enjoy it  i was under the assumpt there was a chang in ownership becaus of the nosed caff boa took in the last year  it hard to imagin that an establish could slip the way they have under the same manag  as i wrote jay if i was rate caff boa a year ago i would have given him four star  but they are not what they were and they dont provid an enjoy experi for me

anoth update

i sent the owner a messag say that i was apolog for say this was a problem with new ownership when he has been there sinc day one  here is his response

onc again i stand my my award win wine list  it is one of the veri best in the valley  we are not consisten get award includ best of for our wine list in newtim just last week for horribl wine as this person states
our food wine and hospit speak for themselv  come see whi we are one of the best place to dine in the valley for yourselv  it certain is easi to be negat in these open blog type site but we have been around along time not for serv anyth short of great  that whi after 77 review to date on yelp the averag is 4 star  peopl like this are not the norm of course

mi respons to him is that hes right  his food wine and hospit do speak for themselv  they speak volum  my hope is that someday jay can check his ego and listen to critic from pay customi was realli look forward to go to caff cafe boa on mill yesterday i love that they tri to buy local and sustain foodsproduct so major kudo for that i also love the atmospher expos brick wall tall window good light cute patio 

so whi the low star for the price i just expect better i had the risotto which sound realli good but i didnt realli enjoy it also my friend is a strict vegetarian and was told that the chef will not make ani substitut or chang to menu item not even put an item on the side that just annoy me i get that some chef view their dish as work of art and are insult at the idea of alter plus chang can definit mean extra work for the kitchen but i know peopl who have work in the food industri who say that they want their custom to have a pleasant experi and enjoy their food and are happi to adjust as need 

id be open to give caff boa anoth shot but so far it a meh on my listcaff boa has definit been an interest place to visit my husband and i bought a groupon to caff boa and attempt to use it 3 week ago we arriv at 700 and were direct to the bar where we wait and thank were entertain by a friend bartend after wait about 10 minut we were seat direct insid the front door it was a place i never would have put a tabl but we were hungri so we didnt request a differ tabl our server came out told us the special bla bla bla he was so softspoken we could bare hear a singl thing he said after over an hour our server reappear and apolog for our wait and told us that our food would be out short after anoth half hour and a visit from the manag insist that our food would be out immin the food arriv the fri chicken was flavorless while the green tast as though the chef had accident pour in too much salt i took one bite my husband took anoth and we return the dish and share my husband voodoo penn which was mediocr but we were hungri and it was edibl we were given a 50 and promis that futur dine experi would be better

w return 2 week later had a love supper with and a delight knowledg and  prompt server name justin i order the risotto with pork belli and my husband order the lasagn the meal wasnt anyth i couldnt have made at home but it tast good our wine was superb and we were happi justin suggest the macaron for dessert they were incred hand down the best macaron ive ever eaten and i not onli make them myself but have eaten them all over the world the macaron and our server are the onli reason i didnt give caff boa a 1 star review

wel we forgot to use our groupon on our second meal so ala last night we attempt to go out to supper again we had a 700 reserv were seat prompt and given water and some stale bread and mayobutterol oil stuff to dip it in we order immedi upon see our server justin again over an hour pass and still no food the tabl near us not onli didnt have food but did not have water sinc the restaur had run out of water glass and appear to have been given complimentari wine instead  did we get free wine for our wait nope justin did offer to bring us more bread then return to inform us that the bread was in the oven and would be done momentarili 20 minut later there was still no bread and no supper be hungri tire and frustrat we left justin stop us and took our name and phone number so a manag could call us today so far no call 

i still have the stupid groupon to use

at this rate it would probabl be in our best interest just to request the money back from groupon instead of tri to dine at caff boa perhap foolish i did make a reserv for sunday im go to give them one last chanc wish us luckrealli caff boa you know better you know better than let me stand outsid for 15 minut wait for your hostess while you are less than 14 full for brunch you know better than charg me 1400 for an egg benedict that come with noth more than 2 egg on an english muffin
 im here for the organ sustain impecc food and i can afford it but where is it 

 you know better than give me a server that know noth about your product yes i do want to know if your meat is local organ sustain im pay 14 a head for beakfast so bring on the knowledg im eat here becaus you say you serv an organ sustain product show me you do also you know better than give me a server who look like they just roll out of bed in their grubbi stain black pullov i appreci the attempt at a black uniform but make it clean next time as well  final if i order two glass of spark dont charg me 18 for the all the can drink when charg me 8 a glass would have been cheaper serious is this ani better than panhandl 

so where the hell is the caff boa of dinner fame the food the knowledg the attempt to prove to me that what i was pay for was worth it where is that caff boa becaus it sure didnt show up for brunch todayim kinda bum that this place live up to the bad review the host seem to have no clue what they were do they seat tabl that were obvious still dirti which was gross the drink took a while and the food took 25 minut the server was cute and friend but didnt save the meal unfortun the staff stop and danc which was cute but i wish they had pay a littl more attent to their tabl instead i order the blacken mahi sandwich it came with a big piec of fish on a cheap bun with lettuc and tomato it need someth els i had to use the sauc from my friend crab cake sandwich to give it more flavor a manag came and check on us but onli briefli i wish the experi was better than it was unfortun i probabl wont go back herethis place in general is a littl too cheesi for me  they offer mediocr seafood with over the top waitstaff  the waitstaff remind me of the movi offic space where they tri to be over excit that you are there  it is almost like you are buy a use car   

i will start with the food  it is veri messi and drizzl in butter  dont wear ani good cloth or risk have butter splotch all over  the food itself is just ok  noth to write home about  

the ontap beer select is less than desir  if you like mass produc beer then you are in luck  

i would say save your money go to a local own restaur where you wont be subject to all of the cheesiive been here a coupl of time and the onli thing that pop into my head is meh the bbq sauc is meh and leav a nasti linger after tast the rib tip platter is ok noth to get too excit about this place meh ive experienc better031910

kitschi fun countrylif decor  there was about a 15minut wait time  lot of older citizen wait which made for interest chitchat amongst the women  it refresh when a restaur set allow peopl to feel comfort enough to interact among stranger mom and i encount so mani close individu on a daili basi at work so this is a nice chang of pace for us  staff here seem friend and busi but effici  at least our was  one complaint it a bit cramp in here  it would be nice to have a littl privaci from other neighbor tabl especi when i spi a room in the back that had mayb four 4top and onli one was occupied

c recal what mom order but i wasnt surpris that she didnt enjoy it the menu descript definit did not appeal to me  websit doe not list a menu and all i can recal is that it was an omelet w a coupl of fibrous veggi snow pea and someth els it was a strang combo of that im sure of  chestnut mayb  i went w a belgian waffl two egg and bacon  coffe was weak but our server offer to brew a stronger pot  nice  while we wait for our select she brought out some minimuffin to enjoy and that we did  we both realli like the bran  i also enjoy the zucchini mom thought she detect cinnamon not a fave of her but i think it the nutmeg she was refer to  then again i may be mistaken

waffl was well a waffl  no accompani fruit compot or couli to liven thing up  i alway bring my own 100 organ mapl syrup becaus while most restaur say they offer mapl syrup it isnt 100 pure but a blend of mapl and corn syrup  if it smell like mrs butterworth it isnt 100 mapl  just sayin  egg were cook to overmedium just that way i like em  bacon was veri nice

cut saucer and dinner plate love minimuffin we bought extra togo good bacon and effici servic make for a solid two star  i wouldnt mind give ktc anoth tri if were in the area  next time well tri the pancak and crepeit 9pm on a wednesday night i just land from san francisco and i hadnt slept the night before

i shouldnt judg i realli shouldnt i may end up here in 26 year when i am at the equival age of the major demograph in fact thank god this place exist otherwis we may have to worri about the douchebag and douchebaguett credit dalla g infiltr our belov downtown favorit 

2 star for the mojito and wasabe dip sauce

meeeeoooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwthey quit sell fri oyster couldnt tell me whi either the fri oyster were my favorit toodamso disappoint i heard such great thing about johnni mac but after have pizza there for dinner i am far from impressed

i went in with my husband on a monday night we were seat in a booth that had ice on the seat leav me with a love wet spot on my ass the hostess ask what we would like to drink but didnt know what beer they had perhap manag should consid not have drink order taken by a young girl that doesnt even appear to be old enough to serv liquor a second employe came by with our water a few minut later 

we look over the menu wait for one of the multipl waitress that walk by to stop and acknowledg us final someon came over gave us an excus about how no one knew whose tabl we were and took our order 

we went with a larg mushroom pizza i debat get wing sinc i heard such good thing about them but decid to pass the pizza didnt take long to come out it felt like we wait longer to order then we did for the food 

upon first glanc the pizza was all good nice thin crust that was golden brown lot of chees plenti of mushroom the chees was tasti as were the mushroom the crust was like rubber though when i pick up a piec to tri to take a bite it flop over the onli part of the crust with ani crunch to it was the edg pretti disappoint 

if i had never heard of johnni mac this would be my first and onli time visit sinc i live nearbi i will probabl give them anoth shot sooner or later everyon has an off night at some point rightwell i have to admit im one of the few peopl that enjoy walmart i like the cheap price and varieti what i hate about everi walmart is the peopl unfortun this locat specif is ok it smaller then most so varieti is limit but i dont have to walk mile of aisl for quick pick me up 

the food from the deli section is pretti good and they keep it fresh all the isl are alway stock the pharmaci is effici but they do take for ever must be becaus of their close proxim to st rose de lima their demand is high 

i hate that they onli keep 2 to 5 cashier open their custom servic is quicker though i often go for money order and even with a long line it take no more then 10 minutit alright decent price no wait and servic is fast 

i onli had a spam musubi for 2 it help eas my growl stomach i had a few bite of the kalua pork  it was okay i wish the cabbag and the pork were more shred and it was too wateri i like it a bit more dri the rice that came with was not hot and was not soft either it tast like day old rice  no bueno

on anoth note this place definit satisfi your hungri stomachafter a 10 hour drive from sf to vega we were anxious to fill our growl tummi after hear about the best hawaiian food at the california hotel and see the pictur of delici poke on yelp we were sold we didnt have to return our rental car for a few hour so we quick drove 20 minut off the strip to aloha specialti restaur 

what a disappoint first of all we were told that they havent serv poke in about a year talk about fals advertis if your look to order poke look elsewher they dont have it here 

fine everyth els on the menu look appet enough that we could probabl still be satisfi san poke right wrong when we got our meal no one left satisfi i wouldnt suggest wast gas cab money or calori here at allonc upon a time this place was the mecca for gambler downtownthat was until jack binion gave it to his sister becki  sinc then it been run down close sold to harrah the world seri of poker move to the rio and sold to anoth ownerit a shell of it former self  no longer is it worth the trip to see it  sad

return factor  10a friend of mine has been rave about los molcajet for some time now so a coupl of weekend ago a group of friend and i decid to have a late lunch here well   they have live mariachi on saturday from 35 good now as it is i am kind of a grump when it come to live music in restaur and oh my god the place is sooo small and they were use microphon it was so loud but then again i am a grump and sometim act like an old fart everybodi els was there to have a good time and not convers with their tablem so to each their own

i didnt particular like the food either for the three of us we decid to share two molcajet one with beef and anoth with shrimp and beef the dish is serv with cactus tomato and jalapeño all smother in a sauc for some reason i thought the dish would be differ i had heard the dish was serv with sauc but some i thought like a chile tomat y cebolla kind of sauc like liter salsa so the dish somewhat threw me off it is a tomatobas sauc it doesnt tast bad per se but as i said i was expect someth else

th servic is great our waitress was super nice and attent and get you your beer super fast although she couldv told us about the cubeta promot where you get a bucket of beer for x amount instead of pay individu for each onemeh  ive experienc better  i order a thai ice tea 300 the yellow curri with chicken 850 and a beef pad see ew 750  the thai ice tea was pretti good  it was tone down in the sugar depart which is good for some folk but if you are look for that sweet you might be disappoint  

the yellow curri was pretti bland  even order hot with extra chili powder it wasnt anyth to rave about in the flavor depart  appar they normal make this curri fair sweet but i specif ask for it without extra sugar  i can imagin this curri with the extra sugar and it would probabl be a typic american curri  the curri sauc was wateri which i normal like  the other thing i like about this curri was that the chicken seem to be precook and was veri tender  also the portion of chicken was nice size  there were a coupl of thin slice pepper though that were pretti skimpy

i also order pad see ew woth beef to go to go with my alpha dog doubl red from big dog yum  the noodl were a bit on the overcook side although that could have been due to my microwav i have microwav pad see ew mani time and never had this problem though  the noodl were a bit on the dri side as far as the sauc use but that was ok for me  the kicker was that they dont have chines broccoli so this was serv with american broccoli  

overal this place might be good for the lunch special but there are so mani good thai place around here  the servic was friend but a littl slow  the food was okish

edit it been a while sinc i have thrown out left over thai food  the soggi noodl were just gross  in fact i have decid to dock thai bbq a starthe dim sum here was hit or miss i came came here with some famili that were alreadi in town right after i flew in some of the dim sum was 4 or 5 star while most were realli bland in tast ive been here befor and would have given it a 4 star review at my prior visit here i was pretti disappoint overal with the food here the other day still the dim sum here is pretti cheap though

w order the usual dim sum dish which includ a varieti of dumpl steam dish and fri goodi we order quit a bit of food so im just go to highlight the goodi the sticki rice dish the steam chicken paw and a few of the fri goodi were all pretti good while everyth els we order was mediocr at best

i might have to check out anoth dim sum place next time this place isnt the go to place that ive alway reli on it to belunch is 40 star banquet room is 10 star averag is 25 round down to 20 becaus our cater event realli suck with a 3300 price tag

th lunch  40 stars

when i want to eat at a sit down filipino food in vega not at a turoturo style salo salo is an obvious choicetheyr known for good food and a clean restaur  theyr definit a much better lunch and dinner restaur than a special event cater facil  

at lunch  for the price 912 dollar for most lunch special you get pretti good food their wait person are veri nice  the food is authent and fresh and the present is good  there are lot of famili insid this open type of layout so it kind of loud and live the five of us tri mani differ dish includ the sinigang kare kare lichon pansit fri seafood and all were pretti good   

of cours my extrovert sister like alway made friend with the tabl to our right  next thing we know theyr tri out some of our stuff and vice versa  i was too full to tri anyth els though there someth about filipino around the tabl share food and convers actual i was save up for their delici bibinka  

one thing i didnt like was their  pansit the noodl dish their had way too much fish sauc  i guess im use to my mom home made version which has more flavor with onli a tad fish sauc salo salo dessert are overal good esp their excel bibingka bake in banana leaf  imo this is the best thing they make  i also like their halo halo  

the banquet room  10 star

w like their lunch food enough that we decid to have my parent anniversari parti there turn out that wasnt such a good idea as a banquet venu they were below expect  it cost about 33 a person and there were about 100 of us  for that we got their precook bland lumpia and pansit white rice and three entre cook in bulk and kept lukewarm sort of  it was buffet style i thought there would be more entre nope  we got our own room but it was not well appoint as the main restaur it was like be put in the spare storag room with spars decor 

we did get entertain howev  well sort of  he was a dj and singer suppos  the most recent song he play as a dj was cher believ we had our parti in 2008 and that cher song was around 2000 we did like some of the old disco tune  but with 13 of the attende under  30 we want to hear hip hop and modern danc music  he didnt have ani hip hop or rap song as a dj in vega what up with that as far as his sing he could sing okay over his too much echo karaok machin  

imo it was not worth the   33 dollar a person   most place give you that rate with a sit down dinner in a realli nice venu it would have been better for all 100 of us of us to have gone to the regular restaur and order dinner individuive never been a fan of quizno and this locat in particular isnt great the servic is alway subpar when we approach the counter i alway feel like im bother them they bare utter a word of greet and cant seem to be bother to even crack a smile or ask if were readi to order on everi occas i have been here i have to start the interact which is a littl annoy we came here recent becaus im a groupon addict and i just cant seem to resist ill stick to firehous sub and subway in the area insteadthis is not the pop of yore this is a vega institut that is ride on the laurel of day past

nowaday the sandwich are get smaller but the price are get taller are they good yes but not for the price they are asking

and whi is that well for one they are in one of the busier intersect in town so not onli do you suffer the nois and heat  and exhaust of car after car but you stand probabl the best chanc of get into a traffic accid here more than just about ani other restaur in town 

also the place need some spruce up it is look run down and weather it actual look sunbak 

so where did the pop of yesterday go whi it chang hand and with differ owner come differ price structur and these chang arent alway subtl it kind of look like the pop of old and it kind of tast like the pop of old but it isnt the pop of old

now on to the chees whiz aspect actual work realli well but when they start at 999 for a basic no frill sandwich you feel a littl cheat and when your pay 1499 for a place where you sit outsid in the nois and heat and add it all upwel hell you just feel plain cheat after youv finish your dinki size sandwich  when compar to not long ago  

and i dont give a woodchuck behind if you feel cheat that isnt the feel you want at a mom  pop drivein diner and now divedear goldilocks

i wait to get a yummi drink just becaus i knew we were head here after our breakfast at the chowk down the street appar you folk are not so consist from locat to locat be from cali and privileg to have tri your avocado shake i was super eager to have one in vega of cours the peopl  the counter thought i was crazi whatev i guess the onli thing go for this locat is the all you can eat breakfast for about 5bux that was post on the door pleas make the appropri chang with what you read from me  other yelpers

respect 
kriss psee those 2 star up there they serv as a remind that no matter how good your food is if the servic blow then youv lost me as a custom forev 

came here midafternoon on a tuesday when it was live but not exact crowd 

our waiter a diminut mexican with a thick accent and leopard mohawk which beli person came by to take our drink order i went with a tradit mojito and my gf got a sangria 

onc they were drop off he came back to take our food order we want to sampl a lot so i order the bacon wrap date tuna pepper lamb skewer and fish stick 

man everyth was awesome

mi mojito was perfect prepar the bacon wrap date are astound good theyr small but each one pack a serious flavor punch tuna pepper were light  refresh with a slight kick the fish stick had a tasti sauc accompani them but otherwis i wasnt over impress but the lamb skewer rock and they came with a side of ah geez it was either couscous or quinoa it was great 

everyth was so great in fact that we were die to order more but our waiter was mia i scan the place for him  nada the few time i did see him he showcas his learn skill in the art of how to not make eye contact with custom after around 1015 of this shtick i gave up 

final i flag down a busboy and ask for the check 

then our waiter magic appear with the check and ask me if i want dessert 

your joke right i told him no and hand him my card sinc i didnt feel like wait to see when hed show up to collect my payment he return it quick with a mutter thank you that sound like someon forc him at gunpoint to say it 

i gave him around a 6 tip which my dad later told me shouldv been zero per his wisdom a low tip onli make you look cheap but no tip say fuck you you suck 

shouldv gone zero 

i might return here  the food was so damn good i could make my mouth water just think about it but the shit servic had me so hop mad after we finish that i couldnt wait to jet out of there 

if your a manag tell the mohawk server to grow a person commensur with his hairstyl you lost more of my money becaus of him and ive got a sneak suspicion im not the onli onea varieti of thought were run through my head throughout our time here
1 chef selvaggio should be embarrass to have his name on the front
2 i realli hope the manag stop by to ask how were doing

jim g and i grab a few small bite in the bar area i just want to tri one pasta and didnt want to take up a whole tabl to do so  frank the server might have been pleas this place was dead anyway  perhap our terribl servic stem in part from the fact that we had bar server to me that still no excus in a fine dine establish  kristina our server was veri polit no question but not at all good  

we order oyster and a bottl of champagn  the oyster arriv and when i ask the food runner what type they are he has no idea he run off to ask and final return with the answer  we are still wait on our champagn oyster are get warm and there no champagn  we see the manag georg walk by with the champagn  in the corner both he and the bartend are tri to give kristina a tutori on open champagn  our oyster are get warm here peopl  the bartend final come over to open it and we final get to enjoy our love combination

w also order a scallop crudo and the garganelli neri pasta  both come out way too earli oyster still on the tabl and togeth  there no sens of pace  the crudo is good with granni smith appl slice and an age balsam  the pasta is not at all what i expect but it is tasti  the descript with a lobster carbonara complet with sea urchin made it sound creami unctuous and decad  while there was a cream sauc not veri much of it and there were lobster piec the dish lack the feel and flavor the descript suggest  

empti plate pile up no one come to pour the champagn and while all this is not happen the manag is stand there watch the dallasmiami game  kristina final come over to take some of the empti plate and proceed to stack them on top of each other on our tabl decid to unstack a few put them back onto our tabl becaus shes scare shell drop them  has no one train these server how to work in a nice restaurant

i will never return to valentino las vega anyhow and sincer hope someon in manag but not georg read this review and doe someth to remedi the glare error in servic this experi realli give chef selvaggio and his michelin star a bad name6 for one scoop of gelato  give me a fcking break

just becaus it locat in the venetian in the fauxsan marco squar doesnt mean that you can get away with charg highway robberi price for inauthent mediocr gelato

i tri two sampl here their plain yogurt and their pistachio  the textur of the gelato was like ice cream and it was ici  authent gelato is denser than ice cream  and the flavorth pistachio tast artifici and had a hint of appl  and a bitter aftertast  the yogurt was just too sweet and creamylack the tast of yogurt  haagendaz is so much betterand that not even real gelato

i know eateri in vega tend to be overpr but this is ridicul  550 for one scoop  and 1 extra for a cone  keep in mind that in venic a scoop is onli 12 euro  but even in the state it usual about 34  but 6  the onli reason whi this place doe busi is becaus it exploit the unsuspect wellheel tourist who think their gelato must be good becaus it locat in the venetian

to top it off their servic was unfriend and slow   i guess it onli appropri that this place is in vega sinc cocolini is the whore of gelatteriai heard about this place on yelp talk vega and thought id give it a tri for lunch today  it locat in an older ethnic area of vega that has a larg hispan popul so i thought i was on the right track  i was excit as i pull into the park lot  i couldnt wait to get insid and tri it out

th restaur is small with about 4 tabl for 16 peopl and counter seat for anoth 810 peopl  it sound like a lot but it cram into a small area where chair are back to backveri tight space

th menu is pretti extens but i found it shock that they dont have burrito on the menuwhat  one of my favorit dish and they dont have itoh well i didnt give them a strike for that  i saw that they had the bottl mexican orang soda that i love so i bought a bottl with the meal

i opt for an asada torta  a chees quesadilla it sound redund  i hate say it but that what was on menuthought id tri two item becaus i was hungri and i want to get a good feel for their food

th tabl have the standard mexican red  green salsa on the tabl for your conveniencehomemad which is a plus  when the food came out i was kind of disappoint with the size of the torta but it about qualiti not quantiti so i wont dock them for that  they also brought out a small bowl of pickl pepper almost like italian giardiniera pepperscool i love those  howev the asada was veri tough and blandstrik 1  it was pretti flavorlessso i had to add a lot of the pickl pepper  hot sauc to make it palatablestrik 2

when they brought out the quesadilla i was surpris to see that it was deep fri and look like an empanada see picslook better than it tast though  it too was bland  wow  i couldnt believ itso again i dous it with hot sauc and finish it becaus i was starvingstrik 3

i realli realli realli want to like this place but the food was just too blandi tri 2 item and it was a bust  damn that too bad

wil i come back  im tornmayb to tri the taco and give them a chanc for redempta tip for las vega local make sure to get the hometown hot spot sticker ad to your hilton reward card it will score you 25 off your bill at benihana and other hilton restaur you have to have a nevada id to get this sticker though

th 25 discount was the main reason my husband and i went to benihana a hand of time in the past as we both enjoy hibachi style cook when it is done well and i love discount benihana isnt exact cheap either 25 for chicken 35 for shrimp 40 for a steak and shrimp combo and there is an addit charg if you want fri rice 

benihana is a beauti restaur i love walk through the garden past the pond to take the elev up to the restaur ambianc can realli add to one eat experi and it clear from the garden area that benihana want peopl to enjoy be there to dine 

sad the ambianc dure out last visit to benihana was visual onli  after be seat we look over the menu as  we wait for other custom to be seat  even if you make a reserv if your parti is small you will be made to wait until anoth parti can be seat with you which can be somewhat annoy i understand the busi side of it to an extent but in a town where peopl make plan for after dinner like purchas show ticket prompt seat and servic is import thank a larg group arriv short after us so the wait was onli a few minut 

order were place drink were brought out all was go well so far mayb it is becaus it was not my first time to benihana but the chef routin seem bore like i had seen it befor probabl becaus i had the other hibachi style restaur i have eaten at and enjoy  had fun interest chef that put their own spin on thing and interact well with the group this chef did not it felt like he was just go through the motion 

and then it happen a fire alarm went off complet assault our ear drum  and it kept go off and go and go like the god damn energ bunni almost 10 straight minut of a blare alarm right over our head which the employe of benihana seem pretti oblivi to by the time it had stop my husband and i both had headach and had decid to skip out on the rest of the thing we had plan for the even 

sinc benihana is in the hilton the alarm situat could veri well have been out of the control of the benihana manag ignor it was not appropri though 

to top it off our food was over cook 40 for well done steak request it be medium rubberi shrimp and a pound headach even with the 25 discount i doubt i will be back for a long while if everi didnt stay at the riv as hotel employe refer to it make it sound swankier than the reput that preced it as the riviera i onli spent two day here for a convent 

if the hotel in vega were women this hotel would be the girl with bad extens wear ugg boot and a babi tee in 2014 she wouldv look somewhat accept 12 year ago but now she is just a sad chain smoke wash up weather old hag that you dont feel good spend time with 

that is the riv also the food court is a verit russian roulett of food poison adventurif i were in charg of an mm store on the strip i would have

 free samples
 lifes huggabl mms
 a demonstr of mms melt in your mouth not your hand even in the vega desert 
 hot chick and dude clad onli in mms
 a glamour barloung featur candycolor cocktail and novelti beer with mms float in it
 a cirqu du soleil show where the acrobat onli wear mms
 high stake poker with the lifes huggabl mms as dealers
 strippers

but someon els is in charg of the mm store on the strip and so it doesnt have ani of those thing instead it has

 four floor of stuff that say mms on it for sale
 a cheesi 3d movie
 a probabl cheesi tour i didnt go on
 no free samples

i guess that probabl more in line with the mm brand than stripper booz and gambl but then i dont realli understand what theyr do on the strip whatevas you can probabl tell this place is chock full of mm swag  it a great place to take kid  sinc we had our with us on our recent las vega trip we brought her here  she like the place well enough and found some souvenir for her friends

ther wasnt much here to appeal to me though i like the look of the wall o mm dispens  you could choos from a huge varieti of color and flavor  im not a big mms fan but the pretzel version caught my eye  i was surpris how expens the self serv item cost and even more surpris to find out my pretzel mms were stale

not cooltacki and unrefinedbut im not talk about chicken wings


thi moroccan restaur has figur out a work busi model  they use the lack of other moroccan restaur in the area plus belli dancer plus interest decor all to distract custom from the sub par food and poor servic  

we did the 6 cours tast menu for 40  much of the food tast like it was sit out at a buffet and some unhappi waiter just brought it to our tabl  for the money that you will spend here you can actual go to a good buffet even though you may have to get the food yourself  

the mint tea at the end of the meal was heaven  it was sooth and left a veri pleasant tast on my palett which help distract from the other flavor that were there prior  


if your look for dinner and a show get some teppenyaki  if you want mediocr food while eat in what feel like a magic lamp i guess you found the right place  

there is noth magic about this lamp and no geni either  youv been warngross food and with the name like chin chin i shouldv known 

order the wor wonton noodl soup and yang chow fri rice

wor wonton noodl soup had a child hand serv of noodl in a salti msginfus water bbq pork was dri and the wonton were just a fail 

yang chow fri rice was wors mooshi rice cook in a pool of oil which give it a huge unappet shine and it was flavorless you actual had to add soy sauc  and everi asian know you shouldnt have to add soy sauc to food like that

2 star for decent servic waiter was nice enough to get a new batch of fri ricei came here for my out of town friend birthday celebr everyon in our parti was excit for a nice steak dinner 

i wasnt in the mood for steak so i order the lamb and so did one of my friend the lamb was the onli thing that salvag this review from be 1star the lamb was cook exact as we request the steak on the other hand were all total off the mark two of my friend order their filet medium one came out total overcook like a hockey puck the other medium steak was practic raw im a fan of the mediumrar prepar but this was extrem when my friend ask for it to be cook a littl more they sent it in and it still came back undercook he again had to request they cook it a littl longer the third time it came out overcook shocker

thi whole debacl was realli disappoint the birthday boy said he wish he had just gone to outback steakhouspf chang is that huge chain of formula corpor restaur hq in phoenix az that american seem to love they are found in near everyst now there are 32 in california alon 

i guess if you offer exot asian like food in a nice appoint dinner set charg more for it and give it more american name tast and peopl serv it america goe for it 

it realli is a sampl of faux region type chines like dish sichuan general chus or chos chicken cantones moo goo gai pan or use to be lemon chicken popular into orang chicken by panda express into sweet and sour slight spici orang chicken mandarin moo shoo pork and good old cantones fri rice 

to their credit they keep thing consist and they keep thing at a decent level if not authent servic attempt to be good but it is usual too crowd for anyon to notic 

after our group order the waitress show the condiment tray and ask how spicey we want our sauc there were 3 small bottl of chili sauc soy sauc and vinegar and 3 small dipdish of yellow mustard chili past and  soy sauc huh was she go to mix it for us i ask cant each of us make our own sauc like you would in ani chines restaur 

anyway if you want some asian flavor but want to pay more and not get authent food and need to wait for your tabl and be serv by young inexperienc caucasian smile cpkchilistgifoutback  type server go to pf chang if you realli like it and you dont think they have oversatur their potenti growth as a chain you might purchas some of there stock tooghetto robertosinvega right off twain  swenson

sam menu as everi locationsam food sad myself i like ground beef to be like a season maidrit not shred pot roast with no flavoring

too greasi and bland for my tastes

i prefer victor next doorthe boyfriend is go to kill me when he read this review becaus he love the dinner and he spent a lot of money on it but i was over unimpressed

w start off with the special chop salad i thought this was rather good but it was so drench in dress that i could bare distinguish the differ ingredi i tast bacon and i felt the lettuc but that about it 

i forgot the tabl bread is forgett yes it soft and cover in sesam seed but there was noth special about it besid the fact that it was a giant piec you had to break by hand and it left seed all over the tabl i love the whip butter howev it was fluffi and salti overal perfect and i could spread this on anyth and everything

w order the bone in ribey to share sinc we had a larg lunch when it came to the tabl some ladi mangl it she cut a 34 inch slit to ask us if it was cook proper we ask for medium rare and i saw a lot of whiteish meat but the bf gave his approv so we took it i want to let the steak sit for a minut but the ladi proceed to cut it in all sort of sloppi piec 

it was a massacr ive never seen anyth like it befor she first tri to separ it from the bone it was like she had never handl a piec of meat or a steak befor she was all over the place and splatter of meat juic were shoot around the tabl i dont know if ani of it hit us or our cloth but i saw stain appear on the white tablecloth all around 

it took her forev to separ the bone from the meat at one point i thought she was go to give up becaus she just couldnt get the job done the whole time i was stare at the knife and wonder if she had grab the wrong one or if it was dull or someth it was appalling

next she cut the steak into piec she said she want us to have equal share of each section of the steak we had four piec one with the 34 inch slit in it and then she decid one piec was bigger than the other so she cut off a piec of it and threw it to the other portion omg in the end there were five piec of mangl meat that were divid onto two plate are you kid me

th meat look bastard after this

when i bit into my portion it was to my surpris tough im not even exagger here it was realli tough for a 50 steak ive cook more tender rib eye bought from costco or from omaha onlin catalog and it wasnt anyth near medium rare it was quit possibl medium if not more done 

the flavor of the steak was good but most of that was due to over salt there is a lot of season on this meat so much so that it was hard to actual tast the steak i over salt my steak at home but im not buy realli expens cut what im look for in a pricey steak is textur tender and flavor past the salt i didnt get ani of these three if i had gotten this steak at sizzler or at anoth cheaper restaur id be ecstat dont get me wrong i am so critic becaus this was suppos to be the best steak ever and it fell short by a lot

th side were hit and miss i thought the mushroom were nice done and were burst with flavor i dont even like mushroom but i thought these were a nice pick the special green bean were also good the fame lobster mac and chees that everyon rave overwtf the piec of lobster were small and although it was creami it was more milki than cheesi it was extrem loos and runni in textur and the predomin flavor was the tast of the breadcrumb um no i had some the next morn cold and the congeal consist was slight more appetizing

overal the next time im in vega im go to look for steak elsewher in my humbl opinion it not worth the pricei had been crave indian food for a while now so i forc my man to come with me unfortun he is not a huge fan of indian cuisinew got here at 830 on a sunday night and there was just 1 other tabl besid us this place is locat in a pretti sketchi neighborhood but onc insid it not that bad 

we order 
the tandoori chicken dinner special tandoori chicken saag paneer mix veget 2595
the mix curri dinner special chicken tikka masala chicken sagwala chicken masala 2595 
dinner special also come with dal soup tradit veggi soup with delic spice lentil and choic of bread we got garlic naan  roti 
they also give you complimentari pappadum  chutney 
mango lassi free with checkin but they onli let us have 1 to share lol  tast like a sour mango yogurt milkshak lol

th food was just ok my favorit item was the chicken tikka masala the servic absolut suck even though there were 7 server just sit around no one even came to refil our water glass or check up on us even onc anyway after we left i start feel sick and when we arriv home i most definit was sick ewww i got food poison from there and spent the next day feel absolut miser the total bill was over 50 and the food qualiti was the same if not wors than a standard lunch buffet thank the lord i had a restaurantcom certif so we onli paid a littl over 37 but it was not worth get sick for i will stick to mount everest or tri mint next time blehhhhhhhh

hot tip indian lunch buffet are absolut the way to goi was realli disappoint in this westin hotel just off the strip in las vega 

you would think that westin one of the better brand of hotel in the starwood famili would go all out for their onli hotel and casino in las vega top shelf to attract both the busi travel who have learn to reli on westin level of servic and the casual travel who want a good hotel near the strip 

they miss on both

thi westin cant make up it mind between be a busi hotel and a vega hotel it has a veri small casino with 1 crap tabl a few tabl game and some slot but virtual nobodi play the crap tabl never open 

and the room are small and veri much busi like versus vega like in size decor and style 

and although westin has onli own this porperti for less than 6 year it is alreadi show age around the edg lose ani fresh or swank it might have had at open it just doesnt have a crisp feel like mani other westin in major citi have 

and right now the citi is do major construct work on this section of flamingo road so get in and out of here is a hassl 

if you want a busi hotel in vega i suggest you tri embassi suit on paradis and if you want a more resort like hotel that is reason tri the hilton grand vacat properti there are 3 in vega either can be had for under 150 or get those internet deal from the major casino hotel which are offer some great deal like the venetian midweek for 69 or mani other for under 100

at least i got 1 day of starpoint to add to my starwood spg accountwhen someon visit from anoth countri one of the first thing they want to see is rainforest cafe i recal go to my first one in illinoi at the age of 13 and think it was the coolestplaceev of cours our standard chang as we continu to be expos to new place peopl and flavors

so while we were in vega i decid to take my best friend to the rainforest cafe at mgm we tast their
 chimichacha
 chees sticks
 coastal calamari 
 lobster dip
 rainforestcaf theme margaritaesqu drinks

th coastal calamari was like rubber the chees stick chewi the chimichacha mediocr at best and had a strang slight bitter aftertast the lobster dip a hard one to screw up with respect to tast  it most chees with littl bit of lobster mix in the margaritaesqu drink were huge strong and sweet they werent bad but i was pretti much indiffer to them

i learn a long time ago that you dont go to a rainforest cafe for the food you go for the fun interior when youv got 1 visitor whove never been  dont have one near them or 2 kid to entertain 

what about the 150 more your pay than if you went to that other place consid it an admiss fee

not i grant them 2 becaus onc youv outgrown the omglikewhoa interior what you priorit is the foodahhh the rainforest cafe  it use to be so awesom when it was it own compani way back when but onc it was sold to landri it seem to just go down hill  the food qualiti went down and the price went up

th interior of the restaur is pretti cool though and whi it got an extra star from me  it has a replica of the sky with shoot star a waterfal huge tree and differ anim that come to life everi so often  if you have kid it is a realli fun place to take them at least onc  warn though some anim are realli loud and can scare kid if you are sit super close especi the gorilla  keep that in mind if you have skiddish kid 

the servic is pretti all over the place as well  i have been a coupl of time becaus out of town peopl alway want to go here ugh  sometim you get amaz servic and sometim it is simpli atroci  though i have bad luck with server so this is everywher nowaday  

the food is hit or miss as well  some thing are great like the pasta and the appet  and some thing are just blah like the seafood and steak  and of cours everyth is veri prici for what you actual get  

so if you have kid take them onc for fun but dont set your bar too highthis 5th generat cattleman from missouri find himself not impress with lawri the prime rib and their lunch offer let start from the top and work through the experi 

park ampl for lunch but for a 600 seat restaur it would be a littl tight dure prime time hour 

decor their websit claim an art deco appear but have spent a lot of time brush up on kansa citi art deco architectur which led me into a more expans studi or two im not an expert on art deco style but im not an amateur either count me among the peopl who are not impress with this locat style it was hohum and quit frank ive seen and experienc better 

servic slow and not impress i order the tuesday lunch special i never receiv my chili that i order that was part of the special anoth person at our tabl order extra food at the end of our meal to take back to the offic and it took an aw long time for it to arriv also i was not offer a refil on my ice tea either that someth i shouldnt have to ask for it simpli need to be taken care of especi at a restaur of this calib 

food i like the 4 bread choic but quit frank i was not impress with their side which lack adequ season and spice and then there the problem with the meat and where a cardin sin was commit i watch as it was carv in front of me the appear was good i brought it back to the tabl look forward to enjoy it 3 bite in and im like this is so disappoint it wasnt tender and it lack good flavor for a minut i was wonder if they had run out of qualiti meat and had substitut sysco cheapest product line instead i need to eat so i took a few more bite as to not offend the peopl i was with but it was extrem disappoint for a place with a name that say the prime rib on the sign that has 70 some odd year of provid food servic i was disappoint at the qualiti of food that end up on my plate the horseradish was a pleasant surpris though and the save grace that allow me to consum the sandwich and not leav with a growl stomach 

verdict not impress at all im thank i didnt have to foot the bill for this experi and im glad i got to experi a vega legend but lawri wont make my list of place i will have busi lunch at or take out of town guest to if i want to showcas the best of what las vega has to offer 

2 star im sorri but i cant be impress when one of their signatur item one of the thing they claim to do so well was so hard to consum and not enjoy i use the term cardin sini chose my word care 

bar the unexpect i wont be backthis review is overdu but sad i was less than impress with my experi hereand it was my birthday dinner dure a trip to vega we decid to enjoy a nice dinner out at the eiffel tower restaur and actual plan ahead so we made a reserv befor we got into town we call the restaur request a nice window seat and told them it was my birthday know this is a veri expens restaur we expect to have the same experi weve had at other expens restaur in vega among other citi we expect to be greet nice and for our reserv to be treat with some digniti when we show up for our restaur we immedi realiz that this restaur is more of a spectacl than the other fine dine option in the area they let anyon up into the restaur so it veri congest by the bar loud and anyth but special we gave our name for our reserv and the hostess lead us to our tabl as i mention we had made our reserv sever week in advanc and ask for a window tabl 

they gave us a window tabl but that end up be right next to a huge poll on the opposit side of the restaur that didnt overlook the bellagio fountain but instead the run down balli pool that was under construct it was also the smallest tabl in the entir restaur our love romant dinner on my birthday was turn into a disast veri fast we decid to ask the hostess if there was ani other tabl avail and they said possibl so we went to the bar to have a drink and wait for anoth tabl about 20 minut later they took us to anoth tabl this time it did have a view of the fountain but it was also right in front of the server station so we constant had server on our lap dure the meal after the cluster of get a tabl i bare rememb the food and while we still had a good time becaus we were togeth we wont be visit the eiffel tower restaur again for a fine dine experi in vega there are so mani other place with just as good of a view better ambianc and much much better servicon the naughti list

i cant realli express myself here the full extent 
what i will tell you is that the taco are over 200 each they tast better at pepe tacos

th locat is horribl there are alway peopl panhandl or want to sell you someth while you are tri to eat 

the staff is realli slow they dont pay attent to order i ask for one thing they gave me anoth 

they over charg me and didnt give a proper refund 

overal the insid look dirti just like the one on easter ave 
the owner if roberto robledo who is the owner of the eastern durango and a few more so far the onli locat i can recommend is warm spring and durangoi had a gift card and resist my initi instinct to head to the trust locat ive been to near the south outlet to come here instead bad idea 

we arriv around 315 and they were pretti empti despit that servic was slow and they seat everi subsequ parti all in one area with no breath space 

our server was nice but a littl on the slow side and refil on drink and bread were hard to come by we order befor sever other group seat near us and yet our meal were the last to arrive

th shrimp appet we order was sad skimpi for the hefti price tag my fella and i share a porterhous with bake potato for him and i ad a sweet potato on the side the steak game out dri but after wait so long we decid to just suck it up without send it back my mom chicken breast was dri as well

th best part about my meal was the sweet potato and that sad for a steak restaur even if it is a chaini had gone in here at about 10pm one night when i was crave cooki dough ice cream i got one scoop of that and also decid to get a scoop of their new green cheesecak flavor 

their flavor are realli tasti ill never downgrad them becaus of this 

but the pricesomg sinc when is a scoop of ice cream 250

the kid who scoop my ice cream was nice but was talk with the other girl who was there and not pay much attent to me i thought it was rude and bad custom servic anyway i paid almost 6 dollar for 2 scoop of ice cream and a cake coneridicul he did by the way mention to me in small talk that his owner is cheap and doesnt let them even have a littl free ice cream while workingwhich is the onli perk of work there im sure

i got some coupon for buy one scoop get the 2nd for 99cent so i got anoth crave a few day later and went back here 


where it went wrong

when i walk in i notic the pre pack quart i stoop down to look at them sinc they were at the bottom of the display freezer sudden this older asian woman walk right up on me stand there and goe um helloand continu to stare at me i thought it was weird but then realiz she was think she would come watch me sinc appar i look like someon who goe into baskin robbin bend down out of sight of the peopl behind the counter and stuff quart of ice cream into my small purs 

i ask her if everyth was okay and she repli cold yeeesss  i then ask her if the ice cream in the quart was the same exact thing as fresh scoop and of cours she repli no it slight differ formulaof cours it is becsus one scoop of that stuff is almost three dollar and one quart of this stuff is 450 make perfect sense

so i walk over to the counter where i patient stood back wait to be acknowledg again by either that snarki woman or the other person who work there there was anoth guy who walk in right when i did but he was still ask to sampl everi flavorand i was readi tri to obvious project the im readi lookfin after about three minut of not even be look at the old woman ask if i was readi and i told her what i want she scoop two veri small scoop of cooki dough i ask her if the cone were includ and she said yes but onli the plain i usual got chocol dip cake cone but i declin this time and opt for a cup 

when she put my ice cream on the counter for me she veri quick rung up a total of around 5 dollar for the two scoop while she clear saw me hold out my coupon to her i had to actual say again i have a coupon she grab it and liter took 12 a second befor say nono but and i knew she was tri to get out of accpet this coupon i knew she would give me a hard time with thisso i said noit not expir she continu scrutin the coupon with a fine tooth comb and darnfound no object she reluct enter the coupon and gave me a correct price 

then just sinc she was so pleasant about it alli ask her if i could actual have a coneand she repli noyou get a cup or cone not bothfunni becaus everi time i have ever gotten ice cream they put it on a cone for me and then upon check out i alway rethink that it will probabl end in disast in my car while im drive home and i ask for them to toss is in a cup for me no problemusu 

so i was deni a cone wowi ask her okay well how much for a cone thenthirti five cents

coolnot cool

dig through my purs for 35 cent   oh no i am actual onli abl to locat a quarter in my pursei look at her and said i will be right backi need to get a dime out of my car she said noth and stare at me i went and got the dime came back in and toss it on the counter along with the quarter

y  i could have just sum everyth up with horribl custom servic cheap owner rude staff tasti overpr ice creambut i think that explain the fight she put up with me just becaus i had a coupon and decid to get a 35 cent conepicki franchis owner great menu of choic and special but high mediocr food at best  when you claim to featur greek italian persian middl eastern indian and vegetarian dishesyou have the potenti to be master of none  success  this unfortun is what theyv becom  ive been a few time to tri differ item kebab pasta otherand final and last straw was when i sent back my plate 3 time   im done with paymons

 never tri their hookah but ive walk thru the separ room from the dine side and it absolut gorgeous  great light beauti artwork and wellventil  for local it could be a great night out with the bud or a date  but  make sure you get this it not vega  it nice loung but you can pickitup and placeitdown in anytown usa  park is easi no hassl in the privat lot no valet necessary

in the end hookah win but the food is middleoftheroad148 review averag 45 star cant go wrong right  that was what i thought  befor you start cuss at me for not know fine food pleas understand that i am just give my honest opinion pure on our din experi  it could be that we order the wrong food or simpli this is just not my type of restaur  

i had bookmark rosemari restaur for more than a year  as often as i come to vega i hadnt made it here until last monday 112309  the restaur is in a strip mall  from the exterior it unassum but the interior decor and atmospher make this place cozi and charm  

we arriv 20 minut earli than our reserv but were seat quick  2 assist server came to introduc themselv and who our server would be  servic was veri attent too attent to the point that i actual felt uneas  the assist server walk around and check on us so often as if we were be rush to finish our food so they can take the plate which they had ask a coupl of time if we were done and if they could take the plate  no not yet  

we order the following

appet  hugo texa bbq shrimp with maytag blue chees slaw 1450  this was excel  the shrimp were grill to perfect with the right smoke flavor  the slaw was creami and crunchi  5 stars

entre  brick chicken with haricot vert shoestr potato  dijonnais sauc 30  i had the oven brick chicken at the at last cafe in long beach and it was so good that i thought id tri it here at the rosemari  i took one bite and it was noth like at last cafe  the skin was not crispi and the meat tast mushi  by mushi i meant it almost seem it got filler in it  while the skin tast salti the meat itself tast sweet  it was just a realli weird combin  i also didnt care for the shoestr potato  it didnt add anyth to the chicken other than the present and were realli hard to eat  

mi fianc had roast filet of beef and horseradish soufflé potato onion marmalad hydropon watercress  bourbon green peppercorn sauc 40  this was a huge disappoint  the beef was tasteless  even the sauc fail to add ani more flavor to it  

i got a phone call from the restaur to see how everyth was  i think the ladi expect me to rave about the food  unfortun i had to tell her it was disappoint  mayb ill give it anoth tri next time or mayb notwhat happen when you dine at a fair nice restaur when your underdress in the case of panevino you get poor servic and a forgett dine experi a spontan dinner plan for my wife kid and myself result in us come here after our first few option were busi ill admit i look like crap with old jean with hole and a raggedi flannel shirt that slight homeless look lead to our server direct us to the back page of the wine list with all the cheap stuff with the item we would be comfort with i know i look bad but i thought i look better than the guy at the bar wear a track suit

th meal start out ok with two small crab cake bread on the outsid and top with two delici sauc dinner took a sharp turn south with the hummus roll it sound interest and even look good unfortun it had an odd smokey flavor and an aftertast that had me reach for my wine and bread to cleans my palat my wife had the filet lay on a bed of mash potato and smother in a thick mushroom sauc it wasnt the best grade of beef for my entre i went with the short rib risotto the deep and savori flavor of the chunk of beef were satisfi but the grain of rice had a soft mushi overcook textur dessert were slight better they get point for send out a complimentari strawberri shortcak two layer of light crispi puff pastri sandwich a layer of strawberri we also follow it up with a chocol souffl that came out unusu quick bake to order probabl not but the rich dens chocolatey dessert with chocol ice cream wasnt bad ani dessert overload with chocol will typic get a posit reaction from me

th place is romant and intim with a nice view of the airport and the strip in the background unfortun the food wasnt on par with the atmospher and the servic made the experi even less enjoy if i ever return it will most like be to eat at their cafe for lunchrex is not a man of compromis it isnt to say that rex hasnt tri rex has dont believ rex call rex a liar rex onli lie befor sex still not satisfi demand proof smart veri smart rex doe the same thing and sinc dna is onli 9999999 accur rex still has no offici heir to his empir  314 win and no defeat rex is good  enough braggingproof you wantproof you shall have  compromis number 1  in singapor rex want to cut off michael fay hand and sew them to his knee the govern want to let him go we compromis rex cane that littl punkand kick him while he was on the ground cri  compromis number 2  rex want mr rodger to complet strip down and put on an entir new outfit the prude at pbs said that he shouldnt disrob at all for a kid show we compromis rex recommend shoe and sweatera star was born  last compromis  when work as a legisl in a southern state mani of my constitu want to pass a law that allow them to marri their daughtersno matter how young or old rex want to castrat all of them and throw their penis in a rage fire so they can never be use again we compromis now in virtual everi southern state you can marri your cousin at a veri young age  rex can and will compromis  

onc again rex compromis  a person who dare to call himself a friend rex call him an agent of the govern sent to watch over him suggest that we go to round tabl pizza  rex suggest that he lay down in traffic and wait for the pain to end we compromis rex was abl to huff gas right out of his tank he paid and rex ate


when you first enter round tabl pizza the smell is surpris good  almost like good pizza  rex and his government guardian got the all you can eat and drink soda not beer or ammonia you cant even drink your own ammonia and settl down for our feast they give you two plate one for the salad bar the second for the pizza the booth are uncomfort and tight   everi gentleman know that the first cours is the salad cours rex walk over to the salad bar and it was just all right noth wrong with it noth wonder noth memor  they had veri good shred chees and excel real bacon four or five dress some other top not bad rex sit down clear his throat for eight or nine minut blow two snot rocket and is readi to eat  as expect the salad was okay  it wasnt offens and for the price rex didnt pay it was better than some salad bar for more moneyand they dont have pizza  the ranch dress was abov averag not a bad start

rex reluct walk up to the pizza window  there were two fresh bake pizza and one that look like it was made the year betti white lost her virgin  rex took a few slice and sat down fulli prepar to rais hell  sad rex was not total correct in his assumpt  the pizza while not great pizza and if you made it in new york citi someon would have you kill wasnt horribl  the first slice was a white chicken pizza with jalapeno  shock good rex was stun the second slice was a standard pepperoni and sausag with red sauc  this is where the wheel start to fall off  the red sauc is not good it tast like can sauc you get on sale for 50 cent at some discount food store  it had no real tast except for dri herb and a littl acid  the sausag was dread no tast except for pepper and the pepperoni was bland  rex was unhappi so he spit that crap onto the floor and went up for a coupl more slice  the white pizza with chicken bacon and tomato was veri good and the mushroom pizza with red sauc was dread over cook mushroom no flavor  

the one thing that should be said is that rex has a huge johnson  the other thing that should be said is that the crust is surpris good it is veri butteryoili but in a good way it get crispi and has a decent taste

round tabl pizza is exact what it should be it is a low cost option for peopl who dont know or can afford a good pizza it is quick easi and cheap the food isnt great but it realli isnt offens either if you havent live in the northeast of the unit state you have no clue what good pizza is anyway so whi spend more money on what is sure to be crap  get a salad a drink and some pizza that is slight better than frozen pizza for under 10 buck fill your facesnoth will make you forget rex noth will ever make that dna test  will never be 100 accur  hear the kid scream hear rex run of cours you dontrex is long goneive got to add border grill to my list of top chef master restaur that disappoint it join a coupl other spot ive had the misfortun of visit zentan by susur lee in washington dc and rick moonen rm seafood room here in vega ive been to border grill three time now and either the qualiti has slip or my expect have risen becaus with each visit i leav less satisfied

w decid to come here for a famili night out  yup we had the kid in tow and were look for a familyfriend spot that would make him happi and have good enough food to make us happi they get point for have a kid menu and they also have a glutenfre menu for anyon look for that unfortun the food didnt thrill ani of us

th plantain empanada 9 are fill with a mixtur of roast plantain black bean poblano pepper and cotija chees the sweet of the plantain domin the flavor of the dish i love plantain so that isnt necessarili a bad thing just an observ the empanada dough was more mushi then flaki which was a disappoint there are four per order so plan to share

th baja cevich 15 is a huge order of lime marin halibut and shrimp sit on a corn tortilla with slice avocado sit on top there was too much lime and the fish didnt tast all that fresh this also seem like a dish that was mass produc and was probabl sit around in those lime juic for quit some time

th first entre to make it way to the tabl was someth off of their special menu it was shrimp stuf with crab and wrap in bacon with some sort of cilantro pesto sauc or someth i cant rememb exact 26 it sound awesom but it turn out to be a hot mess too much bacon no detect crab in or near the shrimp and a million ingredi that overcompl the dish

th negro modelo brais short rib 29 were much better it came with two larg chunk of boneless beef atop corn polenta and a cherri tomato salsa fresca with a molass habanero bbq sauc the beef could have been more tender but the flavor were pretti good with a slight bitter from the negro modelo and sweet from the sauc it wasnt over spici 

the kid chees quesadilla 4 was fill with cotija chees i think fine for adult but for a 3 yr old with develop tast bud no he wasnt a fan too bad they didnt just have a cheddarmonterey jack chees blend

our littl guy did get a scoop of chocol ice cream 3 accompani with fresh berri he love the ice cream but is still learn to like berries

th wife and i split the flourless chocol cake with prick pear lyche sauc and raspberri 10 it was heavierdens than we expect but still rich and chocolatey the crust and bottom of the cake were slight overcook and hard

along with mediocr food we had spotti servic our server was friend but veri busi and disappear often this isnt fine dine but at the price they charg they could step thing up a bit littl thing like clear empti dish and replac silverwar would make a big differ the whole atmospher was more laid back then i rememb the last time we were here was probabl 2 year ago it almost felt like a small step up from a chevi fresh mex or one of those type of place they also charg fifti cent for water per person although my son didnt get water they charg him anyway  

anoth thing that was annoy was how they decid to sit peopl right next to us when most of the dine room was complet empti whi not space peopl out more

it was a pricey meal for what we got but at least we were arm with a restaurantcom gift certif we also tri to use the border grill vip card which normal get us a 15 discount but manag said they couldnt take both the gift certif and vip cardthe steak in my taco were drown in saucemarinadedrown  of cours i got through it and ate everi bite i alway do but definit not worth 28  that right you heard me 28 for three mediocr taco  i dont think ani taco is worth 28ever  what possess me to order those  hunger doe strang thing to the mind  not worth it and i was mad all night that i ruin my dinner on the so not worth it 28 tacoyelper elnino f and i came for nom and left disappoint 

appetizers
soft shell crab big good and veri crisp panko breading
sashimi salad spici and tangi veri generous big portion of mix fish most tuna salmon though
saba grill saba was pretti decent

rol 
no name recommend and popular i order a half and the guy gave me a whole roll i wouldnt have mind if it was good but it was sauc flavor and not much els it had just one piec of tempura surround by too much ricesoy paper thin slice of fish outsid and a lot of sweet sauc mayo and crunchi there wasnt a marriag of flavor here with the ingredi just sauc and rice

 i dare to get no more roll but tri a few piec of elnino and the roll were just about the sauc all roll are cali spici tuna tempura base or mayo scallop and i was hope for more fish base roll 

nigiri 
yellowtail it was okay and not as freshflavor as i hoped
albacor this was serious fuck disgust it was mushi and fell apart in my mouth wtf ive had some mediocr piec in ayc but this fish was serious mishandl in defrost to get such a bad mouth feel
mackerel  this was fine and good so i order a bunch of this
salmon this was alright as far as salmon goe 
eel good but that pretti standard eel from a packag so how can you screw up

they slice the fish big but the rice was also big it wasnt proport ratio of rice to fish on most order  i do not like that everyth was preslic as that also affect the textur of fish if it isnt use right away the rice was warm as it should but too warm that some of the more delic fish becom warm with it and doesnt make for the optim flavor or mouthfeel of what nigiri is firmcool fish marri with a light warm fluffi rice 

servic was decent the server were on the refil of drink and our server was nice and made suggest at the begin to let us know that popular we were check on and ask sever time if they can put ani appet order the sushi men were busi but order came out in a reason amount of time a few thing were forgotten but probabl good sinc the rice was fill and i was order like i would at ani other joint one thing that bother me as we were sit and wait on our first order i was talk to elnino about my favorit sushi spot and the sushi guy chime in how it  is no good and defend how their is way better that bother me as they werent ask to be in the convo and most import it didnt deliv competit on the fresh and fair rice ratio 

i was think hard about the rate but this is definit a place i wont return to the albacor was the worst ive ever had and i cant shake off how unappet it was to continu after that piec i like to have varieti but i was put off and stuck to mackerel as it was the onli thing i knew was good 

i had this on my must tri base on some rave review from yelper friend but i look back and i see that most of those were from over a year ago someth must have chang yes the price peopl keep talk about but serious 2295 isnt realli that much of a price discount from most 2695 place that for the 4 are much better this place was pack but it was most roll type peopl and colleg kid there isnt a good ayc nearbi as competit either 

im with anna s dont believ the hypereal sushi lover let be honest  yama is not that good  i know a lot of friend who think yama is the best sushi in town and to each his own  but in my opinion yama just isnt good

th restaur is small  the servic is absolut horrend  i never know who is my actual server or who to order anyth from  theyr super strict on their ayc rule  and the fresh and qualiti of ingredi are question  

i love bake roll and i love cream chees  and when i order a bake roll and it come out room temp the cream chees isnt even melt in and the roll fall apart when i start pick it up with my chopstick im just sad

iv given yama multipl chanc to prove me wrong but each time i decid to go back they just reaffirm that theyr just not that good  no chang in servic no improv in qualiti of food  just an overal sad experi  it not the absolut worst ive ever had but it still veri sad

sav yourself the troubl and go somewher els if your a real sushi lover look for qualiti roll fresh ingredi and a great experiif you like to eat all the rice on your sushi and can eat more than 25 buck worth of sushi then come here fyi there is no sashimi

i didnt do much research befor come i just heard allyoucaneat sushi and i said im down but i regret it after go there and saw all the rules

i know most all you can eat sushi place do have the rule of charg unfinish food but this place strict enforc it

our waitress act like a bitch right from the start we felt like we were be stare down there were also time where she obvious stop at our tabl to look at our un eaten rice on our plate she also check all our plate for uneaten food right in front of us it felt like i was be check for illeg item at the tsa secur line which make our meal there veri uncomfortable

th food there was ok they do have uni and sweet shrimp one per person sweet shrimp is onli 1 piec per person qualiti was up to par certain chef put ton of rice on the roll 

honest i should have spent my money at one of the better buffet on the stripim not sure if we just caught this place on a bad day or what happen but the servic was unbear aw i do have a few good thing to say so let start with that 

the food was great we had the athen fri and dolma appet my friend also had the mozz stick and said they were good i was total impress by the dolma dish tender grape leav stuf with angus ground beef tomato and rice in a tangi tomato sauc ive been crave them ever sinc the fri are delici too coat in some kind of season with a side of this creami aoli sauc that sauc you could put on tree bark and i would be good great happi hour deal 50 off all appet and signatur drink the lyche martini was pretti good as well
th hookah flavor were great as well we tri blueberri vanilla with a touch of cinnamon tast like french toast so amaz ill be come back specif for that 
now into the bad unfortun this complet out weigh the good first i say down im the hookah loung part for about 25 minut with no menu and no recognit at all i final went up to the bar where the waitress was and ask if she could stop by she held up her finger and said one minut in a veri snappi tone mind you the loung was not that busi at this time i sat back down and about 15 minut she came over after i wave my hand at her i order a glass of wine  ask if it was on happi hour she said yes the rest of my parti arriv a few minut later  we all sat there for about 30 minut with no servic and still no wine for me one of my friend approach the bartend to order the rest of our drink and he said they would be brought out to us after wait 20 minut and see our drink just sit there on the bar i got up and brought them over when i was at the bar retriev them i told our waitress we would like to order she got out a pen  paper and said what would you like i was t sure of the exact order everyon want so she told me to go ask them and she would be at the comput when i was prepar to order now in all the year of experi of dine out or work in restaur in general i was blown away by this she actual want me to go get the order of our tabl and walk back to the bar to order while take my drink as well wow not cool bro
th hookah chic was no help either she kept forget the flavor and had to ask us sever time what we order and to top it off i had 6 glass of wine over the period of our 4 hour dinner and when we got the bill not one glass was offer at happi hour when i ask about this this was her respons oh i didnt ring up ani of your wine until the end and it 10pm now 
 such a disastr experi if the food  wasnt so amaz id never return but sinc it is ill give paymon one more shot but if i receiv servic like this again my next review wont be as nice get it togeth peopli wasnt too impress with their food  the sushi were wide in circumfer and thin slice  that combo is just a disast wait to fall apart when you pick them up with your chopstick  after eat a few piec we final said someth to the waiter  we even show her what happen when you pick it up mayb the rice wasnt made correct or made not tight enough  she look at us as if we were crazi  so the best thing she could do for us was to remak one roll bc the other roll were half way eaten  

im not sure if was due to the crazi hectic valentin holiday or if that just the way they make some of their roll   i was so caught up in pick up the sushi in piec that i lost focus on qualiti and tast of the fish   

ive been to mani sushi place in town and ill have to say  ive had betterthis is not nobus not close 

it is not some 100person high end sushi restaur at one of the higher end hotel on the las vega strip no way

you know that sushi you buy in the deli section to take home from safeway 

that is probabl a lot closer 
sou desu translat that right

thi sushi restaur is within a block of unlv so what do student valu 

cheap food

so this place special in notsogood but fair cheap sushi 

it is korean own of cours but it has been here for mani year so somebodi come here regular my guess is starv student who want to splurg on sushi befor or after final  

or if you blew all of your money at the tabl or slot at that glitzi strip casinohotel then you probabl have to tighten your belt and come here for sushi right 

you can get enough to eat for 20 here

that will get you one dish at nobusi would like to make this clear from the start we have eaten here a few time and the food is pretti good as a brit live in vega there are time i get the crave for some good old british food today was one of those days

on one of our trip to the uk i introduc the wife to the british carveri to give you an idea take a look here  httpwwwtobycarverycoukcarvery

now as these are non exist in vega we are left with place that serv a tradit british sunday dinner right crown and anchor it is

th servic is alway good here the wait staff are alway friend and quick and let be honest here whoever came up with their uniform you deserv a medal

but it is the food we are interest in

th wife went for the sunday dinner with roast beef i had the sunday dinner with lamb and beef both dish are serv with yorkshir pud veg and a roast potato more on those in a minut along with this my wife order a small hous salad

aft a while we had pretti much given up on the salad no big deal these thing do happen howev when are meal came out they each had a hous salad on the plate along with the meat potato veg yorkshir pud and gravy

a pet peev of mine is when waitstaff know that someth isnt right how a hous salad with gravi even make it out of the kitchen is beyond me unless this is the way the owner want it in which casewow

anyway a quick recoveri by the ladi serv us my salad which i did not order is gone and my wife has a nice hous salad on the side which would have been better serv befor the meal came out but ok on to the meal itself

i it a tradit british sunday dinner well yeah it is in the same way that as a mcdonald 14 pounder is a gourmet burger all the piec are correct it look right but there is just someth missing

so let us dissect the meal 

the meat were good mayb a littl thin slice but that happen to be the way i like them so i was happi howev put beef gravi on to lamb just destroy ani tast to the meat if you are go to offer both meat it actual better to serv the gravi on the side and let the custom mess it up

th yorkshir pud was good this is someth that normal caus all kind of issu to those not rais with the darn thing but they were good

veg is veg enough said and ignored

now for the real crime on this dish the roast potatothi is go to be long it is a stori and a rant

th great british roast potato a food that when done right make a brit smile and a non brit wish they had been born a brit sound like exagger huh  

a coupl of year ago we were lucki enough to host the famili christma dinner here it seem like half of california show up the women folk work their wonder on the veg the father in law work on turkey and prime rib

ov in a corner of the kitchen the brit who marri into the famili was hide in a cloud of steam gentl giggl to himself these poor american had no idea what was about to hit them a bag of potato had been boil cut in half and were now be gentl rock back and forth in a colander

th women were look at the wife wonder wtf did you go and marri this guy for  and whi wont he answer ani question about what he is cook 

45 minut befor we are due to eat the potato are place in the oven set at 325 bast in a bath of melt lard and drip after 15 minut the oven door is quick open the potato are quick cover with the oil 15 minut later the door is again open and the potato are turn over

so 45 minut pass what come out is a potato that is golden brown on the outsid with a crisp to it while insid the potato is light and fluffi and total ignor by everyon  heret 

that is until the father in law becom brave and decid to tri one of these strang thing his new son in law has produc or it could of been his daughter kick him under the tabl while not so subt nod at the bowl of potato but he tri one then ever so slowli reach over and grab the bowl and shovel a bunch of them on to his plate the famili is shock the strang new food is a hit with the old man the brit sit back with a littl smile on his face

now the reason for that long stori is if you are go to serv roast potato serv roast potato not two littl bit of potato that if i had to guess came out of a bag frozen were quick thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served

y do it right is time consum yes it can be a bit of a pain but if a chain in the uk can do it day in and day out serv thousand of meal a dayther is no reason whi a littl restaur cannot get such an import part of the meal right
for this reason and this reason alon they get mark down is that mean well no it notim general a walmart support but this locat was a test of my peopleofwalmartcom identif skill  terribl layout small and cramp and far too few lane open to accommod 12 of the peopl in attend  conveni to one of my two offic it will suffic but futur stop will be few and far betweenif the cigarett smoke doesnt get youyou have eye of asbestos

w walk in and near walk thru to the back that how small this place is it feel as if someon wall up the other half of the space that should be here and how weird is the rotat water wheel it did draw your attent but had no real purpos the seat is that crappi shag 70s white fenc awkward booth thing that is super irritating

also we were not quit threaten to order someth but the guy said the booth were for food purchas and well you know blah blah not veri friend though the waitress who came over onc the entertain start was veri nice yin and yang go on there

for food it is deep fri everyth and the drink seem over price i dislik the minuscul space for perform that is shove in the corner 

but to give prop where due the entertain have this cool jazzi jam session thing go on friday night that is a notch abov what the decor would have you expect so score one for the perform i would say this is the onli thing that save this from rate a one

unfortun we i miss a guest perform becaus we had to step out and breath deep the clean vega air for a littl while 

and no i didnt tri the hamburg everyon els tri so no comment there

for a blast into the cigarett reeki past of the 70s you cant go wrong but if you want a decent cozi jazz place go to lot of other place that do it betterso now that i am the second one to review the cinco de mayo massacr i will sail away in the boat of asshol with matthew c i understand cinco de mayo is like a nation holiday for drink and eat lard fill mexican food but holi frijol this place was ridicul  as far as i know one of our fearless leader call and made prior arrang for seat for our group well by the look of it they reserv the wait area for us and forgot that we want to eat  

mi night start off crappi after stand at the bar tri to get the attent of the ladi work the bar for about 20 minut befor leav the bar empti hand and frustrat we then final got seat and the waiter ask us what we want to drink we order  margarita in hope we would be put into a tequila coma and that was not the case it was like pound a bottl of margarita mix hold the tequila 

next misti y  was awesom enough to hook the tabl up with the tabl side guac and i happen to be sit with a group of other hot and spici fan so we ask for our bowl to be hot i think they took the lead of the person make the margarita and kept out the main ingredi jalapeno 

so by this point it was damn near sei de mayo and they took our order we all put our order in at the same time and i will say that all the food came out quick well almost all the food matt c was sit to my right with noth on the tabl in front of him we all tri to get the attent of the waiter and when they final listen to us we said he did not get his food the waiter said okay let me go get it about 10 minut later we had to stop him again and this time he had to ask matt what he had order and basic start this process all over again horrible

y i did open the door for them to earn anoth star back from us in which they did but i am glad matthew c did not end up with a chip tooth or someth wors 

i will not be back to this locat esto era horribl y nunca voy a estar de vueltastop in for a quick bite to eat as i was run veri late to meet friend i normal avoid place like this but when you are in a hurri and your option are limit ya do what ya gotta do 
 
the drive thru line was too long so i went insid i figur id get the two cheeseburg deal sinc they look small and easi to eat while drive the custom servic was ok and the food came out pretti quick almost too quick  place seem clean i dont realli feel it fair to remov star base on me not like fast food this is definit as good as i expect it to be which isnt much

th first issu that i thought was a littl weird while i was wait for my food a father and son came up to order more food the father ask if she had a side of fruit for his son she repli no when she walk away i told him that it look like they had appl slice in the kid menu when she came back he ask her and she said that they did have those last i check appl slice were still fruit but whatev he ask how much and she said someth like 50 cent or a dollar then he ask how mani came in that serv and she said 2 we both assum she meant 2 slice so he order like 34 when she gave him the 34 bag they easili had 46 slice in each bag so i wasnt over impress with her knowledg of the menu and felt that she didnt realli seem to be invest in ensur that she was give out the correct inform this guy didnt realli look like he was on a budget but still he definit didnt seem to need all of those appl for one small child  
mi second issu is that i ask for my cheeseburg without onion and when i got in the car and open up the wrapper both burger were cover in chop onion that were basic imposs to easili remov boo
im assum i wont be back until the next time im desper for a quick food fix  whi cant five guy have a drive thru window sad facesorri john your hous look veri tradit but that about it your food was veri far from authent and sad dissappointing

disguis by waitstaff dress in tradit cloth and abuelita make tortilla a manolik nasti lindo michoacanbarf sound

john hous build your anticip up onli to let you down in the end
so we got the guacamol to start wifey order the mole de pollo and i order the chile rellenochicken enchilada combin plate

guacamoleth version that i whip up at the yelpmaz race in under a minut tast better and horchata is from the machin not homemade

chil rellenoon of my benchmark for authent no stringi cheesi good but a weird brownovercook firm chees that had a textur like a veri firm tofu in a bare intact chile held by a bunch of toothpick veri disappointinghow bout a throwdown bobbi flay styleenchilada was aight

chicken molewer expect bonein chicken piec but instead fricken chicken fajita strip doubl as the meat for the mole even worse
th spice sweet and smoki from the sauc tast kinda off with a tangi like a barbecu sauce

unfinish entre and total dissappoint a strong fishi odor permeat the dine room from a fri fish that was be deliv to the tabl next to usfeel sorri for that next victim
it was time for us to say adio for goodalohabeware

it pain me to write this review but if i can get one person to avoid the mistak we made tonight it make this yelp review worthwhil  this place use to be a stapl for my wife and me everi vega visit but we will never come here again  we are disappoint that we have to find a new sushi place to come to but this place is definit not it anymore

sushi mon chang ownership recent and it realli show  the cute japanes ladi is no longer at the cash regist  the new ownership charg the same price but everyth good about this place has gone

th nigiri now come with huge piec of rice  if you are a rice connoisseur this place is for you  it a shame what the new manag is tri to pull  on top of that the fish is not fresh

mi wife order a spici scallop handrol and it was overflow with imit crab  i argu with the sushi chef and he open the handrol up and show us the 2 piec of scallop hidden in the bed of imit crab  really

th present of the salmon skin handrol look like a kindergarten art project  

the sushi chef are inexperienc and cant get the sauc right  the roll are either too salti or fall aparthave a 14 year old son mean a lot of trip to fast food joint and this one is in our neighborhood  this one is not one of our favorit joint  the food qualiti here is subpareven by fast food standard  the beef never tast fresh and the bread seem a littl old at times

w decid we wouldnt eat here anymor becaus it that bad  there are 1000s of other fast food joint to choos fromi live nearbi and have liter pass by this place 1000s of time  today was the day to take it off the to do list  i drop in around 1130 am just befor the lunch rush  it is locat in an outdoor food court in a busi mall and has a hand of tabl insid with communiti tabl outsid on the patio  it casual fast food dine so dont worri about dress up

aft brows the menu i decid to order the gyro time 695 and the falafel pocket 595 with a bottl of watertot damag with tax 1553 ouch  this was without ani sides

aft a short wait my order was brought out by the cashier  a small side of hummus and tzatziki sauc  i dove into the gyro first  it was full of gyro meat  onion  the pita was nice and moist but the meat was bland to me  despit put the tzatziki sauc on it it was still lack flavor  i was hungri so i finish it  next up was the falafel pocket  it was stuf with falafel tomato onion and cucumb  i use the hummus and remain tzatziki sauc with the falafel pocket  i like it better than the gyro  the falafel had a nice flavor to it and it went well with the toppings

overal i was underwhelm by the experi and flavor of their food  for the price i paid for the food i expect much more

wil i return  nopenotic this place when in the area for gelato and fish taco but review made it sound pretti dismal im not realli an ayc sushi person and not have a websit list or menu in the photo made me hesit to visit
hesit wasnt unwarr it turn out

went in to order takeout opt for the rolli roll and the pink ladi roll
sat at the sushi bar next to an ayc patron as i wait he order and receiv 3 differ roll this began to get annoy as i wait near 20 minut for my order restaur wasnt busi onli two other tabl were in and neither was activ order one other person was wait on a takeout order and wait longer than i did
what realli irrit me was realiz that my order sat at the counter for a good 10 minut befor the older waitress notic and brought it to me
and then i had to remind her to charg my card befor i left servic needless to say is lacking

food was okay
rolli roll was one of those round mound of mix rice and fish im not a huge fan of that type of roll and though there was noth wrong with the flavor i was annoy that the nontradit roll structur was not mention on the menu when i ordered
pink ladi roll was just okay sauc did not tast like ani garlic ponzu ive had and the salmon almost tast cook rather than fresh disappointno bueno the servic was okay no smile or friend attitudes

th cashier was more interest in talk to some guy i assum a friend who had show up i cant stand when peopl dont do their job and would rather social instead your get paid for a servic so give it

th blizzard were delici like alway got to love the buy 1 get the 2nd for 99 cent we also got the new strawberri chocol sunda which was heavenly

not come back to this dqwe were in the mood for salad and a coupl roll but instead of go to our usual place nake fish we decid to tri a new place we were hope kobe sushi would be good sinc it close to the hous but we were pretti disappointed
for what it is the price are a littl high if your plan on order a la cart so i suggest you go elsewher we both decid to get the ayc 2399 sinc it would basic add up to that much anyways

i notic the ayc menu is pretti limit compar to other place so that was the first red flag next they dont offer uni or fresh scallop for ayc they were also out of oyster and halibut they do howev offer sashimi 2 piec per person but they are cut veri small our first plate of nigiri tast ok but everyth after that did not tast fresh ugh noth wors than raw fish that tast like raw fish lol they put a lot of rice on the nigiri too and i notic my rice kept fall apart which made it hard to eat i like that they had soft shell crab on the menu it small though and i enjoy their sweet shrimp nigiri but the shrimp head were underfri 

the waitress and busser were nice but the food took forev to come out even though we were 1 of 3 parti in the restaur the sushi qualiti just wasnt good i didnt even ask if they had a stamp card so it safe to say i probabl wont be back here  


hot tip they have happi hour 50 off the menu on friday  saturday after 500skip the sushi and stick to cook food and rolls

w had just come from watch a movi and were starv we were look for some quick and cheap grub and i rememb this kobe locat that was near us i have been to the one on rainbow on numer time but this was my visit here i knew they have a happi hour that pretti much last all day so it made our decis easi

our food came quick the portion were larg and i was happi with most of the cook thing in my bento box the katsu was pretti good and not overcook the salad was pretti fresh as well my fella didnt enjoy his roll so i end up trade a major of my bento box for his roll sinc i like it better than he did the spici tuna was spici but not as fresh and fell apart quit easili the sashimi was not fresh at all the flavor was realli fishi and i end up not eat this portion of my meal my friend and fella were pretti meh about the dine experi as well the price were right but i dont think ill be back to this kobe locatso we went to check hikari out as suggest by a co worker of minea a pay custom and a chef in the industri tast is everyth my cowork mention ayc sashimi and raw oyster so that is what i tri first the sashimi was pretti decent so we ask for two order of oyster think they were gonna come like nigiri2 per order becaus it take time to shuck raw oysterson of the chef yell to the backtwo dozen oyster my wife and i look at each other think we didnt say dozen we realli thought that they were be funni but no more than 510 second later two dozen are hand to usbig red flagther is noth more simpl than a perfect shuck oyster plump full with all is juic and most import free from the second muscl that hold the oyster in place these oyster were none of that with the sunken in preshuck look you would see in a buffet total disguis by the green onion ponzu and hot sauc  some were even stab in half by the oyster knife and still clung to the shell becaus of that muscl on the bottom be in a open kitchen atmospher is great for the sushi chef to be abl to interact with the guest but that doesnt mean you have to sacrific the qualiti and integr of your ingredi so as the night progress we tri their uni amaebi super white tuna etc all okayi see hamachi kama on the menu and i prepar to order that after i finish their less than impress frallop rubberi calamari and hikari express roll with ton of crab filler and their ghetto version of dynamit this kid sit next to me order the collar and so i sit back to see what it look like again when i order hamachi kama i expect to wait at least 10 minutesnot more than 1 minut later the kid order arriv again with the pre done warm up look anoth red flag i guess the sushi chef rather save time for their comed antic out front and it show the kid had this gross out unappet look and his mom hand it back to the waitress say he didnt like itw finish the even with some green tea ice cream and mango sorbet which wasnt includ with ayc if you want quantiti over qualiti this place is for you also if you plan on throw down on sashimi and substandard oyster this seem to be their hook i notic that there also an event here tomorow nighthav fun and if there futur plan for anoth sushi social at my stomp groundssushimon on silverado ranch andfmaryland pkwi ill be glad to meet up with all you fellow yelper limit menu dessert not includ and worst of all predon food is a big nono in my ayc bookalohaive been here a few time and each time i didnt like the job they did my car is alway relat clean so if i bring it to a car wash it probabl becaus i was to lazi to dust off the littl dust i may have had or some hand print from my passeng who dont know how to grab just the door handl 

i was here onc last summer  im sure after the automat car wash the guy wipe down the car tri his best  he had a big smile seem out of breath and was think he did a great job so i felt like i didnt have to walk around but i did and all i saw was bug and dirt splat all over the front still and spot all over the car  i was like what the hell  of cours i ask if he could wipe those miss spot and he did but it was still not that great  i even had a big hand print on the front windshield yea i thought freddi wasnt that fabul as advertis  there was even a guy sell chip windshield repair servic there and ff let him do his busi there still noticeable

 
fast forward to this year  after swear off come back i was out of gas and someon had pressur me into go back becaus they were good  came in for an all out clean of everyth terribl result  i have dark interior so if you miss a spot ill see it  white mark over the interior door it was there befor so id figur they would easili wipe it off nope  i had some sticki spot on the steer wheel go in but they didnt clean it  i has some tini water spot and dri up dirt spot on the exterior still there  dri up pine leav ok they were all gone  pretti much disappoint at the end result i alreadi know i was go to get this kind of result so i just left

i onli came here for 20 cent off a gallon of gas it was pretti much a free car wash sinc i fill it up  you first go insid pay for the car wash then you either pay insid again for the gas or pay outsid  after pump your gas you then you drive your car around the back and drop off your car and wait for them to call you out to your car the wait area insid has a comput and tv and it air conditi need to updat this review  ive been back to the glass nickel sever time sinc the last writeup and sad i find myself like the pizza less and less

why

it becom larg tasteless  the cardiac arrest with it plethora of sausag pepperoni bacon and other salti meat still hold a special place in my everharden arteri  but asid from the ca ive not found a pizza that has ani real tast to it

iv tri the breakfast pizza the couch potato the big eddi the chicken alfredo the santa fe and the thai and i honest think they all tast about the same  the crust has becom overwhelm breadi and heavi the sauc near flavorless save for the spici sauc which pack a pleas punch and the top bland  

i brought a group of friend to the glass nickel last weekend and it probabl the last time that ill be back  we order three pie  the breakfast pie the ca and the thai pie along with nickel nugget chicken strip fri and a bunch of beers

th ca was the onli one that had more than 1 piec taken from it the breakfast and thai pie were left to languish  no flavor too doughi what am i eat i cant eat that were the comment from my friend  and sad i agre with them  wors yet the chicken strip and fri were demolish  they were the onli thing that had much flavor to them  ad a final dagger was the check  well over 100 for our group of 6  yikes

servic was decent but the food was such a disappoint  glass nickel what happen to you  

roman candl remain solid as doe rosati tip order an extra thin crust from rosati  it phenomen so at least ive still got a few decent altern to satisfi my pizza craveall thing consid bianco get 2 star  onli pizzafood consid id probabl give it a 35 or 4 star  howev half of din is the experi  and when it come to bianco the experi is terribl  basic if you dont like to wait longer than 12 hrs for a tabl you should go somewher els  the owner purpos keep the place small so the wait time is alway over 1 hour  they onli take reserv for 6 or more peopl assum avail  they own the hous next door and have convert it to a barwait area  actual even the wait area requir you to wait in order to score a seat insid  otherwis you are doom to wait in the 100 degre heat on the porch  

have eaten at bianco i am realli perplex by whi there is alway such a wait  i mean the pizza is pretti decent but bang for buck it realli not that much better than the phoenix chain nypd ny pizza dept  the onli assumpt i can make is that phoenix area lack wellreview restaur so peopl alway flock to bianco becaus it has been pretti wellpublic  

as for the food bianco has pretti good pizza  after all the chef did grow up in brooklyn  the pizza is thin crust good amount of chees and sauc and they are woodoven cook  the menu has a choic of 7 or 8 pizza a few appet and a few deserts

if you want good pizza without a wait go somewher els  if you want to wait for 2 hour eat good pizza and be abl to say you ate at the pretenti bianco then go tri it

ad final i think part of the reason whi i think it is overhyp is becaus it is pizza  in my opinion someth like bianco pizza has minim ingredi and uncompl trick of the trade  of cours there is probabl a lot of skill that goe into make the dough exact the right way and i can respect that  he doe a good job at that  the sauc probabl has some ingredi and season that add to the qualiti  but at the end of the day it is pizzaand american pizza at that  he make all the pizza himself becaus he want to not becaus he has to  if he want to i cant imagin it would be terribl difficult to hire assist to help him put the sauc top and chees on  pizzeria bianco present itself as an authent italianstyl pizza hous take pride in it qualiti of ingredi and consist of dish  whether the establish has succeed for it averag patron is subject to debat  as a general caveat do not trust in ani phoenixbas review of this restaur  phoenix is not even remot a world class dine citi and ani restaur in the citi cannot be object judg by ani resid of the phoenix metropolitan area  the nation pundit have tout this as the best pizza in america by icon like the food network and even oprah winfrey  wherea the food was of accept qualiti the dine experi itself leav a great deal of room for improv  

upon enter the restaur an air of pretens wash over the diner the restaur and it staff is adequ awar of the recent press surround pizzeria bianco and it is appar in the treatment of it patron  i got the distinct impress that the staff was do me a favor by seat me instead of me do them a favor by provid busi   

asid from the ostentati behavior there is typic a 2 hour wait  this is an egregi wait even though i was mental prepar for such a wait  beyond that park is difficult to come by consid it smallerthanfastfood style park lot and phoenix is not an urban environ drive is almost mandatori  the wait time have accumul due to the nation press and on a pure subject judgment call the ever increas desir of everyon in phoenix to be a part of someth trendi  sinc the wait was so long the anticip of the food delect grew in our alreadi whet appetit  to hold us over we treat ourselv to a few of the appet at the annex bar next door  prosciutto was mediocr the lack of creativ begin to seep in our impress as the dish is improp pair with poor cook crostini  next we had a select of gourmet chees so entir pedestrian that one might wonder if a kraft repres was secret replac foreign chees sampl with basic flavor  the chees did not present itself in a natur progress order along the palett leav conflict flavor fight over oral real estat  

after repetiti glanc at my wristwatch to gaug just how much time has pass my parti was final call to our tabl a total wait time of 25 hour  despit the lack of apolog for the wait my friend and i were excit to have a seat  we start with a local organ green salad  the green were not as fresh as one would have hope a linger bitter tast hover and is not well compens by an uneven distribut vinaigrett dress  we move on to an insalata capres though the menu left the english translat authent italian inde  this dish was delici  the oliv oil was of high qualiti as was the tomato basil and mozzarella chees  all ingredi were fresh and veri tasti  this basic dish was the singl best piec of food serv to us  

sinc there were sever of us dine that even we order pizza across the menu and share famili style  the crust on each pizza was delici the qualiti of the crust can not be underst  it handl well in strength and durabl against pizza with tomato sauc and was stiff and at the same time chewi enough against pizza that are larg chees or meat base  howev wherea my pizza crust was excel the other at the tabl complain that their was burnt thus the consist the owner strive for by hand make everi pizza is entir suspect  the other ingredi for the pizza left room for desir  the sausag was fatti sauc too zesti select of chees seem out of balanc with the accompani flavor veget were elementari and sometim undercook  

in summari this was a larg disappoint dine experi  the nation critic must have been treat to a much better dine experi becaus mine was onli memor becaus of how ridicul over hype this restaur is  this is a consist emerg theme in phoenix the fastest grow citi in the unit state  


ps  i was not abl to adequ comment on the wine select but i would assum it is poormeh yeah that was a pretti good pizza amaz thin crust with the perfect amount of sauc and chees howev the outer rim of my pizza was pretti bad burnt and tast aw and the salami on the sonni boy is incred salti yes i know it salamibut geez id advis you to custom your own pizza when you final get a seat and not go with the suggest combo but enough about the food

an hour and twenti minut to get a seat by myself at the bar on a tuesday night no way that was worth it i suppos it consider of them to have a wine bar next door that patron can wait in but it just made me pay more money for appet and beer to pass the long wait ill admit the focaccia appet i got was scrumptiousbut no deal breaker by ani means

so bottom line if you have absolut noth to do with your even come here with a group of friend you might get some comfort seat in the wine hous as you wait for who know how long and enjoy your pie over cheer convers when the blue moon final pass and you score some seat but im sure you have better thing to dook yaropb yet anoth review of pizzeria bianco

thi place is just oknoth to brag about and defin not worth the 24 hour wait

10pmgot bore of the pizza decid to tri otherssad same effect

al in all this place is okay is it worth 3 hoursno  is it better than littl ceasar yes

whi the long wait then  caus the place is tini mayb 25 seat and an hour and a half to two hour dine timeplus media hype

whi the good review  caus after 4 hour of hunger and or booz even taco bell mexican pizza would be the best thing you ever tast that night

needless to say jack bauer doe more in 4 hoursand this is 45 hour i will never get backthe pizza was excellentnot the best in the countri howev that honor should go to via tribunali in seattl the crust was perfect the biancoverd pizza our favorit whi 2 star we arriv at 545 pm on a blister 113 degre saturday night and were told we would be seat in 23 hour ok not great but ok the scam is that you have to wait at their bar next door or be forc to check in everi hour by their time calcul we should have been seat around 815 pm guess when we sat down to dinner folk 930 pm we spent that time spend  in their notsowellcool bar with not veri mani seat nice way to get 2 tab out of one even restaur owner onc we were seat in the actual restaur we also sat at a bar we love bar seatinghowev this bar has one side with leg room the other side has no leg room our awesom luck continu i was wear a skirt and guess which side we were seat at it was not a good arrang their waiter didnt feel like waiter more like expedit work the floor after suffer through the indign of an outrag long wait one of these expedit didnt approach us for anoth 10 minut now it 940ish final we get servic which was on the gruff side i still cant sit at the bar quit right so when a coupl leav the other side of the bar the side that has leg room i approach the manger to see if we can move perhap a tini victori but a victori nonetheless we spend the next 20 minut talk about the veri good pizza in an set up that huck the buck from those who waitand everyon doe even though we enjoy the pizza we wont be go back tip the bald bartend said their slowest seasonslowest night were mayseptemb wednesday and thursday if you must go onc to get it out of your system if your a glutton for punish then you have found your favorit new restaurlet me prefac a few thing just so were clear as to where im come from 1 im from chicago so deep dish is where it at though that doesnt mean i lack the abil to appreci a good slice when i have one no matter the style but pizza is pizza and good pizza is easi to recogn  2 this place is so hypedup it difficult not to expect some veri delici food so as you can tell by my rate it did not meet expect 3 i do enjoy hatin on thing but in review i tri to keep a relat civil and open mind and give the benefit of the doubt where i can that said let begin 

i can onli think of one word to describ pizzeria bianco obvious as it may be overr im pretti sure the popular of this place lie in it exclus a sens of snobberi but it access to the averag joe with 3 hour to kill 

we arriv one even a month so back it was a bit of a goingaway parti with my fianc and i and two of our closest friend we knew the place was popular so were prepar to wait after put our name in if i recal it was around 6 or so when we did such and told of our threehourtour of a wait we decid to head next door 

i was told the bar next door was own by the same folk so we thought whi not make it a biancoeven upon entranc to the bar which is basic the wait area for patient patron we discov that this place was also full to the brim also i should note that i keep use quot around the word bar becaus they onli had a few beer on tap and a wine list neither of those thing strike a fanci with me though as a self proclaim alcohol ill drink what avail the issu though was still that the place was pack 

after some deliber and a great backup plan from my fianc we actual decid to go across the way to the british pub rose and crown i believ awesom place too but that a differ review after sever round of drink and pool we figur our threehour wait was about up it was actual a littl over even we mosey our way back over to bianco and proceed to wait anoth half hour or so 

final around 930 or so we were insid and seat fortun enough in my own seat and not the next patron lap this place is tini rememb exclus a quarter of the restaur is the kitchen with the brick oven for the pizza great we can watch our pizza come out of the oven final some promis 

speak of the food we order an appet of prosciutto wrap asparagus with mozzarella chees i hate to spoil the review earli if you can call this earli but this was the highlight of the meal and to be honest what doesnt tast good wrap in prosciutto or bacon a bottl of wine for the tabl and four order pizza later we were readi for the maincours if your still read then you know this is all down hill thin crust i knew that was come and im fine with it surpris small i think we manag to fit all four pizza on our tabl without space concern so im think these were probabl 12 or so 14 mayb 

im a carnivor so i requir that the pizza we order contain meat which 3 of the 4 did dont get me wrong i like veggi too but theyr onli part of a well round meal we order the rosa the wiseguy the sonni boy and the biancoverd 

now im go to say that if you handcook each of your pizza as i was told the owner doe i would think you could manag to not send them out black on the bottom especi after thousand of practic prior to these four mayb im not hip to how they do it in itali but im not a fan of carbonflavor pizza crust which all of our pizza were as for the topsid of the pie they were lack in the flavor depart now i dont want to sit here and slam the place outright so i will give them this these were some of the freshest ingredi ive seen in a restaur which was veri nice the caveat though is that you need to support these star ingredi fresh chees and veggi and meat with some good spice or at least aroma both of which were mia  i can appreci a minimalist approach but this was barebon ingredientlisting

bianco is definit not worth the time or the effort in all actual you could take a pizzacook class swing by the store on your way home pick up some fresh ingredi and cook the thing yourself and add your own flavor to boot in the same amount of time you would wait sit down eat and leav i would have at least thought that be relat hammer everyth would have tast good but ala that wasnt the case save yourself the hassl get bomb and cook your own pizza at least youll have a morefun 3 hourfirst some background for context 

one of the two of us who contribut to this review is of 100 italian heritag and grew up in an italian neighborhood in ny pizzeria bianco was recommend to us by anoth coupl who are long time friend who use to live in paradis valley and who ate at bianco frequent they are foodi whose judgement in food we trust and the husband is also a nativ new yorker with 100 italian heritag so when they high recommend bianco we were look forward to great pizza and sinc great pizza is among the world most perfect food we didnt even mind the long wait we knew would be a part of eat at bianco 

butwel we felt complet dupe by this experi 

the pizza just was not that good and it certain wasnt good enough to justifi the near two hour wait for a tabl even if that wait was made easier by be abl to sit outsid on a love arizona even while enjoy a good glass of wine from the wine bar next door and get to meet a nice famili of new yorker also with italian heritag who had come all the way from queen to tri pizzeria bianco 

we went in for our tabl ahead of them on our way out as they were eat their pizza and we had finish our the father gestur with a big thumb down and we said we agre 

i guess it made us feel better becaus we felt veri much like the littl boy in the stori of the emperor who has no cloth who while all other are admir the emperor fineri cri out but hes nude 

the good news is the salad that start off the meal was delight fresh and dress just right with a love vinaigrett the pizza itself was just not all thatth crust was ok but burn on the outsid edg not burn as in nice char burn as in inciner weve had lot of good wood fire pizza and this is not a requir top were minim which is a good thing to let the crust shine when the crust is great but in this case there was just too littl top and the poor harri waitstaff act as if they were do diner a favor to let us eat there 

all in all were glad we tri this one time to simpli experi first hand a place that was get so much hype but with so mani realli great dine option includ pizza in the greater phoenix area we wont be back here dure our upcom visit fool us onc shame on you fool us twiceim somewhat new to arizona so when relat from out of town said they had heard of this place on the food network and knew what they need to do to get in i figur whi not

w get off work and head over to meet them at 500 when the place open there is a small valet lot full and a public park garag 1200 which the restaur will valid onli 900 though you still have to cough up 300 our dinner companion alreadi had a tabl insid which was great becaus there was a huge crowd outsid insid the restaur is teenytini with mayb six tabl that seat four or more a few tabl that seat two and a bar area where peopl can eat the bathroom are oneatatim onli and the ladi toilet did not flush proper 

i scan the menu and quick realiz that they serv pizza and some salad  that it so if you have ani dietari restrict your pretti much fcked while we are wait for our food to arriv my dine companion inform me that they show up at 300 to secur a tabl three and they werent the first in line either what 

bread come and it is homemad and delici with a crispyoutsid spongyinsid thing go on and the insid was the best  soft and delici with huge swisscheeselik bubbl dont know how els to so eloqu put it then drink refil come no one els is be serv so they fire up these order to order not bad okay i didnt have salad but they look pretti good  buffalo mozarella and fresh basil huge slice of tomato for the capres kalamata on the babi green salad 

pizza come out final 12 each for personals pizza with thin crust the fourchees was great you can realli tast the separ flavor of the chees arugula on top a coupl of the pizza had salami or sausag on them too salti and i love salt so yeah that say a lot if even i am critic on that point one pizza crust was not burn but char black on half of it but it food so it cant be perfect everi time now can it 

a tabl of two finishedpaidleft they were the first peopl to finish from the first wave of custom and it was after 600 pm when this happen and there was still a shitload of peopl outsid mean that if you dont line up at 300 to get in at 500 the soonest you can be seat is after 600 and that like if you show up between 330 and 400 for a tabl 

here where it get tricki  we paid but were finish our drink we were not the onli one there take up a firstwav tabl who hadnt left yet and after pay 150 for pizza give me a break pleas the hostess came over and ask us to clear out becaus peopl wait outsid are get upset hey i can see how that suck for them but were custom too and so is everyon els around us who have been loung around for this long when we exit the restaur the peopl wait outsid were give us and everyon els who was leav dirti look bitch pleas  it was your decis to come here and wait in this ridicul line for one for two  the food isnt that great anyway would i ever come here again hell no would i ever wait in a line that long for anyth not even if they sprinkl diamond on the overlysalti meat oh and i woke up twice in the middl of the night feel like my face was cave in on itself and had to get up to go drink waterpizza bianco was our first meal after arriv for spring train  it pretti close to the airport about 15 minut away  we arriv at 9 pm to which the hostess gave us an approxim wait time of 90 minut  we sat on the bench and grab some wine from the bar next door  sure enough we werent seat until about 1030 pm  be sure to stay around the restaur at 10 pm as they perform a roll call  

we order a wiseguy and margurita for our entre  our waitress gave the tabl by us bread and oliv oil but neglect us until we ask anoth waitress  the bread was actual quit delici  as for the pizza it was good but not outstand as we hope  we have had similar pizza in dalla and san francisco  was this the best no it was not   wait for a few hour one expect the pizza to live up to the hype and unfortun the pizza is overr  

we left say that we tri pizza bianco but we wont be back here for our next spring train trip  it just not worth the wait and there are other pizza place just as good in the phoenix areaive been a hand of time now  all ive had is the pizza but ive had most of the menu not difficult with onli 6 choic  the last time i went my friend ad addit item which didnt improv their pizzas

th posit  good crust and fresh organ ingredients

th negat  poor pizza design poor execut long lines

on bit of good news is that pizzeria bianco is now open for lunch  the last two time ive eaten here there was no line both were afternoon meal  the line are still long in the evenings

i like the crust as over thin and slight burnt as it might be  and i appreci the organ ingredi  but they just dont tast veri good  the margherita and biancoverd two pizza style i normal love are just kind of bore  supplement ingredi expens to add and the restaur actual add too much of them to your pizza dont help  the sonni boy has sort of a sharp olivey flavor which isnt desir and the wiseguy pizza is less than the sum of it parts

but in addit to the flaw pizza design ive experienc inconsist in the pizza ive had  the same pizza can tast substanti differ on differ visit  some might argu someth about each pizza be uniqu becaus they are made by hand but my experi is that it is simpli poor execution

on last item  this didnt contribut to the review but is worth note  this has to be the worst pizza ive ever had the next day  whether eaten cold or reheat someth i do with a lot of pizza it is borderlin ined  not a requir for a good pizza place bur dont overord becaus your take home portion will just go into the trashyou would think jesus was make your pizza from all the other reviews

mi guess is you will absolut love it there  i dont like it it  the pizza are incred small for the price and there are better pizza to be found right here in phoenix that are less expens and you wont have to wait a few hour to eat

th pizza itself is fine it not horribl or anyth but it most certain doesnt live up to the hype the small space and huge demand mean the tabl are veri close to each other  if you are look to a semipriv convers over dinner this isnt the place  i suspect that to a lot of peopl there is a charm with the social interact between the tabl just know that go inover price over rate and look out over head we had heard such great thing about this restaur that perhap we set our hope too high

w went to pizzeria bianco a few month ago for lunch it was a bit after the lunch rush so we didnt have to wait but the restaur was pretti full 

the menu is a bit spars but we figur that it was so good they were concentr on qualiti vs quantiti of menu offer we order the handmad buffalo mozzarella and basil capres salad and a sonni boy pizza that had salami and gaeta oliv bianco claim that they use local tomato and im not disput that they do howev we went in the height of the tomato season when heirloom are at their peak and plenti at the farmer market yet they serv us tasteless limp tomato with a schmear of balsam i never salt my food but the mozzarella should have been brine when they made it as it had no flavor  for a 9 appet it simpli was not up to par

th pizza was also underwhelm the crust was ok but the top were minim and the chees on top was bare cook i was sit in the tabl at the far corner near the front of the restaur and i kept see speckl of dust in the air i made the mistak of look up and i saw that the wooden beam in this restaur have about an inch of dust on them that flake down on me and my pizza dure the cours of my meal i was kind of too gross out to continu eat and i was actual too embarrass for the restaur to tell the wait staff who probabl couldnt do anyth about it anyway 

hope they have done a deep clean of the restaur in the last few month honest if you have ever look at the dust that accumul on your ceil fan if you havent clean it in awhil it look like that x 10 our simpl lunch was about 30 mayb they charg us an extra top for the dusti like durant out of principl but this is by no mean a great restaur by my estim the three separ time ive been were riddl with lacklust servic improp prepar seafood and meat with the wrong temperatur medium mean medium right or has beef fallen into the rare is the new medium fashion continuum 

i remain altogeth unimpress i would howev hide here if the law was look for me it just that kind of placei dont know exact what to say about this place i hate it  i know that for sure i just cant put word togeth as to whi 

i wasnt impress with the guac  so what if some emo guy with horn rim glass stab at some avocado and other dice veggi with a spoon for 30 second is that suppos to make me piss myself with excit anyway it tast pretti bland and for 1050 i think it should tast better the chip that came with it were a littl greasi but okay 

our entre were about 15 buck each and i almost laugh when they arriv four tini pathet lukewarm soft taco alon on a cold plate it look like someth i couldv bought on a street corner in rocki point for 2 buck we had the option of get salad or fri with our taco fri how is that mexican we had the salad which were okay 

they onli had corn tortilla which i person dont like i had carn asada and my girlfriend had shrimp the beef was pretti good  and the shrimp was okay the chees they put on our taco was kinda gross neither of us were realli impress 

on top of that the place was pretti loud i guess it understand for a small crowd space mayb they couldv use some acoust panel or someth my tabl almost tip over on me  i just never felt comfort there at all i actual felt so uncomfort i forgot what stuff was  like i had to ask him to clarifi what carn asada was someth i order and eat all the time i just got all confus after look through their menu the server was fake nice to us but i felt hate we onli saw him at the begin and end of our meal we kinda got ignor on the drink refil  i think it cuz we werent order booz which they make a fortun on

a food goe this place is edibl but not good it nowher near worth these price it compar to the pink taco but slight less douchey perhap neither place is veri authent or good i ask what on the menu was spici and he said noth they also onli have one dish with rice  onli one  and it just a special becaus they normal dont have ani dish with rice what the hell is that 

i sometim wonder whi peopl like place like this it as though they just like it becaus the place is crowd and the food is expens it just bland food overr overpr this place can suck it  i wont be backas im sit here this morn cast my zagat vote i cant help but feel underwhelm by the select on their arizona top restaur i cant help but wonder whi some of these place are on here is barrio cafe realli the best of for me i think not

w went with about 6 friend so we were abl to tri mani thing on the menu howev noth even remot stood out oh yes someth did the loud dine room it was so loud we were liter shout at one anoth from across the tabl i love to talk over dinner so my throat was pretti hoars afterward ah yes the waiter was a veri nice look man and was super flirti with all of us he got a big tip

otherwis i scratch my head and wonder whi so mani peopl gush over this place it not bad it just blahi know this is blasphemi in my hood but i didnt like barrio cafe  my husband and i had been tri to make it in there for a while now but everytim we go there it pack so we opt for someth less crowd  we final pop in dure lunch it pretti cozi insid  the server was rude anyth we said he act like he had no idea what we were talk about and never crack a smile  i had the pollo poblano the sauc was lack in flavor chicken was dri  for the price i was expect someth better  i didnt even like the margarita and ive never met a drink i didnt like  mayb the chingona was outmayb im just a crazi new england but this place was noth special

first of all they serv stale bread and some sort of roast red pepper spread at your tabl  sorri but it just doesnt go

insid is super loudtheyv got speaker all over the place and it not a big restaur  live music is a nice thought but it liter deafen 

food is just not good  taco were bland  tabl side guacamol has a kitchen sink recip and use avacado that arent even ripe  also had a vegetarian dish that was just roast veggi cover with a ton of chees  

servic was not good either  waiter forgot what we order write stuff down would be ok by me and stuff came out slow  

definit wouldnt go backi had heard great thing about barrio cafe so decid to tri it out last night  my boyfriend and i arriv at the restaur at 9pm and were told the wait was 30 minut it end up be over 45 minut and while be shown to our tabl we pass at least 3 empti tabl  frustrat but what can you do

whil wait for our tabl we sat at the bar in the onli two chair that they have and order a coupl of margarita the bartend prepar them lightn fast but the tast was off and unbalanc at 12 a pop a big disappointment

for an appet the waiter suggest the lobster quesadilla  the 4 quesadilla arriv on small corn tortilla  each had chees a sweet sauc and one bite size piec of lobster  a littl awkward to eat and at 16 just not worth it

for entre we chose the famous cochinita pibil pork and the chile en nogada  two dish that had gotten great yelp review  the pork tast alright but was pretti dri  the side of jus ad a littl more flavor and moistur but not enough  this dish came with the super small taco tortilla and when we ask for a coupl extra we were told that the kitchen was close  the chile en nogada was an interest dish but it had so much go on that all of the flavor were muddl  roast poblano chicken walnut appl apricot red sauc almond sauc cilantro pomegran seed chees  

two hour and 100 later we left barrio cafe unsatisfi and disappointbarrio cafe  meh ive had better 

we were look forward to tri this place an now that we have i at least can say ive them a tri  this place fall way short on the flavorroma scale when it come to tasti mexican food   we have a group of five so we tri sever thing on their menu  the first thing we notic were the portion  muy pequena  ok so this is differ than what mani of the pic on yelp look like but mayb it not the size that matter in this place but rather the qualiti of food  pue no la calidad es el mejor promedio nope the qualiti is averag at best  mani of the pollo and rice item were veri dri  we also had an issu with our server  he was no where to be seen for sever minut so we had to sick the hound dog after him to get some refil 

anyway this place seem to fill up with plenti of local  so good luckwe decid to tri this place becaus we saw it on tv on diner drivein and dive but realiz now that should have been a reason not to tri it barrio cafe is overpr and underwhelm 

on the show we saw the chef prepar a chili  relano but when we went to order it there none on the menu instead we went for the chicken enchilada and fish taco we start with the award win horchata   we must have got some from the bottom of the barrel becaus it was super graini and gross i didnt even drink mine at 550 the taco and enchilada were both fine but noth special

with the amount of hype surround this place we expect more  especi for 20 a person or moreawkward set up that is messi and unorgan it one of those place where you are not sure what to do or where to stand or where to get your food and coffe  and they dont care they are tri so hard to be hipster and cool that they forgot about custom servic they just need to rethink they way they oper and i think they would rock sinc the coffe is veri good the food is just averag howev my biggest complaint is that there is one dark hair short girl that work there that just seem out of it and rude she doest look at you when you order and then end up make you repeat yourself sever time also  shes not veri polit mayb i just wasnt hipster enough for her 

i think most peopl go here bc of the hype and to scope out other if you dont feel like get look up and down while you drink your coffe dont go here lola or urban bean are much betteri will give teepe a coupl of star for have lardless bean and for the weird oldschool style of the place it is a serious throw back to a time that no longer exist but i order in my prevegan era the famous chile relleno and what i got made me want to gag
what they have creat is a green chile flatten and then cover in some terribl meringu how in the hell is that a chile relleno 
relleno mean stuf in spanish not top with french meringue
httpenwikipediaorgwikichilerelleno
then they put some shred iceberg on top and give you a side of some sort of mysteri red sauc that you are suppos to use as a top 
i am a nativ tucsonan who has been eat texan arizonan new mexican californian and sonoran mexican chile relleno my entir life and can honest say these are the worst ive ever had 

this is what chile relleno normal look like

trust me on this one dont go here for the food go here to smoke cigarett wear copper and purpl color cloth and drive home in a much much too big car

i think i ate a cliff bar insteadthe teepe is a mysteri of what you ask the mysteri is whi do peopl still come here

th food is averag the margarita are averag the servic is averag the onli thing i can say they excel at is the nois level

ther are a hell of a lot better place to get mexican in phoenix i will forgiv you if you chose this place over macayo or garcia it is a step up from therenice bar but otherwis gringo slop this is amateur hour peopl their food  is a coloss failur it no wonder bush like to eat here when he is in town no self respect arizonan or mexican would ever return here for a second gastronom beat the bean were crap the enchilada were crap the taco were ok at best the salsa wasnt great there should be a helplinafter month of avoid los dos molino in favor of place with better servic and margarita we decid to return last saturday night and give the place anoth chanc we were actual even less impress with the experi than last time 

mi blue corn enchilada were still quit good but my husband chimichanga was just averag i guarante you that you can get a better chimichanga for half the price at mani of the other great mexican restaur in south phoenix the accompani rice was also realli dri i think the rice at poncho is a lot better 

i also gave the tequilaflavor limeadei mean margaritasanoth chanc but was still complet disgust by them the most amus part is that after i told the server that i found them to be too limey and sweet last time he admit that they mix the margarita up in advanc and that if the server doesnt proper stir the mix they can be too sweet he then promis me that it would be better this time i guess im a sucker for order one anyway i guess i had this morbid desir to see if it was realli go to be as bad as last time but shame on los dos molino for approach margaritamak like theyr serv drink at a colleg parti 

final the servic is total pretenti for no reason i understand that this restaur is veri popular but i dont feel that the owner take much pride in put out consist goodqual food and drink or in be a place where peopl feel comfort and want to linger with friend 

los dos molino must alway be so busi becaus peopl are lure by the exot spici and mayb fals equat spici with authent but i have a feel that discern restaurantgo who notic and care about the detail might not be in love with the placeafter hear so much about dos molino i was disappoint to say the least  

first let me mention that the front door is on the side of the build   next dont let them put you into that first tabl which is incred tini especi if your 7 month pregnant and eat with 3 men  im onli 52 but my belli was liter up against the tabl  the guy were super squish too so i had us move as there were plenti of other tabl  in tri to get out of the littl booth i slice my finger on the stapl that hold the fabric back onto the wood chair back nice  they should fix that  and that should be the last tabl they sit peopl at  

let move on  servic was slow but we final order  i got the chicken chimichanga and a side of guac  well i tri to get a side of guac but they brought us an appet of guac which is more  of cours  that might have been ok sinc there were 4 of us but it was terribl  realli  yes 4 hungri peopl and we didnt make a dent in our appet of guacamol  it was somewher in between an avocado which i love and guacamol which i love but somehow was still disappointing

mi chicken chimichanga had good flavor but there wasnt much to it  the size was ok but it was basic just a deepfri tortilla that was stuf with chicken  meh im over this place  mayb you have to come for the spici food but im restrict on that right now becaus im preggo

wont see ya therewent for dinner on a sat night i made reserv 1 week in advanc and when my friend and i arriv to check in for our tabl we were hand a pager and told we could go stand in the bar area see as how there was no place to sit and have a cocktail not real sure whi i bother to make the reserv about 40 min later we were taken to our tabl where there was no one els seat at first for the teppan cookingkind of a bummer about anoth half and hour and more peopl were seat it onli about 10 pm now and my friend is liter starv the bar area is a joke mayb i just dont go to scottsdal often enough but are these peopl serious there were mayb 4 guy under 25 the rest were in their mid to late 40s the women were about the same age probabl but wore outfit like they thought we wouldnt know how old they were if we just focus on the spark sequin shirt and puffi skirt or as my friend said are these ladi reliv prom night or what anyway food of cours is so over price and where you think you might get 4 of an appet you get 2 noth real special about this place onc you look beyond the decor and focus on the scene servic and foodthank i will go to hon machioh sapporo i had high hope for you 

i came here with some friend this past weekend and ive heard good thing about it

w had reserv but we were a few minut late so they gave our tabl away so we didnt get to do the teppanyaki we miss happi hour so we order from the regular menu let just say i was disappoint and everyth was just onli mediocr for me and was extrem overpr first i want to tri their pinot noir two of the pinot noir that i pick out they were out of the 3rd one that i final receiv was onli ok and it cost me 15 i couldv gotten a bottl of wine for that price my friend order a certain zinfandel and they were out of that as well i dont understand that becaus it was a saturday night you need to be prepar and stock for your custom i order the philli roll of cours and the salmon tempura both roll were ok but noth special 

all in all i wasnt satisfi and was upset at how expens it was if anyth mayb ill come back to tri their happi hour i did like their decor and ambianc of the restaur though and if you check in then you get a free dish of edamamtheir most recent exposur on top chef master had an outoftown friend want to check this place out  after our first visit  mani year ago i figur it would be a nice treat to go back

aft make reserv for a thursday even they told us they would onli hold the reserv for 5 minut becaus they are that busi  okay

w were a parti of six  four adult and two kid  

 chicken dumpl 695    basic deep fri wonton with chicken and veget and serv with a sweet chili sauc  this order was most to satisfi the kiddies

 our friend recent had a crispi catfish piec salad 1395 at anoth thai place and want to tri their version  when he saw the present he was immedi disappoint  the piec were a bit larger than he would have hope and it was just an okay salad tastewise

 the husband was certain about one dish in particular  the crispi duck curri  he love it befor and that all he could rememb  when the waiter heard this he insist we order the crispi panang curri instead and assur us we would love it  it also cost 2095  i ask him if he was certain we realli would and he said yes  we thought it was just alrightand not realli worth the 21 cost of it especi  sure it was tasti but ive had better panang curri in vega for a fraction of the price

 we also opt for someth from the chef special  the red snapper  sure it was a whole snapper at market price which end up be 35  our friend couldnt believ it when he discov how much they charg for it

when the waiter initi took our order he ask what our spice level choic was  we want the salad and curri mild sinc the kid would be eat it  howev it was far from mild and we were unabl to serv it to the children  as we near the conclus of our meal we want to add anoth dish  we ask the waiter for some suggest and he most focus on thing from the chef special that were market price or didnt appeal to us  we ultim decid we were done with the meal  

i did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hope for a save grace but there was noth excit on there and our visit friend were done with their lotus experi at this point

overal it was a disappoint visit  sure they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leav us want more mayb we order all the wrong dish  we probabl wont be come back here anytim soonof cours we tri it for the name associ with it howev we were not impress with the food  we had a light lunch at the bar servic was good the decor is veri attract and chic  

we were actual go there for lunch and decid on go light after view the menu and the price  the menu was not the most invent for their few choic and the price were a bit rich for our blood for a casino lunch

w had alreadi order drink my hubbi a coke and myself a glass of chardonnay  he had the new england clam chowder and i had the crab dip  

we were not impress at all and still walk out pay too much money

emeril i love you babi but the bam factor was not herebf and i stop here prior to the ka show  emeril new orlean fish hous is locat insid the mgm where ka was play which made it convenient

our server was hospit  i drink a lot of water with my meal  my water glass was never empti  

we had the tuna taco which were 17 for three small serv  i didnt like the sweet flavor and the price point was too high  we also had a side of mushroom which was 9  it was equal overpr  the mozzarella salad was perfect balanc  it was light and flavoron our trip to vega a coupl month ago we stay at the hotel at mandalay bay  saturday even not feel like go out into the hot desert air for food we decid to stay at mandalay bay and look for some good reason price eat  yeah i know reason price eat at mandalay bay good luck huh  well we didnt find them  we saw burger bar in the restaur list in our room and decid to check it out  upon arriv we look at the menu outsid the place and it was a littl bit more than we want to spend on a late dinner  we left and walk around the shop area and by the restaur insid the casino area and confirm what we alreadi knew no cheap eat at mandalay  with no better idea we went back to burger bar   it was pretti busi and there was a wait for a tabl so we decid to sit at the bar where there was no wait  
 
burger bar has a pretti wide varieti of meat chees bread and top for you to build your own burger  they have a veggi burger turkey lamb angus beef ridgefield farm beef and kobe beef  onc you choos your meat and bread you can add chees and other top as you like but of cours each top cost extra  they have the usual top like bacon mushroom onion chili and pepper  if your feel adventur and have some money to burn you can get some of the more exot top like shrimp 600 lobster 1200 foie gras 1200 or black truffl 13 oz for 3000  to go along with your burger they have fat fri skinni fri sweet potato fri zucchini fri or onion ring  final if you dont feel like a burger they have a marin chicken breast a salmon steak or a few differ salads
 
after waiver between the angus beef burger and the kobe beef burger i decid what the hell im in vega ill go for the kobe beef  i decid on mozarella chees fri egg mushroom and jalapeno bacon for my top and a side of fat fri to go along with it  should have been a five star burger but it wasnt  i would have been way happier with a fatburg for 13 of the price  i havent had a lot of kobe beef and i had high expect for it but it serious let me down  it tast like angus beef noth special  i ask for it medium and it was overcook too  kind of crunchi on the outsid  the top were good but again noth better than what i could have gotten at fatburg  the fri were good but that isnt tough to do fri right  
 
overal a disappoint overpr burger  four star for the select but minus two for the tast and price  the onli reason i would come back here next time im at mandalay bay would be to get a milkshak to go  sit at the bar we were right in front of where the server made the milkshak  whole milk real ice cream and hershey chocol syrup the perfect chocol milkshak  they also have vanilla peanut butter strawberri and banana  mmmmchocol banana peanut butter milkshakedrool  i sore regret not get one  it was howev enjoy to watch the cute waitress make them  darnit now i have the milkshak song in my headho hum ho hum
i had high expect for this place
but
servic was pain slow
tri the kobe burger american class  buffalo
al dry
overpr burgers
i never mind pay good money for a good burger
but
im lean toward  definit skip this placeis it a crime to love a simpl charcoal grill smokeladen burger serv rare to med rare ive done mani trade show at the mandalay and have eaten at bb more than a few time the fact that i walk out each time think thank good this is a busi expens and not an outofpocket expens pretti much sum it up for me 

whi cant a nonam chef just set up a weber in one of the park lot and crank out a great old american chees burger hell i dont need fanci addon just great beef great chedder fresh tomato and head lettuc fresh or carmel onion and ill promis not to critiqu the menu price chanc of that happen soon not good im afraid

i dont want to choos my add fuddruck introd that year ago i figur that if a burger restaur has a great burger theyll know better than i what option work give me a few finishedsandwich choic includ a frisco burger and im good to gothe skinni quot the hub  you can get this same st for half the price at a hospit cafeteria or the frozen food aisl at walmart frank hubert keller should be asham to serv such swill 2 sticki seat slow servic at the bar 2 valu skip this joint and head to five guy or in and out  way better in term of qualiti cleanli and valu 2

we went here for happi hour on a weekday and it was as boister and loud as if it were a weekend this place is pretti hop and there were a crowd of peopl wait to be seated

luckili we onli want to tri the happi hour so we were abl to walk through and find a small space at the end of the bar to settl ourselv in anoth gentleman told us  just grab a chair that what i did so we did precis that unfortun the seat that i stole was inher sticki from some unknown substanc which kind of increas the ew factor in addit to this it took a long while to get menus or heck even get anyon to acknowledg our presence

w order their buffalo wing chicken strip plate of 3 slider and their wedg salad

their buffalo wing had a nice textur howev it was noth special to me the season of the wing was a standard hot sauc just like what you can get anywher els the dress it was serv with lack ani sort of distinct flavor  if you cant tell if it ranch or blue chees that pretti freak bad 

the chicken strip had a heavi slight salti bread that tast like what youd get at ani averag cafeteria same goe for the fries

th wedg salad was kind of disappoint becaus the tomato were on the meali side yuck

fin their slider it was rather unfortun that their meat is inadequ season which ruin it all for me

al in all the food here is edibl but hard more than that given hubert keller reput it should be way better than this factor in the costthi place is a 2 star in my bookthe reservation
cal one week earlier to make a reserv got charg 100 nonrefund fee  just in case we dont show up 
arriv at the place at  8 pm and was told tabl not readi and that theyll get us short five min pass check with hostess nothing
ten min pass check with hostess noth 15 min pass and guess what happen yeap noth  at that point my husband told the bitch ooop hostess
  you either seat us now or els were leav and we owe you noth it utter bs to charg us for a reserv when the restaur cant keep their end of the bargain we were seat 5 min later
th food
w told the waitress to hook us up with their best dish their signatur item  what they are known for so she recomend duck appet shrimp tamal lamb chop and we split a caesar style salad the duck was lukewarm sit insid a pancak gross
th shrimp tamal tast like someth you get from costco and microwav the lamb chop came with sweet and sour sauc  chutney relish  indian and was veri forget the salad was good  i gave them  2nd star for that 
the decor
wtf tomato sticker on glass partit 50 ident 2ft high multi color mexican caraf occupi one whole wall bobbi fley cook book cover the whole front desk area
th verdict
dont make the same mistak we did dont wast your time or   on this placemy aunt want to come here so bad on our last trip to vega she love watch bobbi flay and eventhough i am not realli into his cook i want to make her happi the hostess were veri nice becaus i had to chang my reserv time and number of our parti about 3 time but they didnt give me a hassl and were most gracious everi time they were the best part of this restaur 

we were sat right in front of the main kitchen which was nice to see them grillin and cookin we were given one small basket of bread muffin and cake sinc it was lunch time for a parti of 9 i didnt think it was enough but we just share the jalapeno biscuit were the best item in the basket 
the food one common ingredi throughoutspice
i order the pumpkin soup which had great flavor but was spici with pepper and cumin good but too much spice for me 
most of us order the mesa burger which was noth special it was larg but that it they serv it with a horseradish mustard which i dont like but pretti much other than that there was a piec of lettuc in it 
the fri that come with it were complet over spice up i couldnt even see the fri gross man it was like eat a jar of mix spice yuck two other got the salmon and it was just okay 

then the biggest flop by bobbi flay ever the pineappl upsid down cake was so gross i had to forc myself to swallow it im so sorri but pepper doe not belong in this dessert this guy spice everyth but not in a good way we also order the chocol cake dessert and it was not that great 

i wouldnt recommend this restaur with all the other choic in vegathis restaur has come to typifi the madison ethnic dine experi  rave review for overpr poor prepar food that onli tast better becaus of the impair judgement of too mani beer  

our tabl had a varieti of the pork and chicken schnitzel dish along with the spaetzl  the onli thing that had ani merit was the clam chowder  the schnitzel were bland with a heavi dirti oil tast  the spaetzl seem like they went across the street to wahke and grab some noodl  ive made box spaetzl that tast better than what we experienc  not sure what the fascin is with the factorymad pretzel that you can get at sam club

th bar environ with the polka band and seem to be festiv which is the onli reason this got more than one star  if your hungri plenti of madison restaur that do have a pass grade  if you want german food if this is the best it get may want to tri chicagothis is probabl not a fair review becaus i did not actual dine here but i feel like i need to share my stori anyway

mi girlfriend and i were tri to find a dinner spot befor we went to see a movi on a weekend night and poor plan had us look at sever restaur around the capitol with one hour wait time we walk in to harvest and were told we could be seat immedi which was wonder news

befor we were taken to a tabl anoth potenti custom behind us ask for a menu which prompt us to ask for one too to get an idea of what we were look at a quick glanc reveal that the menu was a littl pricier than we had hope to spend if you are go to eat at restaur with a pricelevel like harvest you dont want to power through the meal to make it to a showtime

w told the hostess that we were sorri but we were go to keep look which prompt her to respond this is whi we post the menu outsid so you know what is on it and you can decid whether or not to come in wow you post the menu outsid to ward off poor peopl 

this was veri disappoint and i am go to serious think twice about eat here in the futuri read recent that restaur dont tri too hard on valentin day becaus they expect that their patron are out for one nice meal and wont be repeat or regular custom i had my doubt about that assumpt until we went to harvest last night i can definit say they live up to the stereotyp and that my husband and i will as well by not be repeat or regular custom that be said harvest did some thing well but bungl too mani thing for us to take anoth chanc on this pricey restaur 

we had an 830 reserv show up on time and wait about 20 minut to be seat along with a half a dozen other coupl i get that your busi on valentin day and that peopl take their time with their meal but harvest is not new to the game and should know better than to overbook their reserv also there was nowher to stand and wait except in the doorway or in the middl of a nice littl seat area as the hostess said which turn out to be in front of anoth doorway also the hostess was rude and condescend to me when i tri to check in and point out that we had been stand there for a few minut without be acknowledg id been stand on my feet serv the public all day too ladi  no need to have an attitud 

when we final got seat our waitress was veri nice and attent for how busi the restaur was i love my elderflow sidecar and my husband enjoy his hous martini my first cours scallop were amaz and came serv in a veri good sauc i thought my husband tuna confit was strang and didnt take anoth bite of it but he enjoy it 

main cours  i order the hanger steak which came with a side of potato with leek the hanger steak was okay but overal the entir dish was pretti mushi it definit not someth im saliv over think about it the next day it wasnt super flavor or memor there wasnt much season and realli noth that i can say make me want to tri it again to sum it up in one word meh which is a shame becaus i had an excel hangar steak at eno vino not too long ago which is what inspir me to tri it at harvest 

mi husband had the ny strip steak which i thought was veri chewi again not a memor dish but he seem to enjoy it 

we order one dessert to split between the two of us and tri the chevr cheesecak the cake itself was good but the fruiti stuff they put on top was so bad i couldnt take anoth bite it was so horribl tart 

husband and i both agre the scallop were the highlight of the meal which is sad becaus ive had amaz scallop elsewher so i cant see return for just that 

the piec de resist was when we were wait to pay the bill we were seat near the door so we got an eye when a jimmi john deliveri guy came in with a huge sandwich order for the staff he was quick usher back into the kitchen to unload his deliveri but not befor it was made pretti obvious what was go on harvest dont you have a back door somewher for what i thought was suppos to be an upscal place for which the price accur reflect but not much els did  that was pretti much the tackiest thing ive ever seen serious 

i was pretti disappoint about the whole experi not just becaus it was valentin day but becaus my husband and i live in the neighborhood and have walk by harvest hundr of time promis ourselv we need to tri it i can tell you the anticip was much better than the meal itself and unfortun we will not be returnthis is the place to be if your are one of the two follow type of people

1 you are in colleg becaus your abil to run with chase kick or throw ball shape objects
2 you are look to sleep with someon who is in colleg becaus of their abil to run with chase kick or throw ball shape objects

i was never a fan of this bar becaus i was not a colleg athlet and thus the women at this bar were not have anyth to do with me

wher is the bar for girl that are rocket scientist chaser  

haiku

look it number 8 
wear sweat pant to the bar 
jock get the chick here

tal level  impress most night i had an in with some volleybal girl and spent some time here as a jersey chaser myself and i must say this bar has some hotti if you are a littl guy you best say you are the kickerim go to go ahead and say this place suck 

this place claim to be a seattl style coffe shop after live in seattl for a few year and hit everi coffe spot in the citi at least onc i think i can fair comment on that first off the coffe is pretti good it definit seattl style coffe though realist not up to seattl standard at all that alright this is a coffe shop in phoenix where there are few if ani shop that actual hold up to the qualiti of seattl coffe 

what realli rub me the wrong way and definit doesnt fit in with the seattl element is the servic and staff at this place i dont want to say this is the case with everyon that work here as ben and djentrif sorri i dont know your real name have alway been awesom whenev ive gone in but the major of peopl that work here are realli stuck up mayb this should be state anoth time and anoth place but

dear phoenix hipster

you realli arent that cool you just got into ride fix gear bike six month ago when anyon that live in a real citi know it been the onli way to go for year you just got into anarchist folk punk and psychadel freak folk when all the cool kid have move on to snort coke and danc nake in club to yell you are behind you realli are not hip if you live in a real citi which hope phoenix will becom you would not be consid hip you would be consid what you are a stuck up prick

sorri for the rant but that lead me to the reason this is not a seattl style coffe shop in seattl there will be actual hip peopl work at the shop these peopl will actual respect cultur art fashion design music and all the other cool kid shit howev these peopl do not act abov you i get servic when i get coffe in seattl in this place i get treat like im not worthi of stand in the shitti old hous that lookssmel like the staff clean it onc everi six months

i brought my mom here onc after spend a day with her at the art galleri we want to get a quick cup of coffe befor i head back to my apart and she head back to mesa while order the guy work the corner had a stupid smirk on his face the whole time and was rude to my mom and was way too pushi with tri to get her to decid what she want he was make some comment to the girl that was work with him and they would look over at her and i and laugh look guy im realli sorri im not still stuck in teenageangst mode and work for the local shitti coffe shop at 25 i valu my mom time and will not put up with you treat her like shit 

if this was an isol incid i wouldnt even take the time to post this review but this is the consist attitud of the peopl that work at this place i dont know if the manag or owner are awar of this or even wors are the same way but they should probabl take a look at who theyr hire and the imag it promot about their busi im not shock at all that this place move to a far shittier locat a place that provid this level of servic doesnt belong in such a beauti neighborhood hope the histor hous can be use for someth other than hous a punch of prick jerk eachoth off over their latest 7 score 

two star for the coffe be pretti good whenev ive gone the coffe is far better at lux and drip anywayi use to frequent az 88 when i use to live in the scottsdal i love it for it settingsomewhat hidden somewhat quiet trendi enough but not too much that it suffoc i enjoy their food becaus of it simpl decadencesandwich with nofril sauc grill veget with a tangi sauc that doesnt over power and their waffl fri that make you curs atkin until his dead oh wait he is dead best of all i enjoy their drink alway refresh alway excit and alway seem to creep up to you when least expect give you a pleasant buzz that make  everyon around you appear like theyr on high definition

so realli the 2 measli star are not for the food ambianc or drink theyr for slade

it been a coupl of year or more sinc we visit az 88 i thought of go there for dinner last weekend to celebr father day afteral it use to be one of my husband favorit eat joint so  i invit my parent my kid and of cours my husband to have a quiet enjoy dinner over there

w immedi found a tabl for 6a good sign everyth was go great until slade came along slade was our slick ireallyoughttobeinlaact waiter the minut he saw our group he immedi put on his scowl face and his whydoiendupwiththesepeopl attitud was it the kid or was it the rare asian peopl who made up our group

and just a note my kid grew up eat in restaurantsfrom seasaw to in and out and yes theyv eaten at az 88 befor theyv done it all becaus i dont cook they even order mom drinksfor her of cours and yes my parent speak englishlik the kind you can understand

two second after settl to our tabl he ask what we would like to drink i have never felt pressur in my life to think of an alcohol concoct five second had pass and slade was alreadi send off telepath messag to me say hurri up bitch your wast my time so i final blurt out could you pleas give us a coupl of minut to think wed like to see a drink menu if we could he grab a drink menu plop it on the tabl and quick pivot and sashay away from our tabl without say a word

i dont know about you but i thought that was rude 

when we final decid on our drink order slade ocd obsessivecompuls disord becam appar he couldnt care less if we had enough ketchup or if we need more tangi sauc for the veget or if we need ani kind of condiment to compliment our respect meals

al he care about was make sure that each of our drink was set on a napkin 

he watch each of us like a hawk make sure that as we set our glass down it was place on a napkin one time my son unknow set his water glass on half the napkin and slade was right there to set thing right for him accompani with an annoy sigh of cours never onc did he ask if we need anyth elseh just want to make sure that our glass were on napkins

thank god for the food and the drink those did not fail us my husband enjoy that part but slade and his ocd oh and his overgel hairthat gotta go 

thus 2 starthe wife and i have eaten at lot of sushi restaur includ morimoto in nyc and we had high expect for this place the servic was good to great but you would expect that from a restaur of this price but what the deal with all the caucasian waiter who cant even pronounc omakas for the record it ohmakasay not omacase

th atmospher was pretti lack it was dark loud and look almost like someon sort of gave up on the decor it was just soso nice and didnt realli give off ani particular vibe and ive never been to ani kind of restaur other than a holeinthewal where they give you the bill on a freak round white plate then after you give them a credit card they bring back the receipt and a pen yes just the receipt and a pen no plate no folio noth they just put the receipt on the tabel with the pen doe that scream 4star restaur to you

when tri out new sushi restaur we alway like to order some of the basic to get a foundat to compar against other place we order the sushi and sashimi plate both had decent to veri good fish but not great except for two big disappoint the tuna was realli mediocr and hello take it easi on the wasabi chef sushi chef that use too much wasabi are either tri to cover up notsofresh fish or theyr just not realli good at make sushi the fish seem pretti fresh so i dont think they were tri to cover anyth up which leaves

mayb we shouldv had lower expect when we came in or mayb nobu is onli good with the fancier dish but for the price they charg for regular sushi and sashimi it just not worth it

th servic get a 4 the decorvib get a 25 and 
if the price were mayb 3040 lower i could easili have given them 3 or mayb even 4 star but for what you get id give them a 25 but sinc yelp doesnt let you give half star id round off this overpr place to a 2ive dine at nobu five time and never gotten servic abov below averag  one time the servic was horrif and when we complain the server gooseeg his own tip on the credit card slip parti of 10 1700 tab and we were gonna just give him 15 but decid to roll with his suggest  

as for the food it 4050 the qualiti of their nyc counterpart  and that generous  dont get me wrong i have all the respect in the world for chef matsuhisa but i guess that what happen when you open a restaur 3000 mile away with a dine area the size of a footbal field  some dish oversauc other overcook  no love man no love

if you want nobu style food for half the price take a trip off strip to sen of japan  if your look for highend sushi on the strip okada at the wynn the best ive had but ive yet to dine at yellowtail bellagio and friend tell me that the best  ive also had a coupl good meal at shibuya mgmcan we say pretenti 

first impress reserv was confirm via opent but somehow the hostess said that our reserv was not there she look around the restaur was about 10 fill and hesit then said someth along the line of i suppos we can seat you anyway

wait talk out of his ass serious this guy had no idea what he was say he tri to sound extrem educ in food onc i told him i was a huge fan of nobu and that i had all his cookbook and love them all when describ the lobster risotto he said and the way the chef prepar the risotto with the wakam and the seawe hi wakam is seawe the mirugai and the giant clam we call geoduck hi can you be ani more redund dont tri to play fanci foreign word game with me like i have no clue what your say i flash my best smile everytim he came to word vomit he had good intent but it was borderlin offens that he tri to add in japanes word as if we didnt know what they meant

pro the staff is veri attent veri quick to remov finish plate so that the next cours can be serv we never had to ask for a refil of water becaus of how attent the wait staff was the food was good albiet pretenti i would never ever pay 30 for five paperthin slice of hamachi with littl sliver of jalapeno and over acid ponzu again the menu was innov modern and divid into clear categori to help you order a littl bit of everi categori the wait staff is veri help with describ dish recommend dish and answer question you have about the menu

con again extrem frou frou japnes food the price is not reflect of the qualiti of food 40 for a tini amount of risotto serv in a fanci big plate that look like a bowl pleas the black cod was not fresh it seem like the miso was attemt to cover up the slight old tast of the black cod the cevich hurt my masset i probabl made the ugliest littl puckerfac from the acid in the cevich 35 tini bowl of cevich im fine with pay good money for good food but honest nobu was a let down if it tini portion at least make them spectacular tini portion spectacular it was not

w left hungri and went for a real dinner afterward sorri nobu mayb well tri anoth one of your restaur but definit not las vegathe bar for nobu was set pretti high after tri the full omakas experi at kabuto the night befor  i did my yelp homework and scour previous review make note of the oft recommend item and went in know exact what my friend and i would order

w order a gamut of differ dish shishito pepper edamam wagyu beef jalapeño yellowtail rock shrimp tempura lamp chop otoro and salmon sashimi miso black cod 

i thought i was assembl a nobu allstar meal what we end up with was a mediocr and extrem overpr meal  for everi dish that we  order i could list a superior counterpart at japonai or sunda in chicago for a fraction of the cost

also of note is the fact that our waiter initi remark that sashimi order came as two piec but when we got our bill we note that our four bites slice of otoro came to a total of 76  the wagyu was also incred overpr for what we got appar each ounc is 30 or so and the minimum order is 2 ounc  

mayb it was the sheer excel of the previous night meal but we left feel we had blown 350 on a veri unsatisfactori experi  even at half the price the valu would be question8 peopl  180000  and i left hungry

food was tasti thoughthe boardwalk hotel and casino is no more and is now where the mandarin tower is locat but it nice to rememb that it still exist in my long term memori as far as when i was a kid go to las vega back in the 90s 

what i like was look at the fake fair on the front of the hotel with the fake roller coaster in the front and i thought it was real and wonder whi i never saw it be use and the ferri wheel was fake too 

all in all it was a nice look sub par hotel on the las vega strip that live up to it glori with the land put to better use with the construct of citi center with the mandarin tower locat right where the boardwalk hotel use to bei have come to the conclus that not one singl restaur in pari hotel casino resort is edibl  not the cafe nor the buffet and now add mon ami gabi to the list  

ive been stay at this hotelcasino for 5 day thank for the comp red room pari  our last night here so i thought id give this place a tri  i was huge disappoint at my meal  we were seat in the atrium room with direct view of bellagio fountain  yes it was nice but i came here for the food  there is a door open out to the outdoor seat area and the constant chill wind which cool the food veri fast was not cool  

the jumbo lump crab cake celeri root remoulad gribich sauc was realli averag  im glad it was grill and not deep fri 

the butter lettuc  honey appl crisp salad roast beet age goat chees appl cider vinaigrett  was also forgett  i could bare tast the dress  

the roast chicken  frite  allnatur roast half chicken mushroom bacon pearl onion  oh pleeeaaassse  costco rotisseri chicken had more flavor than this  it was dri and tasteless

th filet mignon merlot butter red wine reduct which is their signatur dish and you would think it should stand out  first of all i order it medium and it came as medium rare  the sauc was suppos to be merlot butter but it was so bland that i had to add quit a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it  but after about 3 bite i had to trade it with my fianc for his roast chicken which was even wors  

and those frite what the hell were those  string potato chip  you could have serv it with french fri and that would have been better  

servic was friend but i wouldnt say it was attent  the waiter was more interest in talk to his fellow server than to his guest  

it food like this that remind me of whi i dont care for french restaurprobabl the worst meal in my recent trip to vega actual perhap one of my worst meal in vega  ever

cam here for sunday brunch and wait about 15 minut befor get seat  we had a larg parti of 10 and came at 11 am so we had the option of order from the brunch or lunch menus

it seem like everyth that could go wrong did go wrong
  our waiter just didnt seem like he knew what he was do  he told us the wrong brunch special so my friend who order the portabello mushroom egg benedict was sore disappoint when his food came out and it was some sort of pork egg benedict  the waiter shouldv told him in advanc that they didnt have his origin order not when the food alreadi came out  instead he just said whi dont you give it a tri and see if you like it  
  our food took forev to come
  my other friend order the corn beef hash but it wasnt until we had wait for who know how long befor the waiter came back and said they were all out of corn beef hash  how do you run out of someth sooo common

i was total turn off by our waiter  and most of the food is not realli worth write about

  egg benedict meh
  tritip sandwich meh
  salmon salad yuck

th two highlight were the blueberri french toast and chicken liver pate  definit recommend thosemy hubbi and i decid to celebr our wed anniversari at andr after read a great amount of rave review about this restaur what also had us interest was the fact that this restaur receiv the aaa 4 diamond award had been recogn by the michelin guid with one star rate and is nomin as las vega most romant restaur perfect way to celebr your wed anniversari we thought it would be guess we thought wrong mayb the problem was that we use a travel zoo offer we honest didnt think use a travel zoo offer would have caus such a bad experi as these offer are solicit to travel zoo by the vendor on there and not the other way around so in that retrospect we didnt think that by show up and use a travel zoo voucher we would be treat as if we had the plagu  our suggest to andr is that if you dont want your custom use a travel zoo voucher pleas stop ask travel zoo to post themproblem solv  

we by no mean have ani complaint about the tast of the food rather we are disappoint in the way they were present to us  when you are first seat they will give you the special travel zoo menu for you to choos off of initi that didnt seem like a problem until later when our food start to arriv more on that later so my hubbi order the french onion soup with swiss emment and gruyer au gratin to start and i had the lobster and corn bisqu with sweet corn cake  the tast of both were good not awesom mind blow but good the lobster bisqu could have incorpor more bit of lobster in it as it lack in flavor but other than that both soup were season well and arriv hot  this is where we start to notic that we were differ  when look over at the tabl across from us my hubbi notic that unlik myself their lobster bisqu was pour into their soup bowl tabl side by our waiter  they all order from the tast menu as well so it was kind of awkward that we had not receiv the same servic we shrug it off and await our next cours to arriv asid from our set travel zoo menu we decid to order the pansear duck foie gras the foie gras was smooth delic and full of flavor the poach pear that accompani it compliment well and the mixtur of sweet and savori danc harmoni in our mouth each bite was heaven and to die for the foie gras was the highlight of our meal encourag by this  we look forward to our next cours but to our disappoint yet anoth issu aris and replac all of the divin flavor we just had in our mouth with a bitter tast for some reason we were not offer the palat cleanser pineappl sorbet befor our next cours unlik the tabl across from us at this point we realli start to get irrit with the discrimin servic we were receiv from our waiter so on to the second cours  my hubbi order the hoisinglaz duck breast with butternut squash semolina almond currant and duck leg cannelloni and i ate the scottish salmon with saffron and shellfish emuls and lobster ravioli  both entre were delici and we thorough enjoy them  for dessert we order the chocol souffl and 
banana ice cream profiterol with warm chocol sauc we enjoy them both but like the chocol souffl over the profiterol as the banana ice cream tast more of vanilla than banana the chocol souffl arriv in perfect form and was veri delici 

the servic at andr if use a travel zoo voucher it seem is one to be less desir of  they do a good job of remind you that you are a lesser pay custom from the other from the time you check in with the hostess she ask you to present to her your travel zoo voucher then when seat your waiter just rub that in as well we notic that the other tabl that were be servic by our waiter was get except servic while he left us out in the dark and onli came by when he need to our server assist on the other hand did a tremend job and we were impress and thank for their servic they treat us well and made us feel the way a custom should feel  our waiter brought a complimentari medley of truffl for our anniversari and basic just drop it off no anniversari well wish or anyth  howev our server assist notic the truffl and congratul us along with make some small chat as well we thought he deserv to be a waiter over our as a side note we did not complain or do anyth to deserv the servic we did that night we just smile and act cordial despit the short come of the servic at no given time were we rude thus we expect to be treat the same way in return  will we ever return probabl not we were plan to without a travel zoo offer if this didnt happenim amaz to think that i was not just onc but twice yes this place is 200 when ces is around and somehow we paid for it now think back vega is most about the peopl you go with and i didnt entir have a terribl time when i was here but there was one thing i could never let go of

their elev have hole yes there are crack in the plate that hold the elev togeth the wall you can see through them to the tunnel the elev are so old i serious thought my life was in danger imagin alway wonder if you were go to fall to your death everi time you  tri to go up to your room or down to the strip  not exact fun times

thi is a cheap hotel the room are old smelli the bed are realli hard and you feel icki like a motel but perhap i can see even some motel 6s might beat out this place

they have a nice cheap champagn buffet on the weekend which is good for champagn and that about it but realli do you want to subject yourself to the terror of stare at the tunnel 

on the plus side it close to the convent center kind ofmy friend attempt to describ peppermil to me befor we ate there yesterday it as if denni and rainforest cafe had a bastard child oh well youll see two word delici tacki 

at first our waitress was prompt in take our order befor the rest of our group arriv it later took her forev to get everyon order in i split the marco polo omelet with my friend 

they describ it as a huge portion but honest i couldv finish the whole thing by myself wasnt realli impress i felt like it was lack in flavor if you didnt have a bit of the tomato hollandais sauc to eat your bite with the hash brown were good though id much rather have gotten an omelet from the omelet housi would glad give craftsteak a 5star review but for a few key reasons
1 we got better food for less than half the price at delmonico
2 the servic was slow
3 the portion were ridicul small
4 they charg 350 per soft drink refil  cheap steakhous like sizzler dont even do that and they didnt do that at delmonico

in case your interest delmonico is own by chef emeril lagasse
and tast better with a much friendlier staff and better food we regret our decis to go to craftsteak and will never return
th food was good but did not live up to it 65300 price tag for 5 people
at delmonico it was 20800 for much better food and a much more help waiter and oh by the way i got charg for everytim my glass of water was refil for the same bottl of water
whi cant i just get charg onc per bottli have been here on 2 separ occas the first was to have a dine experi and to be honest i was not impress at all we had a reserv and end up wait an addit 30 minut for our tabl that drive me crazi and is usual a bad sign

it took a while to get our wine and place our order i realli dont feel that it was that busi here is a list of the item ordered

app calamari chorizo polenta arugula handcut wagyu tartar crostini

salad italian buffalo mozzarella hazelnut warm frisé farm egg smoke bacon

entre 8 oz new york strip japan 24 hour shortrib cipollini onion

sid brais kale bacon white bean bordelais potato gratin roast garlic cream

dessert peanut butter mouss and clemenc pie

it took a wile to get our food and the food was just okay noth stood out at me as amaz i was expect a lot more from this place 

mi second visit was just for drink i was happi to just get to the bar i order the key lime martini and cucumb gin martini both were realli good and i would definit return back for drink food probabl notsteak restaur in las vega like internet cat site  exist in a hyper competit cut throat market some place that would be thebombcom in other market just cant cut the mustard when compar to vega gold standard like carn vino or outback imho craftsteak is just such a restaur it is pretti good but given it similar in cost to just about everi steak place on the strip it isnt one i would recommend 

i alway get the same thing first time around bone in ribey potato side mac and chees except for they dont have mac and chees terrorist win  

the steak the bone in ribey was mediocr at best order medium rare the meat was bare pink which was a huge misstep it didnt have a veri good crust and was sort of bland given how often tc yell at peopl on top chef for incorrect season and given it was a steak and should have enough salt on it to choke a deer this was pretti disappoint now again if this was your first vega steak experi you could overlook this and still have a pretti good meal but if you have been to other great steak restaur in the area these mistak becom more crush 

now i will say their specialti is clear the more expens steak us and australian wagyu kobe or japanes wagyu doe anyon know what these thing mean nope ok i figur so i will admit the fault could lie with me not go for a big boy steak 

potato gratinthi was actual pretti top notch it has a garlic cream sauc that is strong so if you are on a date or with a fanci prostitut you may want to stay away

whit corn grit im from the dirti south so natur i had to order this it not exact what you would expect if you have been rais on three michelin star restaur like waffl hous but it is chock full of so much bacon and gruyer chees that you cant realli go wrong 

dessert
th monkey bread is pretti amaz overal the side and dessert were the star of this meal with the steak more of a creepi extra lurk in the corner if i went back here i would probabl skip the steak altogeth and get more appssidesdessertdear pink taco

i so want to love you ever sinc my mom came to a cater event her sever year ago when i was pick out restaurantcom certif i just knew i had to have you in my life i love upscal mexican food and was hope you could deliv sad you did not 

your hostess sat us veri quick and i applaud the quick chip and salsa deliveri i didnt realiz how hungri i was until your delici salsa were in my face and your warm chip were break all over the tabl in my impati littl did i know this was to be the best of the meal 

your server took approxim a year to even take our drink order then throughout the meal he proceed to commit two cardin sin in a restaur ask if we were do okay with his hand full and his back 34 turn away from us as though we were an afterthought and the second put the check down befor ask if we want anyth els pink taco this server did not earn his includ 18 

on to your strang food choic i order your fame pink taco which had littl flavor until i ad the aforement salsa the tortilla were good the pickl onion too but the chicken and black bean past were dull i so want to like your taquito our chosen appet but the flavor was strang and by onli receiv 3 tini taquito for 750 i sigh for those who would pay full price for them  

the bottom line dear sweet pink taco is that you have all the potenti for a great awesom upscal mexican food reinventiongreat decor interest menu item and a provoc albeit silli name  somehow you miss the mark and i hope we can be togeth again under better circumst 

love

molli tthoma keller your such a disappoint 

i had such high hope for the man who creat french laundri that i expect great in the form of a croqu madam and sour cream waffl i envis the ordinari to becom extraordinari i dream of wave of flavor danc on my tongueinstead the highlight of my meal were the fri that came with the croqu madam 

wait i dont think you understand what i just said  fri were the highlight of my meal

bouchon was complet underwhelm the waffl were soggi as was the toast in the croqu madam there was noth that made me go wow everyth tast like it would at ani other place

not onli was the food mediocr but for a restaur of this statur id expect good servic instead we had the busboy take our order and attempt to answer our question where was our waiter i have no ideaw onli saw him onc or twice the entir meal

so thoma whi did you put your name to someth so blah i hope you dont disappoint me when i final make the trek to your pride and joy up northdont hate on me yelper but i realli wasnt satisfi with my visit to bouchon when i went a coupl of week ago first of all the wait was onli suppos to take 20 minut accord to the hostess but we wait outsid for a good hour this isnt some asian restaur where the hosthostess alway say the wait will onli take 20 minut so that peopl will be fool and stay longer becaus they alreadi stay for a long time the good thing is that they provid us with some realli good pastri while we were wait but then more bad thing happen

they take 30 minut to get our order  and it take about anoth 40 minut to get our food my friend didnt even get the diet coke he order at the begin until after we alreadi start eat was this special handmad diet coke no it was from a freakin bottl i know becaus he got the bottl with his glass 

i order the croqu madam expect good consid we wait so long to eat there and it was rank so high on yelp i gotta say i wasnt too fond of it the tast was just meh and the price i paid for that was disgust 19 befor tax and tip i also got to tri the mussel which were alright but the tast was a bit overwhelm i think i would have been sick of them after 5 mussel i got to tri the waffl from the chicken and waffl dish as well  the waffl were disgust there are bacon bit insid the mushi waffl gross

would i come back with all the qualiti food avail at vega with a much shorter wait probabl noti hate to give this place two star  it thoma keller and i thought i would be blown away  i have the thoma keller french laundri cookbook and have been die to tri his food  i do understand that hes not actual back there work the kitchen but with his name attach to it i am go to have high expect  unfortun our tab was extrem high our servic suck and not all of the food was on point  for the price paid the food should be mind blow except and it just was not  had the servic and food been impecc the price would not b an issue

first off we wait forev to be seat  i mean like 45 minut when they told us it would be a half an hour  we were starv  when i went to the hostess tabl to ask about the wait i was ignor by multipl peopl work the hostess station 

our waitress was super passiv aggress  she ignor me when i tri to flag her down after we had made our initi order becaus we decid to add an order of escargot as an appet  i had to ask a buse staff to add it to the order becaus even though she saw me motion to her she ignor me and never came back until much later to say she ad it to our order  i also ask for raw sugar and she forgot and i had to ask her again after wait a good while  

there were definit some high point though such as the complimentari bread with butter and apricot jamamaz  the escargot was delici but ive never had bad escargot or escargot that tast incred differ from ani place ive order it  this escargot was prepar in a veri classic manner with lot of garlic and butter and top with puff pastri  it was excel and we were happi to sop up the leftov garlic and butter with the bread on the table

on thing that i was annoy with was the water situat  i think it absolut insan to charg 7 for water from a spigot in the back that put into a bottl and refriger befor serv  it was not a seal bottl of water which i could understand if the price was higher or had it been sparkl water  the other thing is she continu to bring our tabl more water without ask and of cours we got charg for all three bottl of water brought to the tabl  i just find it insan that the water cost more than my coffe and let me tell you it tast just like the nasti water from our hotel room onli chill  do not order the flat water it is not worth the insan price tag

w went dure brunch time so i want to tri the french toast  it an appl french toast that is more like a french toastbread pud hybrid  it was gorgeous and the thin and perfect slice appl on top were tart sweet and delici  the french toast itself was underseason and bland  i had to actual add salt to it which i know sound crazi but it need it

mi one friend order a mushroom omelet which was veri small and also underseason  i also thought it would be a french style omelet but it wasnt  it came out as a thick but small fold in half american style omelet   it also came with a huge mound of perfect crispi bacon that had to have been deep fri but tast heaven  

next friend had the special of the day a blt benedict  the benedict consist of a housemad split english muffin  it was tini  the hollandais on top was veri thin and lack a full flavor hollandais should have  the bacon was fine but the lettuc was iceberg  i was underwhelm by the pale white iceberg and thought someth like butter lettuc would have elev this dish much more  the tomato was halv cherri tomato  i think a nice slice of an heirloom tomato would also have been a better choic  this dish also came with a small side of home fri that were perfect and delici  even with the housemad muffin i do not feel this dish warrant the 26 price tag

last friend order the banana waffl  t come with nut but she ask for no nut  the waitress ask if she was allerg  she said no but i do not like them  of cours the food was drop off quick by someon other than our waitress and by the time we realiz the the waffl were cover in nut there was no one to flag down  we final ask for the waffl to be switch out but by the time waffl without nut were brought out we were all done with our food  to make thing wors the waffl were cold  out of all the dish to make on the fli due to a mistak on the kitchen part the waffl shouldnt be someth that take the same time for the rest of us to finish our food to finish

our waitress comp the cold waffl but our bill was still crazi high for our mediocr experi  she was also high annoy and kept roll her eye when it came time to split the bill up at the end  i dont know if i would return here perhap if someon els was foot the billive heard a lot of good thing about bouchon brunch but i must say i was a littl let down while i was there the last time i was in vega although the restaur is difficult to find it is a rather love set whether your sit insid or outsid this time in particular i sat outsid and throughout the entir brunch we probabl onli saw our server 3 times

w were seat and it took about 15 minut for anybodi to even approach us we saw a male server hit up all the tabl around us except for our final a woman approach our tabl and take our order i ask for a coffe that took a while to get to the tabl i decid on get the corn beef hash with two egg which was recommend by our server and although the food came out in a time manner i didnt find anyth particular special about this dish it was even a littl bland and i want to ask for hot sauc but our server was out of sight for most of our brunch when i was final full and we were all readi to go our server came back to check on us to see if we need anyth els 

im sure there is a reason whi peopl love this place but i didnt see it the first time i was there food and servic just wasnt up to par the day i was thereoh le cirqu you disappoint me our perfect anniversari dinner was ruin by your incompet staff
   1hostess who didnt ask for my phone number or if we were celebr a special occas when i made a reserv so i had to tell her befor she hung up
   2 snobbi server who for some reason neglect us the whole night what did we do to deserv that
   3 whoever is respons for my entre come out 45 min after i was done with my apps
   4 manag who after listen to me said i should have waiv him down earlier to resolv the issu with the entre and our server whaaaat
    you guy have those five diamond hang on the wall i shouldnt have to waiv anyon down besid i find it extrem rude so we had 20 of our 400 bill taken care of pleas dont bother next timewaitther wont be next time 
   by the way make sure your server know your menu becaus that kobe filet is probabl 4oz not 8oz as i was told
    a good thing i can say about that place is that the sommeli and food runner were amaz both profession funni and veri attent they are the onli reason im ad a star
   overal how would you describ your experi when a veri special dinner goe to hell and it still make you realli upsetangryfrustr two month latermayb live in northern ca close to napa and sonoma has spoil me but base on the review in yelp as well as recommend from a friend  we made a reserv at le cirqu le cirqu was a huge disappoin we had a 915 reserv on a friday night we were prompt seat and the place was about 34 full the wait staff was not overt friend or energet nor veri effic kind of like our entir experi there i felt that perhap the le cirqu onc had her day but is now worn and in need of an eclect upgrad think gordon ramsey

w order a bottl of cakebread sauv blanc and it was pour near room temperatur this to me is a fatal error for a high end french eateri i ask them to bring a bucket of ice to the tabl which they did without complaint is was drinkabl in about 30 minutes

w order the 4 cours tast menu ehjust not impress the snow crab apett was decent but just as in ani good sushi place the next cours was a tini piec of foi gras which has carmel and serv over crisp bread perhap the best part of the meal as the john dori was cook dri and way under season think tilipia the rabbit breast was again cook to sawdust dri tasteless my wife had the duck breast which i tri it was much better but an extremley small portion

th other thing and i notic other yelper commnent on it was the long wait between cours at time uncomfort long our entir din experi was 2 hour and 45 minut when they brough the check and couldnt wait to pay and get the hell out of therecame here for a quick dinner befor club sinc it was in the same hotel as bodi english bad choice

first of all the servic was horribleit took liter forev to get water or even greet by a server they werent even that swamp but no one paid ani attent to our tabl for a good 15 minut i think we had to flag a few peopl down befor our waiter came by at least our food didnt take as long to come out but it still didnt make up for the sour first impression

veggi burger 995  the patti was realli thick and made with brown rice and chop up veggi it seem not what i was expect at all and not in a good way it also came with onion sprout and some kind of mayo the patti was kinda lukewarm in the middl and i didnt enjoy the tast muchblech the multigrain bun was good though and the fri were thick cut and well fri httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbcaw9akyx2rddrh9tmmkqselect4ozsuzxf6gttcjmjroqizg

pric here were not bad for vega standard but will i ever come back not unless it was the onli thing still openshibuya was chic and trendi and had a great atmospher no omakas was offer but they had a tast menu for 130 lil guy had udon with veget agedashi tofu 7 and an order of edamam 5

first cours trio of 2 slice of toro drizzl with a yuzu soy sauc tuna tartar with yuzu and avocado toro tartar stack with beluga caviar and gold flake i was impress with how my meal start everyth on this plate tast great and was beauti present although both the tartar kind of stuck to the plate when i tri to pick it up with my chopstick and i end up have to scrape it off with my chopsticks

second cours although it should realli be the 4th duo of hamachi and kanpachi the former consist of a garlic soy yuzu sauc while the latter was sit in a marinad of black truffl oil and yuzu again both were rather pleas to the palate

third cours or is it the 6th now beef tataki of thin slice kobe beef drizzl with a soy sauc infus with garlic paper thin sliver of fri garlic on each slice of beef were accompani with daikon sprout i didnt like the tast of the beef it just didnt tast like how raw kobe beef should tast  strong and rather off put the heavi sauc manag to mask the unpleas of the beef and the fri garlic help immens so it was still palat in the end

satay lobster in uni butter sauc as this dish was present also came with one larg scallop  slight overcook so it was a tad chewi i didnt think the satay complement the dish at all in fact it overpow the delic flavor of uni and end up make this dish mediocr at best 

beef short rib arriv veri artist present it includ white asparagus edamam caramel pearl onion and a small sliver of foie gras atop the beef i love the tast of the foie gras but the beef short rib was noth special it was no differ than good galbijim and therefor didnt impress

i have no idea whi they decid to add lobster to the miso soup becaus it did noth for it the miso soup itself was wateri and unflavor and the chunk of lobster meat was bland it hard to believ that a high end restaur like this couldnt present a tastier version of someth as simpl as miso soup

th final portion of the meal befor dessert was the sushi i thought it was excel that they gave you fresh wasabi becaus it definit enhanc the sushi experi howev i was extrem disappoint in the sushi itself the rice was still on the al dent side and the fish was also not of superb qualiti maguro and salmon were okay  ive had far better elsewher the hiram flounder was surpris grist it was chewi and crunchi not veri pleasant i enjoy the hamachi though it was almost butteri in textur i like the ume which accompani the sushi this cours was wonder present see photo

i was at the end of the meal portion and felt let down it start off with a bang but slowli went downhil how doe this happen in an establish such as this arent the cours suppos to build into a crescendo until it explod and then give the diner a sens of climax in the end

i guess the chef did somehow make it up with dessert becaus it was excel i be not a dessert fan had noth but great thing to say about the dessert trio which arriv the rich chocol ganach cake infus with sake was superb the other two name fail me were also good both had someth fruiti in it so it wasnt heavi at all

if i onli had the first two cours and then the final dessert i wouldv given them 5 star i thought servic couldv been better they brought me a refil of ice tea 3 onc and then forgot about it the cours also came out a tad too quick often befor id even finish the previous cours 

for a highend establish it was lack both in servic and the qualiti of food it was serv especi sinc i was pay 130 for the tast menu what truli rub me the wrong way was the fact that i order udon for the lil guy and the menu had shrimp tempura udon for 16 sinc lil guy didnt eat shrimp i ask if they could do it with veget instead the server told me sure they could but fail to inform me that i would be charg the same price if i had known i wouldv just order the shrimp tempura and ate it myself in the end i was charg 16 for plain udon with a few veget in it when i question the server his respons was it not on the menu wtf this type of custom servic is a reflect of poor manag just becaus someth is not on the menu doesnt mean you cant be flexibl and offer a servic to a custom when they ask for it but after you offer that servic you need to tell them that they would be charg the same amount and then let them make that decision

ordinarili it wouldv been a 3 star rate but overal they onli get a 2i was disappoint by  this place   i think this is more a tourist trap than an authent german restaur 
had the potato pancak with salmon  1399 4   jaegerschnitzel 1999  and pretzel 299 with mustard 039 
it didnt tast like german food at all   and it veri overpr wtf this place has realli gone downhill

i ate here twice last week and neither time was impress 

meal one my turkey burger was so dri and yucki that i onli ate the avocado off the top the burger was like hockey puck the bun was a littl stale the fri were okay the waitress did not notic my disdain 

meal two serious the worst grill chees panini i ever had the sweet potato fri were okay but didnt hold a candl to fez fri 

i do like purs hook at the bar 

i rememb a time when delux serv delici food that was well prepar and umactu tast good now two sucki sandwich later i long for the yesteryear of delux

even the a la care fri lost their charm

step it up delux you are lose medelux what did you do to yourself you get all these awesom review and then you let you asshol fall out 

the first two time i ate here pretti close to just after you open i had great food and good servic the grill chees was awesom and your burger tooth fri were good especi the sweet potato one 

the last 3 time i visit your bosom i was turn away by the uppiti unintellig servic staff and the lack luster food did i miss someth do you just not care about your appear anymor have you been turn out so long you are a use up toothless whore now i think so sorri honey ive found some new piec of ass 

keep on strolling

yelpshmoogl definit of cult on the web

 follow of an exclus system of religi belief and practic 

 fad an interest follow with exagger zeal he alway follow the latest fad it was all the rage that season 

 follow of an unorthodox extremist or fals religion or sect who often live outsid of convent societi under the direct of a charismat leader 

 a religion or sect that is general consid to be unorthodox extremist or fals it was a satan cult 

may i now introduc the regular custom of chino bandido

i am a huge fan of cheapass diner drive in and dive type of joint too but this place is so overr im just sick of hear about it

sur there are some flavor combin that you can get here that would be difficult to find elsewher but the slight novelti is not worth the trouble

if the fair averag tast food were good enough id be abl to overlook the locat in a strip mall that has futur home of north phoenix crack whore day labor center written all over it

if the portion were larg enough i could overlook the ugli and inconveni to eat out of pietin togo box that your food is serv in and the price that seem like a decent price onli until you get your food

if more of the bare cordial staff i encount were like the minor smiley and friend staff i could over look the stupid and arbitrari order system that one is expect to follow  there wasnt realli much help as some describ and whi should you need help order when you are just pick a meatriceformat combin anyway

although there are a few dish that are pretti tasti there is noth fusion about the menu asid from the fact that you can have your jamaican or chines entre roll into a burrito or cook into a quesadilla  
big whoop
it neither as much of a choic nor as satisfi as it seem like it should be  
all of these suppos choic combin and yet no brown rice

th redeem factor earn my second star was the friend youngster wash tabl chat up custom as they finish eat and he whisk away their garbag offer to bring them an extra cooki for the road

i also felt yucki about the whole inconsider nonpc atmospher surround the bandito panda and the takeeoute part of the name and im not a veri pc person in general  they may as well have put up poster of rairroad and raundri worker in pointe hat with rong pointe mustach say ahso you want extra starch in your revi to a grizzli old gold rush 49er

oh and just go and look for yourself at their health inspect reports

yeeshi so want to like this place but i was not a fan i got the combo with bbq pork and teriyaki chicken and chicken fri rice  the bbq pork was not good at all chewi and tough to eat  the teryiyaki chicken was even wors the sauc was a clump of jello like substanc  gross  the fri rice was so soggi and the bean did not go with the rest of the food  

they have a friend staff and hurdl custom in like cattli just didnt get it  the peopleservic are great  mayb i order the wrong menu item for my tast bud but i wasnt that impress with the food  and the pork had a bunch of fat  i had the cooki for mid afternoon snack and it was realli good  they certain have plenti of fan there was 2030 peopl in line at lunch the whole time i was thereno no no no no this is what my distend stomach has been scream ever sinc i went to this buffet tonight i get it you greedi piggi bastard you like quantiti over qualiti but how can you stuff your face like this 
i agre when it come to buffet it nicer qualiti than most but i still dont get the appeal person id rather have a nice good qualiti meal of a decent size mayb even with leftovers
a for vegetarian option forget it the rice risotto  mani of the other item you would expect to be safe have chicken stock in them we went here think i could get veget  side dish but my option were veri limit the 2nd star is for the chef who show me what i could eat even though he wouldnt listen when i said seafood is not vegetarian
aft this meal we decid we will never go to a buffet again it been 5 hour sinc i ate there  im still hurtmy gf suggest we eat here becaus they have better food which i suppos is impli by the higher price they charg for dinner 

this is not the case 

when your in vega or anywher realli you have to rememb that a buffet is a buffet is a buffet 

sure theyv got kobe not realli we arent in japan beef lamb sushi alaskan king crab leg snow crab flank steak shrimp cocktail

 but it all tast like buffet qualiti food which is a better way of say theyr most terribl 

do you know how difficult it must be to coordin a meal big enough to feed hundr if not thousand or peopl do you possibl think qualiti can be a factor in cook these meals

wher is the satisfact in get a thick slice of kobe beef if it so tough your knife cant get through it

lik king crab leg then youll hate them here sinc theyr all machinecut partial frozen and it tast like theyv been sit in a salt water bath for a week 

i wouldnt even mess with the sushi im veri veri picki about my fish and whatev they were serv here look one step abov the groceri store 

even the dessert were mediocr 

if you want to eat well in vega go look up a decent restaur and drop the 70 youd spend here there this last and i do mean last buffet visit prove onc and for all that no matter what theyr serv or charg noth beat pay for fresh made food it isnt worth cram subpar serv down your gullet just to justifi the cost of what you paid to get in here unless you have no discern tast or your just a big fatti who love to bing eat hey no judgment here do your thing then this just isnt the place to wast money in vegathe food is pretti good here but the buffet is overpr howev the price is expect sinc this is vega what realli bother me is the horrid service

th waitress sat my parti down and ask us what drink we want i ask for a soy milk and she roll her eye i let that slide sinc it didnt realli bother me howev she then said with an annoy tone are you serious this realli annoy me caus i felt like she was judg me she brought the drink while i was get food and told my friend that somebodi had to go out of their way to get the soy milk it doesnt matter if they have to go out of their way to get it becaus they are paid to do their job and i also paid for my meal

throughout the meal we also never got ani refil unless we ask for it and at some point nobodi even clean up our plate it realli felt like we did not have a waitress at all

thi has got to be the worst experi i have ever had at ani buffet the food may have been good but the servic was just that much worsas a vegan i could onli realli judg on the select of veggi and random veganfriend item buffet are usual my time to get creativ with what is avail to me the spice market buffet look especi fun sinc it featur your basic global cuisines

at the salad bar i stock up on grill bell pepper asparagus brussel sprout oliv and other veggi that were not veri memor next i perus the mexican food bar in hope to top certain veggi with guacamol unfortun the guacamol look sad grey and machin processed

th mideastern bar look much more promis while i fill my plate with hummus dolma tabouli pita and if i rememb correct some kinda of zucchini dish

overal i was glad that there was a suffici amount of option for me howev all of it tast as if these option were after thought noth veri excit here to top it off the staff all had this fml attitud about themselv from the cashier to the hostess to the server geez get a better job if you all hate it so much

th next day we went to le villag buffet at pari which was way better food servic and atmospher it made the spice market buffet look like a sizzlershould i chalk this up to a night of mishaps

 gave name at host stand quot 1520 minut given buzzer went to bar for drink 45 minut later check back at host stand to see what go on and hey our name have been accident cross off the list 
 due to the mishap we were offer the next tabl that becam avail one by the door on a cold and drafti night and yes i understand this place has doubl door but that doesnt mean peopl understand how to use them 
 order food it was decent i wasnt scream oh my god these chees curd tri bad appl in chicago the lazi susan with the herring was most great but the devil egg were terribl beer chees soup was over salti too 
 last all i realli want to tri was the chocol milkwhich was forgotten obvious to go with the theme of the night 

actual chalk it up to inattent servic due to the crowd of peopl that want to eat here next time i will go elsewherdear john

sinc we couldnt get a tabl till it becam god aw late we decid to sit at the bar and have our meal and it was our great misfortun to have land you as our bartenderwait i know you are a bartend and your job is to get us drink primarili but not fill a water glass for our entir dinner when your at the bar might be a cardin sin in your line of work you didnt offer us a dessert menu didnt take our order watch through the corner of your eye as we wait for some kind of attent and just general decid we were not worth your bartend time of day john you are not onli an aw bartend but might also be quit a terribl person 

we order from the vegetarianvegan menu for starter we had a tomato base soup with zucchini and basil probabl the onli good item for the night it was realli more of a reduct and not a soup but the point is it tast good my starter was the cocott parmigianno reggiano a custard made with strong parmesan flavor and top with mushroom and brussel sprout leav an intrigu present but sinc i left more than half of the thimbles portion im go to go with advis you not to order this 

for our main we got 2 half portion of risotto the whip veget risotto was not all that bad but i have noth resound to add about it the other risotto that compris pea asparagus and herb was an assault to everi tast bud i had one bite and i was done forev 

sinc john you did not bother to get us a dessert menu or take our order we were kind of put off and skip dessert 

1 star goe to your assist bartend gustavo who tri veri hard to make up for your inept 1 star goe to the fact that you offer 12 portion on the veganveg menu for all the pasta offer 

the abhorr servic and disastr food seal this place as a nogo on my vega italian list with sinatra a few yard away it absolut pointless to even step into this travesti known as bartollota

furthermor on our way back to the encor park lot my eye were assail by the line of peopl with copious amount of hair gel and the tightest most uncomfort outfit ever known to mankind tri to make their way into their mecca known as xcess

if anyon want italian here pleas make your way to sinatra and steer mile away from this joint 

sincerely
sangtwo star for the filet mignon which live up to expect and it high price point but sad i was disench with almost everyth els at sw steakhouse

th steak come with three sauc sw signatur sauc aka bbq béarnais and jalapeno fruit and their just seem to be someth off with all of them though the béarnais seem to be the best of the bunch appetizerwis we had the foie gras torchon mayb im so use to have foie gras that been sear but i thought this prepar poach did not offer much flavor and the sweet accompani white chocol biscuit and golden raisin and cherri that tast too boozey did not help

and of cours sinc steakhous are now all a la cart the side were extraa in 10 each extra though they were enough for two peopl to share if one person has a smallish appetit the au gratin potato were fine noth special

besid the meat the onli other thing i realli like was the breadbaguett and bacon and chees biscuitsand buttertop with oliv oil and hawaiian volcan salt

i was surpris that this place was pretti pack on a tuesday night we may be in a recess but appar that hasnt quit caught up with the expens account of all the invad conventionive been mean to come to sw steakhous for quit sometim now and after a fail attempt to get a reserv back in april i was determin to get one the next vega round 

we arriv a littl past our reserv but we were prompt seat in the outdoor seat area next to the waterfal which i might add was veri beauti and total compliment the dine experi they put on littl show for you as soon as the sun set they also have light reflect onto the water that chang in color so pretti 

appetizer
saute foie gras w grill pineappl brioch toast and blackberri jam oh what a dish this was the foie gras was perfect sear not burn like the last foie gras i had the pineappl ad a nice contrast to the foie gras at first i wasnt too sure itd be a good combin but it was also the blackberri jam compliment the foie gras veri well

im go to need more water
42oz chili rub doubl ribey like cherylynn n mention this dish was featur on food network the best thing i ever ate so we had fair high hope for this dish so disappoint  the chili rub was way too overpow too salti too much season it was just too much and too much of someth cant alway be good  i found myself have to drink a coupl of glass of water becaus the rub was too overbear and took away from the steak flavor im shock that this would be on the best thing i ever ate becaus this didnt come anywher close to be the best thing i ever ate oh might i add that our steak was overcooked

sideliners
black truffl cream corn parmesan cream spinach mac n chees fingerl potato w green bean  bacon our of all the side i thought the mac n chees was the best whi becaus i like mac n chees that good enough for ya x 

there alway room for dessert
funnel cake  strawberri w anglais salti caramel and fudg sauc thank god for dessert this was the best out of all the dish we had the funnel cake was soft and warm and when dip in ani of the 3 dip sauc was like take a bite of heaven 

hi yes were still here service
so our waitress was mia more than half the time i dont rememb her check on us at all but i watch her multipl time go to tabl where older custom were seat and check up on them the onli time we saw her was when we place our order when our friend had to complain about his steak becaus it was way overcook and when she hand us the bill a restaur in the wynn lack servic in their restaur im shock 

overcooked
ah now you must be wonder about the overcook steak if not you better start to wonder x jk all joke asid our friend had to send his steak back becaus his steak was cook welldon instead of mediumrar how in god name doe a steakhous overcook a steak how can you call yourself a steakhous if you cant proper cook a steak i dont understand 

our waitress then ask our parti if everyon steak was cook to their like but she said it in a tone a tone like ugh f anyon els flip the bird whatev lady

conclusion
nev come back here im so disappoint the restaur is a beauti one but beauti cant mask what truli insid and what truli insid an mia waitress and overcook steak the foie gras dessert and enchant waterfal could not save this review from be 2 star becaus i didnt come here for either one of those thing i came here for a good steak and that not what i got all i got was a bag full of disappointthis is for the downstair section

worst servic ive experienc in a restaur in over a decad   when you read this youll think i have incred good luck becaus it wasnt near as horrif as some of the stori ive read on other review for other restaur but for my own experi this was incred insulting

ent josef this is what the receipt said for the cashier so im go by that  if he was around more often i might have been abl to catch his name myself   the meal start with my be intrigu by an option on the cocktail menu that was dealer choic in that the bartend would creat a drink for you   im adventur enough to tri it but i did want to first know if there was a chanc id get some fruiti concoct   our server seem a littl annoy at this but ultim he said he could provid the bartend some slight guidanc whiskey base and that was that  ill be honest and say this didnt rub me the wrong way at the time but in retrospect it was foreshadow in nature

when he return my drink was sort of a take on a manhattan and i enjoy it quit a bit  so far so good  take our food order i felt like he kept tri to upsel us on the menu both with appet suggest and then barrag me with the idea of ad scallop to my sea bass entre  no mean no josef  3 nos later and he had our order in  our food was brought out and we start eat   pretti sure we didnt engag with josef from that point forward until he tri to sell us on dessert  in the meantim my friend drink sat complet empti for near the entir meal at least half an hour and mine for about 15 minut of that also sat empti  id love to say that there could have been an excus for this but when im see the guy visit the tabl immedi to our left and right multipl time each and discuss thing like his son hobbi and other extrem interest topic all the while there just noth to say except for that hes an aw server   im definit insinu someth when i say that those two coupl seem to be order up quit a storm and im think our reluct to bite on the upsel might have made us less import  shame becaus what we lack that night in hunger we would have easili made up for in thirst quench 1015 cocktail   in fact when he final did show his face again to ask if we need anyth els he still didnt ask if we want our drink refresh   appar josef thought we were of the cacti family

for what it worth i enjoy my fish quit a lot   it was cook to perfect and the sauc and other compon present realli pull it togeth  subtl but delici  be ignor though lessen the qualiti of the meal overal to where i just stop care about the food and start plan my yelp vengeanc   

this was probabl our 4th or 5th visit and is our last for the time be  id consid return but onli if i could verifi that he would not be our server  thank guy

4 star for the food 2 star for josef exist on this planetcome here if you like incens and a pretenti crowd hey sometim i do  

i wasnt impress by the fr loung for a few reasons

1 slow it took about 30 minut befor a server ask what wed like to drink  and the saddest part is that this was befor rush hour everi other drink order came 20 minut too late

2 i was tri to nibbl off of my salad on the veri edg of the coffe tabl becaus it was full of other massivelys plate  no room left for anyth els my prici salad becam a floor accessori  the server so kind took my plate away but offer noth in return  no redo no discount new salad

3 we had two member at our tabl and in the later night we end up in a reserv space where we were pretti much seclud in the worst way possibl no servic again  the reason they claim the reserv space is for bottl servic onli  500 bottl of wine is normal in lv i get it but on this fine night not one of the 6 peopl in our group want wine  but in order to get anyth els we had to walk out of the reserv space go down stair go to the bar and order ourselves

th view here is great as are the dessertsbut this is vega competit is fierc  odd are youll find a better spot elsewherdenni qualiti food with las vega quantiti price  passbreakfast is a tricki littl busi on the strip most casino offer starbuck or a grand buffet and not much in between so red white and blue appeal to me for the casual conveni factor it is part grabandgo deli with a sit down café on either side and although there was a line it move quick so i was abl to easili grab a tabl for our group 

we all end up choos the american breakfast choic of egg bread sausag or bacon and juic definit pricey at 16 and it was your basic forgett breakfast most of our meal in vega fell into the expens and worth it or expens and not categori this would be the latter servic was disinterest at best by far our best breakfast on the trip was no where near the stripdennysslow servic ok foodexpens pricesbut cheaper than a fine dine experiencei wont be backim a foodi and i prefer to spoil myself on place like n9newell uh ok i hate to be the one to do this but im base my review off of what the server man put in front of me ok here we go had just arriv at this casino met my sweeti was real late and neither one of us had dinner so we head into the grand lux cafe 

im in the mood for soup didnt like their soup option so i decid to have their zen noodl after read the menu descript i realiz theyr talk about pho i say yes that perfect definit will hit the spot so our server bring my noodl and i immedi notic that the bean sprout look not so fresh so i poke my finger into them and eeeeewmushi i spoon a tast of broth and omg are you kid me this tast like chicken broth out of the can i say whoa now i am so not go to eat these noodl so we call over the waiter ask him to send it back and to bring back a menu i said pleas i felt bad for do this but i usual pay around 5 for a good bowl of pho in the bay area and they were charg 14 the manag came over and apolog profus and took care of us from there on good manag obvious the best thing here on out is if i want a bowl of pho then i will onli order from a noodl shopnot so lux 25  im not a fan of commerci chain and it definit wasnt my choic to come here valu wise it sux becaus it in vega it pricey for what it is which isnt much if it was in suburban hoboken this would be a happen spot i can just pictur some jersey chick chain smokn and down the best eva flat bread sandwich oh my gawdim from the bay area where the first lee sandwich first open so i must say it an accomplish that theyd open one down here when the bread is hot and fresh it realli good but onc theyr cool theyr so freak stale and  hard im sit at the tabl eat the baguett sandwich tri to chew on the bread as if i was a hobo that hasnt ate in forev the onli item that are actual good are the smoothi becaus it actual someth fresh i recommend raspberrycarrot i use to work there so i made a lot of concoct i suggest the italian soda too oh and avoid the fat old man that cashier sometim hes so rude and doesnt handl custom well he make everyon first experi at lee a complet and total disast 

if your someon who want to order wingseggrol call ahead of time befor you come in they say it take 510 minut it actual take like 20 and there no wifi even though the websit say they do they dontwe decid to dine at veneto trattoria for my farewel dinner and unfortun it was incred disappoint 

the staff clear are not train in custom servic or restaur etiquett eg grate chees on the ladi dish first refil water glass etc  they hung around the bar area and eye us as we progress through the meal  i couldnt understand a word that our waiter said and he complet disregard the specif of my question  he could hard rememb the night special of the vagu unintellig list about seven dish all i caught was chill tomato soup

short thereaft diner at an adjac tabl inquir about the type of pasta on the menu  mr ego condescend respond what kind of pasta do you like  they went back and forth sever time until the custom decid against pasta altogeth  i dont blame him what a hassl  

the food was complet underwhelm and over salt  portion were unimpress and basic thing like mash potato and pasta obvious origin from a box  the chicken scallopen was soso the meager serv of veggi were the star  i had a tast of some shell pasta with spici sausag it was unremark 

dont wast your time or money on overpr lacklust food serv by a snitti  impati waitstaff  sorri fellow yelper i just wasnt impress i am not compel to returni hate to be a jerk but i am not a fan when i think mexican food i envis spici food that make my nose run and bold flavor that danc along my tongueunfortun my dream were crush at tia rosa so with that said if you have super bland tast which there is noth wrong with that or love sweet sugari syrup on your taco then this is the place for you if not stay awayi realli want to like you but you spill my boyfriend soda and clean up your counter but not my boyfriend glass and upon check in you told us to sit outsid and have a drink as we wait and told us youd rememb to come and get us when our tabl was readi but you forgot about us and mark us off as seat so we wait an hour and had no food boo mayb this just wasnt meant to beahcibo i was realli expect to be won over by this place and would have been if it wasnt for the horribl servic from our waiter jame drink and appet were love so we ask jame for pizza recommend he recommend the di nott and the capriccosa initi i was put off by the artichok list on the capricossa but after a quick consult with my boyfriend we decid it would be fine and follow those recommend our pizza arriv the di nott and vegetariana wait what

w left the vegetariana untouch and call jame over to correct the mistak he caus a big loud and embarrass scene present as defens and aggress as he rais his voic and refus to correct the error he insist that we had order the vegetariana becaus we didnt want the artichok on the capricossa when we point out there were artichok on the vegetariana and that it wasnt our pizza jame said well theyr onli on one quadrant of the pizza you want me to pick them off for you

when there is a tabl of 12 to verifi a stori and two costum have a differ version of the event than the server i think it time to admit the mistak and move on i was shock by his behavior and appar so was some of the other staff as they came over to apolog for his rude i have never been treat so poor in a restaur befor which is not someth i had ever expect to say about cibo

th food and ambianc were wonder but if servic is poor it ruin the experi and make me reluct to spend money here again mayb id consid if we could get melissa as our waitress who remain sweet and attent and made effort from the cash bar to make us feel welcom again servic is such a key element in a restaur and our server was entir blind to this factalthough i guess it didnt matter much to him sinc his gratuiti was alreadi ad inive got to say im surpris at the stark differ between fez and switch  im a huge fan of switch and have never had a bad experi a big plus is that it is walk distanc  on the contrari for fez ive been there 4 time and all four time ive had dread servic yes dread with a capit d  the food is what i would expect from this owner but by time it get to me im so  piss off about the bad servic that i overlook the good qualiti great tast and posit use of qualiti ingredi  i cant help but think to myself that if i want a good burger without the queeni attitud ill go to delux for their burger and sweet potato fri  
last night was the ice on the cake though not onli did we have bad servic and dayold wine but we were sit next to a group of queen who were like oh my gawd girl did you see what jeffi was wear at amsterdam last night like wow i thought that went out in the 80s  yea and here i thought valley girl talk went out in the 80s too  and then the one of them scoot out of the booth and near knock my 3 month old nephew out of his chair and say oopsi sorry
i think ill stick to switch and ticoz when im in the mood fo recess food   
and for those of you who dont know what that last sentenc mean the owner of these three restaur has initi a recess plate special   it appar last for the entir month and is the most delici 5 meal ive had in age  it so good and cheap that i can afford to order the best wine on the menuwow im surpris to see such good review on this place  i thought that the food was mediocr at best  i had the fez burger just okay and my husband had the panko chicken  they had some interest flavor combin on their entre but they just werent execut well  everyth was realli bland   we order the garlic fri and boy were they disappoint  basic your run of the mill fri with garlic powder yes garlic powder and bare ani salt or pepper  i guess i just assum that garlic fri would have real garlic like real restaur do  i guess peopl like this place becaus it trendi but the food doesnt hold up to the atmospher at allive been itch to go to fez for a long time base on all the other wonder review i drive by fez near everi day as i work just down the street  

final went with a buddi of mine and i got razz more than id like for pick out a subpar place that is factor in the food and the servic id probabl give 25 3 star for the food id give 15 star for the servic  went on a sunday afternoon and it wasnt busi at all although the servic would have suggest otherwis now dont get me wrong the waitress was veri pleasant and person but the time that went by befor we got refil or that my dine companion diet coke was fix to a regular coke took too long me not be a soda drink couldnt care less about diet vs regular but i know i know you soda drinker need to have it exact as your tast bud know 

the food i alreadi had a lunch so just got the kisra and hummus  i must  say i was extrem impress with the tast of the kisraactuallyi would come here for the kisra and hummus for lunch for sure but i would get it to go i wouldnt come back on a lazi sunday afternoon bc although im be lazi i dont want the servic lazi  on to my friend lunchh got the allamerican burger to me this should have come on a sesam seed bun what more american other than appl pieright  now i understand the mediterranean flair that is fez but it just didnt seem right to call it allamerican when it more like halfamericanand his salt and pepper fri were not even warmish and they tast reheat boo

w both decid this would mayb have been a better time had if we were there in the even i think well give it one more tri at night and see if we dont enjoy it a littl more

mayb my hope were built up bc of all the other great review mayb we came at a bad time mayb he order the wrong item mayb ill give fez anoth shotbut im not in a hurri to do that right nowthis place was a huge disappoint  with all the posit review i was expect such a better experi  i came in for a nice goodby lunch with my  bf and experienc such lacklust service
w walk in and the place was reason full for a weekday lunch and we wait for a few moment befor anyon at the bar even took notic  final a guy lydel walk by a show us to our tabl  he plop down the menus short ask us what we want to drink and left  a few moment later he slam down our water ask us if we know what we want  we bare had a chanc to even open the menu  i dont know whi he was in a rushi doubt his shift was go to end ani time soon  we werent sure of when he would be back so we put in an order for the infam sweet potato fri and an afternoon marg for the bf  again quick servic but definit not friend  the fri and drink were pretti much thrown onto the tabl  what up lydel  have a bad day  dont take it out on me  so we put in our order for the chicken phyllo packet and the fez salad and fez kirsa  then we did into the fries
i was excit becaus i absolut love sweet potato fri  but these were just mediocr if not bad  they were lukewarm and the dip sauc tast like an orang creamsicl  it was way too sweet for my tast  i was hope for a savori aioli to counter the incred sweet  the phyllo packet were anoth disappoint  the sauc seem so water down and again they were just lukewarm  then the entre cameth kirsa was again lukewarm  do they not own a real oven in this place  ughi order hot food and expect it to be hot  at that pointalong with lydel attitud and him assum that i want a half salad becaus i should not be eat as muchim over this place
i was glad to leav the crappi loud hous music behind as wellafter come to phoenix i realiz that good review dont necessarili mean good food i expect a crowd room when come to fez on a saturday morn for brunch but it was pretti scarc both insid and on the patio i was so disappoint with my egg benedict egg benni is one of my favorit weekend treat of all time and when done wrong i am a veri sad girl the egg werent poach right and end up in a littl puddl next to the toughtochew baguett the slice of ham look like lunch meat and overal the dish was pretti aw two star goe for their grapefruit cocktail which was tasti i wish i could have trade my benedict for more drink 

sorri fez just didnt cut it for mei love fez and it is kill me to give them 2 star  whi  the servic was just flat out aw  our annual christma meet up was not a good experi  the food was still great as alway  we sat for 10 min befor anyon came by  then anoth 10 min befor our drink made it to the tabl and we order  never saw the server again to get a refil until the food arriv  then we had to flag anoth server down for anoth refil  they said they will get our server  mayb 5 min or more then the our server show up  i am so bumtldrthey make a great burger but that probabl about it 

at this point it realli goe without say that the fez burger is one of the best you can find in this town if fez were just a burger place id end my review with five star and tell them to just take my money when lunch time roll around at 11 and 14 with fri sinc when are fri a premium and not the default side dish it pricey but you are get good quality

but fez is more than just a burger joint and the further it stray from what it doe right the more disappoint i was afflict with new american as it often call is a genr of food that borrow a foreign cuisin and make it friend to your unadventur palat here the motif is northern africa where you can sampl the flavor of kisra and harissa 

the super spici hummus look cours enough to warrant high expect it just look so fresh and housemad that i couldnt wait to dig in i know spice get tone down for american food but i realli expect it to mean more than mild flavor and ton of salt the herb in the flatbread were not compat with the hummus in ani way but generous slice of cucumb somehow save it from be a total disaster

mi honeydew margarita tast likewel a regular margarita im not so sure they rememb to add anyth to it it was just alright i understand they special in martini but that doesnt mean you get to slack on the rest

sweet potato fri were overr half way through i notic the faint crunch from the ton of ad sugar that was just dump on it was definit overkil and the sweet dip sauc didnt help i will not order these again

atmospher was vagu modern but still bland if you want to boast music as part of it stop blast radiosaf hit from 15 year ago and get with a cool uptod playlist servic felt rush but id rather have it be swift than slow manag doe well but a kitchen that tri to do too much leav much to be desirnot a huge fan the servic was ok noth special noth bad the build was ok a littl dirti the pizza was a disappoint 

the crust is good but realli didnt have much flavor the sauc oh wait what sauc there was zero i actual ask for a side of sauc the chees was just enough to cover the top and noth more the top were ok meh 

price were ok i guess

ov hype mayb bad day maybweeeeeeeell that might be it for me at llxatwood 
just one too mani thing sour my dine experi today
not certain i can go back 

i walk in admit toward the end of the lunch rush and was astonish that near everi tabl was cover with dirti dish now ive work in restaur i understand when your hit hard it can be challeng to keep up with tabl that need to be buse ive also eaten in a lot of restaur which make me qualifi to say thing like tabl cover with dirti dish dont scream welcom sit yourself down your in for a treat the waitress gave me a warm welcom encourag me to sit anywher i want but given my choic a clean tabl or a dirti one there were two two tabl in the entir restaur to choos from 

thing got wors from there 

mi egg roll was undercook cold on the insid and doughi whi doughi no clue but doughi 

the wonton in the wonton soup were melt in your mouth and not in a good way melt in your mouth becaus the dumpl were overcook no bite no chew 

and while their version of pad thai was tasti at 3 star which ought to be moder was so spici i had to ask for sever addit napkin waitress must have thought i said sever more spice becaus she brought two over iron unfortunate

also unfortun is the fact that this place is so drastic differ than llxwilli it bigger and the hour are better but neither are enough to make me want to give them anoth go after todaywhere to starti realli realli want to like this place  it was our first time here and we like to tri a new place on date night so we went here after hear some pretti great thing  

the host was nasti right away which should have been the first sign

w were seat downstair for dinner dure happi hour when everyon was upstair  this was kind of nice hear the music and nois but have the restaur to ourselv  

our waitor was realli great veri friend and super help  we order an app and i got the seafood platter off menu and the bf got a steak  

instant we realiz the food just wasnt prepar great or wasnt top qualiti  the steak came out a bit cold which was shocking

w couldnt do dessert i just cant have someon destroy that for me  all in all we spent about 120 with tip and just wish we had not even bother not a fanthis place alway look crowd from the outsid hmmm if it this crowd all the time this place must be a great place to check out or mayb not 

did i just get a kid cup of beer for 6  

whi is it crowd outsid but not insid mayb everyon is tri to leav the place but no one is move out the way 

i wonder if the food is good here though becaus the wing and nacho look good 

time to move on i was out of there as soon as i got my drinki was total underwhelm  and total shock given all the except review from other trust yelp elites

th rice was weird there were frozen pea carrot and green bean in it and i swear the rice was uncl ben 

they dont realli have chip they broke up some tostada and put them on a plate how weird 

2 star for the authent and qualiti of the food lack of chip price not in line with the level of qualiti of the food and total overdon vibe

overal not great over price overdon and weirdstingray is everyth that is wrong with sushi in america this place is just for young dumb pretti thing and the douchebag that hunt them to go for a quick bite befor hit 7 differ club it is a bastard and dumb down of the sushi experi that leav 1000s of peopl walk away say yeah ive had sushi sake bomber raw fish big deal it fun

sushi isnt raw fish it a vinegar rice prepar in a specif manner to achiev perfect textur and flavor that rice is then accompani by various top often raw fish but you could eat an entir meal of real sushi and never touch raw fish 

both time that ive fuck up and gone here the sushi rice has been pathet onc so undercook it was crack in my teeth the next so mushi and oversweeten it tast like dessert

onc sat at the bar to tri to get a littl interact with a chef i ask him what sashimi he recommend his answer it all come in fresh daili whatev wrong answer tall white doofus chef

sr get an extra star for be semicool look for a rock n roll sushi bar and appear to be clean in the front anyway and if you order the right stuff it give you someth color to throw up later in the bathroom at myst

if you want real sushi hiro in scottsdal shiro in pv  multipl other venu some ive yet to tri but are get good report hell even in a set like the metreon in sf sanraku is good japanes there seem to be a boom again thank but ayako at the biltmor will be miss for a veri long time

i could copypast this same review for zen32 and ra whi retyp almost exact the same complaintdear sushi mon

what has happen to you  i was your number one fan  ive had over 50 meal with you and fill up eight allyoucaneatcard with 10 stamp each  

late youv slip ive definit notic the last four or five time ive visit you  im not sure if it the economi so your not sell the fish fast enough or sacrif some qualiti to save money  

but that wouldnt explain whi you would tri to serv me nigiri on plain white rice last time i was there  did you run out of vinegar to make the sushi rice

i havent seen my favorit of your sushi chef jr in a long while  mayb my time is off  but it also seem the old angri sushi chef is angrier and slower than ever  must he put up his hand to shush me if i tri to ask him for more than one order at a time  i wouldnt have to place simultan order if he didnt take 8 minut to prepar each item i request  on a slow night

thank for the memori sushi mon  we definit share some good time  ill alway rememb your ikura and ahchichi rolls

sincerly
richi hayc sushi ayct servic  all you can tolerate

a lot of the sashimi i order was chewi which is a horribl adject to use for raw fish  the usual mayonaiss bath overr roll were present too but what make this place go from averag to subpar is the service

our waitress look veri irrit each time she came by our tabl  she drop off our food at the tabl next to us and then attempt to bring it to us after the diner had been poke at it in confus  item were forgotten and never brought out and no apolog were ever offer  

mi biggest issu here is that it say all over the menu we charg for leftov food includ rice 45 minut time limit  if your go to impos strict eat guidelin on your custom at least present them with a pleasant experi and decent food  

there are mani ayc place in town i wouldnt return to this onewhen they mean sugar and ice they are not kid in prepar for my upcom vega trip i thought it was time for me to catch up on my vega review sinc i am look for advic on where to go as well  

avoid this place tourist trapsur it may look pretti and entic but it is fail this is not gelato i have been all over europ last year 11 countri and this place is a joke and the price is pretti high

mi new goal of late is to tri as mani new place as possibl and to let peopl know what to expect  the review were deceiv and i was expect some delici gelato but found myself stand there with 2 scoop and a chocol waffl cone for 10 are you kid me for that price i could get 10 virgin pina colada in ani hotel just by tip the server  the cone was too sugari  their chocol coat didnt even tast like real chocol but waxi sweet that was not worth the money or calori  i have yet to find a good gelato place in vega  dont fall for the pretti case lolwe pick this place as our fine dine option sinc we were stay at caesar and didnt want to spend our mortgag at guy savoy also consid mesa by bobbi flay but was turn off by their ridicul credit card requir for reservations

read about their prefix menu on yelp and it look promis we found they dont offer it unless you ask for it which was rather tacki servic was spotti and unattent ambianc was not conduc to fine dine between the tv at the bar the loud music and the tabl practic next to the casino floor

between my husband and i we tri 6 differ dish plus the sear foie gras  the best dish besid the foie gras was their caesar salad which was veri authent and made from scratch

th blue chees souffl was pleasant but noth to write home about it need some honeycomb to counter the salti of the chees the sear foie gras also need a sweet sauc in addit to the sourish berri sauc the roast petaluma chicken bad need a sauc it was serv next to some mushi pasta i think that was what it was 

it onli been a coupl of week and i can bare rememb the dish we ate it was just that a forgett meal noth was bad yet noth stood out i recent learn they are close soon that explain the lack of attent to detail in a place like thiswow has this place gone downhil sinc the last time i was here okay it has been about 23 year ago but you would think that they would onli get better we came here on sunday afternoon for their brunch it wasnt our first choic but the wait was shorter here compar to the buffet at bellagio i paid 40 and it was definit not worth it

highlight of my meal french toast tuna cevich with jicama but small chunk of tuna cocktail shrimp madelin pretti moist

lowlight of my meal tuna hand roll gross bloodi prime rib servic suck wait in line for mediocr food

th last time i was here i did love the butternut squash ravioli too bad they didnt have it this time 

check out my friend paulin ls more detail review httpwwwyelpcombizthebuffetatthewynnlasvegas2hridctlbdxecv42gqi7c4jjkpqthis is my 2nd time at the breakfastbrunch buffet at the wynn and it was the same both time  im not sure whi i bother again  mayb becaus i kept on hear peopl say this place is good and i thought i should give it anoth try

it not as good as bellagio  or rio  or m casino buffet for seafood  but not here  the ingredi arent as fresh and exquisit as they could be for buffet fare  im not expect jesus fare  im expect decent qualiti for vega  

i expect a larger asian select too  fail  should have eaten somewher elscame here for lunch on a monday and was veri disappointed

th buffet  wynn use to be one of the best on the strip  the main reason is becaus of the creativ of the menu  they offer great entre and stuff that you couldnt get at other buffet on the strip

to some extent the buffet  wynn still doe that for it patron  you can get indian and thai food here for exampl  the problem is that the qualiti of the indian and thai is below averag  

qualiti of the meat have drop as well   i felt that they didnt tast fresh  even marin meat tast dull  

i regret to inform you guy that there was not one dish that i tri that i thought was memor  i didnt get second of anyth this time which is pretti horribl  if you are pay upward of 30 you should realli expect a top qualiti buffet  unfortun you dont get that here and my review reflect that  

instead of this buffet i recommend bellagio buffet or wick spoon   i love wick spoon becaus of it creativ entre and i love bellagio for it amaz dessert  i increas notic that m buffet is generat a lot of buzz as a possibl 3rd option  if you want great seafood bellagio and m buffet may be your best bet  if you do howev choos to go to the buffet  wynn just consid yourself warn  i take no pleasur in report that qualiti has droppedit just is what it isi came here super excit sinc the wynn has such a high rave buffet of vega and from mani satisfi friend though there was not a line when my boyfriend and i arriv and plenti of tabl all around it took a good 30 minut befor we got seat alright ill let it slide this time so got seat and order a pink lemonad mix with sprite becaus i was so thirsti from the desert heat when i gulp up my first glassm i head toward the food 

the way i usual eat at buffet is ill walk around the whole area see what they got then mental divid and pair up which food ill get togeth in each trip start off with some pasta i love me some pasta i got the tortellini and notic they had a madetoord pasta station oooooooh there was a line so i decid to come back let just say that tortellini and the cocktail shrimp were the best of the entir buffet the ravioli i got at the pasta station after tast like shit they onli had 2 soup choic where other buffet have at least 4 the corn on the cob was so soggi and greasi the select at the wynn buffet is so minim there wasnt much to eat 

not to mention that the plate werent all fulli clean i came across two plate my entir meal that had speck of sauc on it still i left still hungri i should have went to bellagiorealli yelp 4 star can you say overr 

so im usual wari of all you can eat buffet becaus the qualiti of food is often mediocr at most but i decid to reli upon the yelp review first off we came here for brunch it okay we had girl in the group xd and it cost us 37 each pretti steep price also the line went on for about 1 hour final when we were seat it took a while for the hostess to get our drink as for the food skip the asian section as for the steak it was chewi and not season well enough the smoke salmon was pretti good and the shrimp was solid as for the dessert i grab one of everyth they look great howev everyth just tast like color sugar 

overal i was pretti disappoint i guess ill be stay away from buffet in vega for awhilmy friend brought me to the buffet at wynn for lunch honest after my last experi with le villag buffet i was a littl apprehens 

we had a one hour wait in line grant it was dure lunch hour i was beyond hungri that i lost my appetit when we final reach the front of the line it was close to 2pm if it wasnt for the pretti decor in the hotel which is exquisit sharr wouldv been extra crabbi we paid upfrontther were 3 of us and the bill was 125 this shit better be good

i was realli impress by the layout of the food station especi the dessert station which was outrag i realli want to start with dessert first but everyth els look so damn good too they even had differ station for intern flavor 

after about 30 min or so i have tri pretti much a littl bit of everyth the sushi station was good howev i didnt want to get full on rice but i did get second on stir fri tofu and pumpkin ravioli the meat here are onc again veri dri what is go on with the meat peopl get it right 

the big hoorah for me was the dessert i coudnt wait to get my hand on them each littl pastri was so pretti and beauti decor  i came close to get one of each lol when i got back to my tabl and actual bit into one of them it was a marshmallow i near spit it back out how long have they been sit there it was near rancidthat stuff was not fresh then i was brave enough to tri the restal i can say is eh i realli expect a lot from this place but my hope were shut down it all about glitz and glamour again with empti promis boooo sharr is extra crabbi now more than ever 

im readi to throw in the towel with the serach for best buffet in vega if anyon have ani suggest pls pm me be warn howev im veri pickiwow an hour plus wait in the queue and big disappoint in experi the flower were more pleasant than the actual edibles

besid the flawless prime rib bacon waffl a chines shrimp panko spring rolland an outstand buttermilk mapl fri chicken  perfect i was not terribl impressed

sushi hard core suck dessert were not good insid of the middl room a rich chocol shotglass passabl shotglass cheesecak also an eh but the cardamom pistachio creme anglais and the tapioca pud were outstand  found next to the sushi odd enough

weekend brunch end at 3pm 33 a head steep and not worth it for the qualiti of food presented

no crab leg no cajun seafood this past sunday bum deal

wick spoon faaaaar surpass the buffet and that my foodi four cent worthwow this buffet is so shitti im write this review at my tabl this place has good review and friend said it was good so we decid to tri it came at 1pm on a saturday and got sat about 2pm the wait was brutal but expect it was about 100 for two peopl includ drink so pretti averag the food select was horribl old stale pizza nasti chicken old asian food pretti much everyth was old im eat with 3 peopl who all hate their food as well even buffet with shitti food are usual ok in some way but this place has noth good to offer the food doesnt even look appet to start with the onli thing that look decent is the dessert but i havent tri them just yet so 2 star for that the decor is old and the tabl is so so far away from the food it suck dont bother here go to wick spoon so far it was the best 



just tri the dessert and they suck too the best part of this buffet was my pineappl slice and the fact that my mimosa kept cominfive star for faker pretenti and for the gentleman crap poor prepar poor execut no disciplin

just forget it certain not worth the  100ppi want to like this place the coffe is better than most place in town they have vegan bake good and it just a few block from my hous if i want to chat with a friend or read a book it definit a good place to go

butthi is a univers town i am a student and i need my internet access to be consist im fine with restaur and cafe not offer internet but mother fool is just a teas if there are more than a few peopl use the connect it fizzl out and i cant use my comput even wors i mention the problem to an employe and she told me that internet is seen as a courtesi here and not someth they have to provid sure  they dont have to provid it to custom but it seem like they get a lot of busi from wifi user and mayb they could get more from peopl like me if we knew the internet was work at all timeyou know when i am dine at a 5 star hotel forgiv me but i am expect to be impress and pampered

not here  this place was horrid  

let begin with the 2 airhead hostess who stood there for 5 minut and talk to each other while we wait to be seat  ok i understand that theyv got a whole complic system go of how to seat peopl but they at least could have told us how long it was go to be rather than ignor us

th real troubl began when we final sat at our tabl  10 minut after we had decid what we were order and close our menus to give the signal i had to flag down one of the busser to notifi whoever our server was so we could order   well he must have forgotton becaus it took anoth 5 for our waitress to come  the restaur was not busi at this time 330pm mind you  yes we hadnt even been greet yet  we didnt even have water  again peopl a five star hotel were talk about here

aft order we had to ask for bread 3 timesw had to send one soup back becaus it was the wrong onejust to send the correct soup back becaus it tast so poorthey forgot my friend mojitoand i had to get up and walk to anoth tabl to steal some extra silverwar becaus i couldnt flag down anyon who work there  our busser john was the onli one who seem to have it togeth but he was realli busi hold the place down sinc everyon els wasnt helping

in the end we actual ask john if he could send a manag over so we could complain becaus our experi was so bad and she end up comp the entir meal after hear about all of the inconsist and disappoint  i would feel guilti about this at an independ restaur but cmon  this is the wynn were talk about  they should have everi aspect of the way they run their anyth down to an art by now  no excus  and this was a trend at the wynn  veri disappoint with the wynn servicenot just here but also at okada and red as well  even the conveni store servic was whack

th onli reason i am give 2 star is becaus that bloodi mari came in clutch and my french fri were goodthe best part about this restaur is the bread it was warm 

the doubl bread chicken tender appet with buffalo sauc were realli doubl bread it was eat a chicken sandwich with extra bread it was veri fill they could have done it with one less coat the sauc was way too tangi the kind of tangi that make you cough if you were to breath in the scent of the sauc upon eat it 

the asian chicken salad was a joke the chicken was dri and the cabbag and dress was bad 

the mushroom chess burger that my friend had look good then again how can you realli screw up a burger this place would onli be good if you were drunk out of your mind and you were starv if you were to come here without these condit then i dont recommend that you come here it hard to believ that a 5 star hotel like the wynn have such a bad cafe extra star for the view of the pool view and the servicthe drone of hope millionair wane as the six of us dip into the panel honeycomb of bellagio steakhous prime we had drift away from the hoot and holler of night owl and seem onto the set of a high budget film that hadnt decid whether it focus was old hollywood gone with the wind or french victorian blue velvet drape careen from ceil to floor bust from a girdl of gold chord that could easili fashion scarlett next dress fountain flit outsid the window like children intent on a game of tag and ad just enough disneyland amus to complet this abstract portrait 

despit swivel head and rubber neck we arriv at our tabl unscath and dwarf by an immens paint resembl venuss sister stare wideey at our plate to ensur we ate all our veget an ocean of carpet thick enough to swallow ani sign of drop silverwar necessit alic in wonderlandlik gold knocker on the back of each chair for easi tow 

audit for the stereotyp role of jeev our waiter ascend with a rais nostril of disgust scene 1 snif dirti sweat sock and upon order drink scene 2 serv a stiff cocktail of content one of my culinari colleagu murmur i feel like the waiter think hes better than me 

we laugh but the appar exasper wasnt funni jeevess superior was stifl from the first wrinkl of his nose to his waft stench of arrog and not onli did it lessen our experi but lower the overal standard of the restaur a true upscal establish ensur the custom comfort at all cost and jeev couldnt even spare a dime

our annoy was overridden by a dine cart bear silver orb of secreci each cover lift and replac in the edibl version of find the queen my fork first tore at symbiot landmark of top grade tuna and avocado wade in ginger soy with it light rejuven effect similar to a fountain of youth for the palat the salad set pose an ordinari look caesar like a diminut wallflow but beneath his classic cover laid a defin bodi and final punch of citrus that lift his status to crowd pleaser caesar

th meat and greet came next with the promis of the protein pack main cours that had led us here my lamb chop encrust with chili crumb were order at medium rare but arriv closer to rare still delect i ravag them dip sporad in the bevi of sauc accompani the meal barnais spici pepper etc the steak au poivr was pave with a thick asphalt of peppercorn not a pothol of nake meat to be seen with a potenc that could remov tar the tear and cough induc by this dish might be use as protect in a dark alley the origin pepper spray 

two of our other carnivor constitu order the porterhous one request medium rare and the other medium a coupl bite into the meal the medium rare requeste found himself in the middl of medium man steak medium man had alreadi manhandl the missteak place befor him cook almost exact like the other and munch happili on what he thought to be his order this was inexcus not onli did these price demand perfect around 50 a steak but the monik of steakhous insist on the chef aptitud for master meat temperatur this was a blunder that couldnt be overlook as easili as jeevess snippi quip and would be the resound memori of the meal though thought of their lumpi heavili salt mash potato would be reminisc of fondly

i could now empath with dr malfi attract to toni soprano i was immedi enamor with this piec of work overthetop and muddl alter ego but inconsist and a mafia size payoff eventu mar my fond feel as prime pucker for it kiss of death in my final farewel i still admir it larger than life charact but couldnt trust prime rep enough to invest that type of doughdo not get the cupcak  they were dri and disgust even the frost was a complet failur  how do you screw up a cupcak this bad  how  

the blend coffe drink were ok and the onli other redeem qualiti of this place is that it open 24 hour  so when it 4 am and your desper for a snack this place is a step up from the vend machinit not realli a coffe shop despit it name it more like a denni becaus they serv a varieti of american food and theyr open 24 hour 

the food itself wasnt veri good 3 of my friend and i share a chicken pot pie which was more like thick chicken noodl soup in a bread bowl cobb salad chicken caesar salad and a quesadilla the salad were okay and the quesadilla was veri averag noth realli memor but it pretti dang overpr i guess that expect as a restaur insid a vega hotel 

servic was super sweet though everyon from the host to the server were realli nice and alway smile but all in all id rather eat at mcdonald than this place to get my servic with a smilewhat a let down maggiano end up to be my first experi end up be a horribl one 

come on now you do not vacuum your carpet when you have guest who are eat make us move to anoth tabl just so you can vacuum doe not make it ani better i think i might have ate some of the dust 

besid that whole ordeal the calamari was the best i ever had here the best i order a chicken dish which was blah kfc prepar better chicken it my fault though order chicken at a italian restaur is like eat sushi at a buffet in vega it suckthis food court rank up there with the food court of airport  

inflat price for mall food court select  poor select  disgruntl employe hate life 

do your shop and go back to the hotel for food  dont wast your time or money here  

place we specif sampled
ichiban meh4 for a small seawe salad  small
philli cheesesteak place noth philli about it
crep place not bad larg serv for about 7
nathan hot dog they serv a better pretzel than serendipi did not like buffet  i still dislik buffet after go to carniv world buffet

thi is suppos the best buffet in las vega okkkkk

accord to my bf this buffet is better than a hometownbut when we left he said the qualiti went down way down

ther are sever area which serv asian mexican etc food

th pho was pretti lame the meat was not even close to what it is suppos to be like and the guy serv me flat noodl yes flat noodl for pho the broth was ridicul mediocr the dim sum was dri around the edg the chines broccoli was too salty

th fri rice was ok the bbq pork was ok i did like the seawe salad which i ad some tofu to

th mexican style rice was good but not authent the cilantro sauc tilapia was the onli  i repeat  onli good thing i ate there that day

th steak my boyfriend ate was not too bad either

th bbq pork rib were cook well but the bbq sauc was just a sweet flavorless sauce

th dessert section was the best thing howev the pie are place on small individu plate it would be better if you could use a spatula and serv as mani slice as you want onto a larg plate  especi sinc they are tini the cherri pie is good but the crust was poor the ice cream was mediocre

i will never go to anoth buffet in my life if i can avoid it if vega buffet are suppos to be so great it frighten me to think of ani other buffet out there

howev i have heard that the more expens buffet at the bellagio are way way better who know it must be said though that those buffet are in a differ class they serv kobe beef for examplmeh your bmw drive cliental doesnt impress me here is the deal when i go out to eat i expect to be treat like a guest not a potenti tip i think this is how it is suppos to be am i right 

either way my fiance had just graduat pharmaci school and was owe a dinner from her wonder father in law tobe and she chose chelsea kitchen when we were seat a server immedi came and took our drink order which was nice after that anoth person came by with the drink and then final our server our server was a late 20 someth that look less than thrill to see our water drink selv 

anyway order the guacamol 10 

not that it was bad or anyth but when we ran out of chip it took five minut for the server to get to our tabl and an addit five min to get the chip not super busi either 

after this it was more of the same i got the short rib which were suppos to be a specialti item now they were not bad but i have had much and made much better and they seem a littl dri 

mi dad and brother got taco that were good but they ran out of tortilla and it took 10 minut to get new ones

th ladi got fri chicken and it was a littl drywith grill broccoli which was not receiv well by the pharmacist anyway my point is thisth server didnt see us as a phat tip and it show via her lack of servic over all food was ok but the server ruin itso im watch diner drivein and dive on the food network and they do a featur on this place  go on and on about the waffl  so the next morn we head over  walk up to the build and peopl everywher just stand around  so i walk in side and was stop by a server and told to step outsid  she hand me a clipboard and walk back in  appar i was suppos to put my own name down on the list to be seat so i did  we wait almost and hour  we were final call to head in  walk in and cant believ how tini this place isthey sit the three of us down at a tabl made for one so were all fight over elbow space  look over the menu and decid to order a waffl egg and oj  server tell me the waffl iron is broken  that was the onli reason i came here becaus of the so call world famous waffl  so i settl for pancak egg and oj  they bring out my teaspoon of oj  serious i have never had such a small glass of oj  the food final arriv and to tell you the truth it was good but not worth the hour of my life i spent stand outsid wait  ill stick to ihopin the movi the 40year old virgin there is a line they repeat often to steve carrel your put the puy on a pedest that your problem

matt big breakfast was on a pedest wed tri to go there a coupl year ago but the crowd outsid was alway too threaten a wait then in august we tri to go but when we ask what the probabl wait time we were told oh we dont realli provid anyon with wait time the line outsid was pretti long and there wasnt realli ani shade and with no potenti end to the wait we came to term with the possibl that wed turn into bacon ourselv sit outsid wait for a tabl 

then this morn i woke up at 630am on a saturday due to insomnia and we said hey there might actual not be a line if we go right now

i just came back from breakfast at matt big breakfast and now im wait for my heart attack

id tri to find out what the big deal was about this greasi spoon so mani time in review and nobodi ever gave a good explan in detail of what make the tradit breakfast food so different

i order the special  which was an egg chees onion and sausag omelett with hash brown sinc it was our first time there we also order a belgian waffl to split

th omelett was more like onion and sausag with a side of egg and chees the sausag was giant slice link enough to feed an armi the amount of onion was not what i expect  it was probabl two entir onion slice up and thrown in there the hash brown are a serv for 4 peopl or someth theyr not slice like ordinari hash brown are slice  theyr ultra skinni slice like angelhair pasta there are a lot of realli crunchi crispi area of angelhair slice hash brown which are tasti thank they are not all salti but what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting

im one year away from have been a vegetarian for 5 year and i was will to go there at this meal becaus i had to see what everyon was rave about and i read on the menu that the meat is natur and grainf not freerang grassf but at least not cornf and hormon and antibioticridden also i eat burger at delux and rokerij and ill eat the prosciutto at bombero so i thought whi not see what the fuss is all about

it was aight not fabul i tri to figur out whi this place is such a big deal to so mani mayb it is shock to some peopl palat to tast food made with real butter and real cream  peopl who ordinarili cook at home and fill their cupboard with the healthi substitut of everi ingredi or mayb typic peopl buy kraft chees or someth i dont know the ingredi were definit real which is i suppos a big deal if you ordinarili eat crap for breakfast or eat at denni it most definit beat moon over my hammi for instance

but we realli miss pallat which realli was the best breakfast downtown

th bread they brought for the toast was delici  but it bread most bread is pretti good the waffl was uber fluffi i had a few bite and said that a tasti plate of diabet right there while i felt my blood sugar go through the roof

most i realli felt a lack in the veget depart 

i might seem like a health nut becaus of this but trust me im not im a tall big person and i eat breakfast at dick hideaway sever time a week it just that at dick hideaway i can have them substitut the potato for veggi usual asparagus and broccoli and substitut the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado im use to have an entir day worth of green at breakfast i suppos meat for me is like dessert ill eat it but it has to be high qualiti and it has to be realli worth it it has to be tremend delici i wont eat meat for meat sake this was probabl somewhat ethic meat but it wasnt an irresist herbi or spici delici sensation

th thickcut bacon that came with the waffl was definit thick and was line with pepper it was good but it was also bacon  bacon should be good it hard to do bad

i see the trendi hipster appeal everywher  orang countertop orang everywher down to the stapler on the counter the 1950s sign that say egg and stuff whatev i get it it better than denni and it better than 5  diner it not the best and it most definit not worth stand around outsid in no shade without ani idea how long the wait will be for a tabl like a sucker

th chalkboard on the wall insid say visit our bar the roosevelt around the corner i hadnt known they own the roosevelt i recommend go to the roosevelt and wait around for a seat there where it worth the wait

im glad i final went to knock the place off it pedest now i just need to wait like a month or someth for my arteri to unclogif you visit trentecinq you may well find yourself ask the question that is pose on the white board in the men room is this restaur half empti or half full ive been to trentecinq twice and both time the restaur was no more than half full that may be due to the fact that belgian food is a novelti in phoenix but i think it also has to do with the valueforyourdollar that this restaur offer four of us had three salad two appet three entre two dessert an ice tea and five glass of wine with tax and tip the tab came to just under 200 it like the menu is in euro instead of us dollar given the current lousi exchang rate the problem is that were dine in phoenix not somewher in belgium factor in the transit locat on 7th street 200 is too much to pay for the meal that we had no wonder there alway plenti of tabl at trentecinq

chef lionel geusken state on his websit i have alway want to cook all of my favorit dish that a laudabl goal but chef lionel need to rememb that his restaur is locat in the valley of the sun and not belgium he need to add some season dish to his boilerpl menu when i first visit in the fall the hearti dish were perfect for the season when i recent had dinner with the bf and two friend at tc in june the menu seem heavi and clunki if the chef insist on keep his hearti menu hed do well to close for the summer and wait for the weather to cool off befor serv his sticktoyourrib fare

i start off with the boulett 10 appet the menu say it a dish of mini meatbal serv in an herb tomato sauc with mix green on the side three meatbal arriv that were as big as tenni ball this dish was a good valu as it could have been an entre if you like eat thee meatbal for your dinner the side salad was a weird accompani and veri much appear as an afterthought the bf order the salad dendiv 9 which featur belgian endiv toss with mix green herb goat chees and candi walnut with a raspberri vinaigrett the portion was larg but the bf said my meatbal were a better choice

for my entre i order the waterzooi 23 this dish was also the entre i order on my first visit to tc it basic a hearti fish soup of salmon halibut shrimp scallop mussel and veget in a saffron cream broth unfortun it was much tastier the first time this time the sauc was fair flat which is a real disappoint given the saffron the bf order what the menu purport to be the nation dish of belgium moul au vin blanc 19 it is a bowl of mussel steam in white wine with leek celeri green onion and fresh herb it was a larg serv of mussel and the bf felt it was a fair deal unlik the french version hes had at other place the broth in this dish was not at all enjoy on it own

for our dine companion one friend order the coquill ostendais 12 appet as his entre i had this dish as my appet on my first visit and it look good this time as well but then again how can you go wrong with scallop bake in a chees bechamel his bf order the steak au poivr 28 the filet mignon was serv with a green peppercorn sauc and fri the steak was petit for the grand 28 price tag

our meal took a real dive in term of valu with dessert the bf and i share the mouss au chocolat 6 as bill on the menu it was a trio of white milk and dark chocol mouss the surpris part was the portion size given that this dessert is basic chocol pud it was a bit surpris for it to arriv in what was essenti a doubl shot glass it was good but not 6 good our friend decid to share the tropezienn 8 the menu claim that this dessert is french brioch pastri fill with creami vanilla custard ill allow for some hyperbol in menu write but this dessert was anyth but french pastri fill with custard it was realli a slice of flat vanilla cake that had been cut in half and fill with what tast like vanilla pud iron our friend who order this dish is a pastri chef and it goe without say that he was not impress with this dessert

if onli the decor was as fun and invit as the restaur websit would lead you to believ this place either ascrib to a minimalist aesthet or there wasnt budget to make the space interest it has a lower midrang european hotel feel

th servic was attent  howev that wasnt enough to offset the overpr menu

it is interest to have a belgian restaur in phoenix if onli chef lionel would alter his menu to reflect the season and discount his price so that they appear to be in us dollar rather than in euro then trentecinq would be good to go hope these chang will occur befor tc shutter it door for goodonli reason to be here if you realli want one
 you have the 24 hr buffet passand are a crave fruit or b want to drink until you drop on bottomless cheap beer coorsmil light or hous wine ask for a price of 10without hit the casinoclubspubs711

a for all else
 the food is subparand as expect ie clam  mussel areugh a disast prime rib is at it rubber primeand the new york stripi as hard as the new york brick that make up wall street mexican food section look and tast like it was rummag out of a trashcan  seriously
 cant say much about servic when your a platinumdiamond holder but by observ other tablesthey are pretti nice
 oh yeah while normal guest have the cold crab leg platinumdiamond section get steam crab leg which imho are a lot better

ambiance
 lot and lot and lot of elder peopl id say that a good thing if the food was great becaus the line to ani great item would be shortbut as mention earlier the food is pretti much subparthey have mash potato exclaim a child to his grandpar as if it were christma morn  i couldnt help but laugh  just a coupl of minut befor that my wife and i had our photo taken with a 5 foot spoon and fork that the resid buffet photograph then tri to sell to us for 25 dure dinner 

i had a coupl of comp for the buffet of buffet that were about to expir  even though we pretti much onli do buffet when friend and famili visit we could not let these babi expir without use them  the line for pari and planet hollywood buffet were over an hour long when i call so we end up here  no line  no surpris  

we were last here 5 year ago and not much has chang  the most signific thing was that they got rid of their chocol fountain and now give out bag of cotton candi  the best thing were the crab leg which were larger and tastier than the one at the rio we had a day later  i also like the carv station and the dessert area so we main just fill up on those  the salad mexican and asian station were all mix bag  i heard the mash potato were great

a famili of 5 sit next to us were alreadi on dessert and as we were about to leav the father got up to speak to the manag to complain about the pasta be cold  he said it ruin their dinner so the manag fulli refund them  they were alreadi on dessert  so for cheapo look to take a shot i guess you have a mark herein the interest of full disclosur i have to say that i use to come here all the time when it was ye old sandwich shopp the servic was fun and fast the hous was virtual untouch from the 1920s down to the extent of the old tv set and the creaki wood floor and they had absolut the best soup in town

wel they lost their leas and then this ladi lisa g move in next think you know the fabul funki 1920s bungalow has had it heart rip out in favor of modern decor yecchso i realli have to ask ms g whi didnt you go find some new dig if you want modern decor i hate it when peopl rip out the fabul old wood floor and plaster and put in drywal 

that saidth food is good kind of modern fusion ive onli been there twice for lunch so i cant say how dinner is and sinc ive onli been there for lunch i cant say if the wine list is ani good perhap ill be back for dinnerif hubbi and i can take see what been done to one of our favorit lunch hangout that is

and the soup sorri id rather go back to ye old sandwich shopp in it dreari industri set over at 31st ave and thoma and get their fabul soup not there anyth wrong with lisa gs soup but the sandwich shopp ladi have everybodi beat

sofood rate a 35 ambianc a 15 for tear out the funki of yet anoth one of our dwindl number of histor home 

but all you yuppi urban type out there are gonna be happi camper so go have a great timei went for the sunday champagn  the champagn itself was just oktheyr not gonna give u the good stuff 4 buffet anyway we end up make mimosa with the champagn  oj  they take your drink order upfront  the cashier 1st  then the waiterwaitress bring your drink 4 u afterward when your seatedweird but that how they do itth waiter here seem to be veri unorganizedw kept get approach by sever differ waiter ask us the same questiondont they know have assign section as to whos wait who crazy

i do not know whi everyon is rave about the crab leg heretheyr all so skinni with absolut no meat insidenot worth work on it look like peopl had been pick through them alreadyyuckk  this is definit not the place 2go 2 for crab leg if you realli like crab leg go to bellagio  rio buffetthey have an awesom select of seafoods

th dessert sectionbar was extrem lackingi was expect more of a varieti due to the french theme that they were go for here the onli thing that was actual good for dessert was the creme brule which was way too smallth ice cream machin was broken so that sucked
th crepe were good but i wish that they had more top fruit to choos from to put into on them 

i know that they receiv sever award sever year earlier but it funni how they havent gotten ani recent i wonder whi hmmmayb cuz the servic  the qualiti of food has gone downhil perhap yupp that must be it im def not gonna come backid rather go to bellagio  rio buffetway more worth itthat a bil ole whoppin wtf for lunch 

ive been to villag for all 3 meal befor and lunch is definit the worst dinner is averag and breakfast is the best 

but lunch this time around was so pathet the select are realli heavi on the meat veal roast beef which is dri and ined pork chicken sausag everyth id normal love a meatcentr meal if it were actual good but the qualiti of the meat was just horribl and it not like it had been sit out for a few hour  we got to lunch just as they were switch over from breakfast meat and bread what kind of peasant meal is this though id probabl have difficulti lay out a strong select for lunch what are you suppos to serv anyway sandwich lunch should be dinner but lighter and with egg 

the dessert were also pretti lame i was excit they had french macaron but the creme brule was more flan than creme boo the one thing i can say is that the coffe was good and unlimit 

im not like their fluoresc blue light in the main room  if you can get seat in the tini dine room off to the side with warm light and french accent warm light is import to a healthi appetite

go for the breakfast onliin the past pari had one of the best buffet befor wynn open then pari decid to join other resortsthi was where everyth fell apart 

i would have given them about four star when i was younger but onc buffet of buffet string alongthey deserv two star the qualiti of food definit dwindl down

first off servic here was excel as alway yes our waitress might not refil our appl juic veri quick but i cant blame her for all the tabl she had to deal with im a reason person 

second i went dure breakfasti onli enjoy eat the build your own omelet and crepe station they rush you so the crepe is a bit soggynot like bacchan buffetpati the crab leg didnt tast that good eithernot fresh the carv station onli had prime rib ham and sausagehowev there was no one to slice the meatso everyth becam dri the dish that they display didnt look veri appetizingso i didnt even tri it didnt want to get sick

last i am sad to say that i wouldnt suggest come here for breakfast i havent came here for awhil for dinner but if i doill updat thishowev it may be awhileim addict to bacchan buffet now 

note unlimit beer mimosa and wine for 1299if it wasnt for the le crepe with nutella banana and hazelnut this place would warrant a 1star rate  

over the mani year of have so mani peopl talk about vega buffet be the best i had to tri at least onc while i was there i had so mani expect but mayb that the problem here 

first off we were seat almost a block away from the actual food station this place realli make you work for the food the food is section off into sever station base on the cours appet main and dessert i alway go for the seafood and meatsyou figur you get your money worth that way serious who want to get full on cheap salads

i got a littl bit of everyth im a dabbler the meat were salti and dri the seafood was just okay i didnt even touch the salad but their coffe was good overal i felt there wasnt much love put into the food it was all about quantiti versus qualiti while id much prefer the latter there is someth about buffet that make peopl pile on everyth even the food is aw i am guilti of this but i end up not eat 80 of what i had on my plate

a my even was not turn out as expect i decid to tri their crepe station per recommend from my friend i got their nutella banana and hazelnut i have to say that dish made up for everyth els i had befor there it was fresh made infront of me so how can anyon mess that up 

now that all the glitz and glamour is goneit would take a lot for me to come back to this place againwhen arriv to vega i was get over be sick with the flu i was still a littl bit sick but that wasnt go to hold me down so we wait in this massiv line which the server said would take about an hour to mayb two hour long 

while wait and wait about an hour and half we got to sit on a tabl i knew what i alreadi want and what i order was edamam for everyon to share and a porridg with centuri egg in it and a littl bit of pork the edamam had a lot of salt on it and that was kind of a turn off the porridg was alright but of cours im not go to say it was amaz 

overal the food was alright and the 7 peopl i was with enjoy it as well servic wasnt that great though so dont expect much from the server they arent go to refil anyth for you until you wave your hand up and downto paraphras the late great clara peller where the lobster
i am refer to the absenc of edibl lobster in the lobster mac  chees 14 that i order as part of our 150 meal for two there were exact 4 tini piec of cartilag from the clawpoint of the lobster i alway discard this part when i eat lobster and it seem that they throw that crap in there to trick custom into think there actual lobster in the dish even more madden is flip through the channel in our room upstair and stop on mlife tv to watch hubert keller himself describ the most comfort american food be his signatur lobster mac  chees  he then chop up an entir lobster tail and toss it in his mac  chees skillet

th onion soup 6 was odd thick and tast realli badforyou like it was made with lot of butter the crab  avocado sphere 9 was pretti good but it would be pretti hard to mess that up chill jumbo lump crab and avocado slice 

the branzino 29 fish was about a 5ounc portion and sat atop an ined mound of salti and sour risotto barley with some random chorizo sauc that made it wors the kushi oyster 9 were much smaller than the awesom one we got at sensi a week earlier and the shucker at fleur get an f for leav bit of top shell shave in with the oyster ruin two of the oysters

if you must go to fleur do not sit on the patio like we did the duel piano bar entertain 50 yard away is realli hard on the ear in more way than one we endur a 7minut version of barbi world and the electr piano they use sound like 100 decibel cell phone rington the water fountain around the corner onli add to the chaos

anyway peopl seem to love this restaur but i dont get it i would be total down with 5070 per person at a tapasstyl place if the food was good unfortun it isnt i can honest say i wouldnt eat at fleur again even if it were freefirst off im not one of those two star review you know the kind it cost so much i dont get the food i like hamburg this place is too fanci so here your one star that not me i am a foodi check my other review for proof so given this disclaim here my two cent on latlier

on word 
halfassed

pregame
our group of nine ate here this last weekend i made reserv in advanc they requir a 75 reserv fee nonrefund and not appli to the meal  that a first and becaus we were a larg group we were limit to tast menus onli fine aint no thing  this place is 2 on yelp im excit i love food

th experience
w were smash into the wall there was not enough room to get into our seat onc the tabl was move so all the ladi in their love dress could shimmi in they were trap  the whole meal  full bladder and all the servic suck they alreadi had their guarante 20 gratuiti becaus of our parti size so we endur a meal full of empti glass miss silverwar and a wonki table

th food
averag we had two vegetarian with us the restaur knew about this ahead of time and when the amus arriv they were serv foie gras mous you cant take the time to whip them up a gazpacho shooter two of the cours in a row had the same pesto sauc not a big deal but the primari compon were so bland all you could tast was pesto sir for your fist and second cours this even you will be have pesto comeon most of the dish were one note in general the meal was uninspir 

in summary
w left disappoint michelin should revok their one star i know it harsh but it truth do you hear me bibendumive struggl for a bit with how to rate this restaur  base on all the spectacular review on yelp as well as the exorbit price and the reput of the great joel robuchon i was quit disappoint with my dinner here on monday januari 14

neither my boyfriend and i have ever been here so we tri the menu b which allow you to choos one out of the five follow cours httpmgmgrandcompdfatelierprefixmenupdf at 10500 and the featur season menu with the quail httpmgmgrandcompdfatelierdecouvertemenupdf  the one shown is differ from what is offer now at 15900

the season menu is 4 star on tast though my boyfriend felt the price is a littl on the expens side for what we got  we both had the same amus bouch which was a foie gras with a parmesan foam  the foam gave the right amount of light to the foie gras which ive alway found to be veri rich  anoth standout is the scallop with chive oil and a bit of garnish  the quail was also awesom  pretti much everi cours was veri good but the dessert were quit ordinari though definit abov average

i with my menu b was not so lucki  i think the issu i have is this restaur obsess with put a lot of bell and whistl  on someth that should be simplier  for exampl i had the hamachi which came with a delici yellowtail atop a mountain of avocado diplik thing and some mint  neither the avocado nor mint enhanc the yellowtail which was the star of the dish but rather obscur it with their weird flavors

th lobster bisqu was also veri odd and not flavor at all  there were thin piec of asparagus but what i had an issu with was the broth was not savori but odd salti foami without depth  robuchoun will be spit on my pictur when i say this but ive had trader joe bisqu from a box which was more delect  

for the fish i had a chilean sea bass which was nice cook but again it tast was obliter and enhanc by some weird herb  the star of menu b was the hanger steak which was perfect done with a love carmel shallot on top  i had it medium rare  the dessert of panna cotta with corn ice cream had a few piec of carmel popcorn thrown into it which gave the dessert which wouldv otherwis been veri smooth an odd crunchi and weird textureflavor

th cocktail  gin martini and the pomm brune  were delici but they mustv come from the bowel of the mgm as our amus bouch came befor the cocktail  at least 10 minut had elaps  when i made a comment to the server suppos the bartend himself that we were starv for alcohol there was no reaction  in fact the waitstaff all dress in black act as if we were dine in an er where one should be quiet and reserv  the servic seem odd joyless as my food  all of the staff were profession especi our counter server  we werent look for are you done with that dessert hon  you want more water sweeti type of servic but the staff seem a littl on the cool side  anoth yelper had comment that the kitchen staff work never spoke to each other they do but now i can understand what she was refer to  

the highlight of the even was the bread which was deliciousand they give you unlimit breadwhich we took with wanton abandon  i suppos the sous chef a frenchman came around and gave us more mash potato  which is more like melt butter with a bit of potato thrown in  that plus the bread and the slowmov cocktail were what made the even for me  

mi boyfriend who did not pay for the meal is more up in arm about the entir experi than i am  he ask for 3 basket of bread till i threaten to break up with him  we do not feel that the high price were justifi  on the other hand a coupl next to us  a french coupl  drove all the way from scottsdal to the restaur for the meal  of cours they order a la cart and their food look and smell delici  unfortun at the high price tag ill not be go back to tri the restaur anytim soonahhhhh we are sit at the restaur right now wait wait wait for the next cours to arriv this has potenti been the worst custom servic i have ever receiv at a restaur and as a result both my husband and i are play on our phone to avoid eye contact with our server 

we had a 730 reserv and upon tri to check in the immatur unprofession hostess told us we would still have to wait 20 minut ok no biggi  hubbi and i went to wander around the age casino that is the mgm we came back 25 minut later onli to be told that we would still have to wait 20 minut more serious we are pay  yes that mani dollar sign for dinner and you cant even friggin seat us on time we have been to multipl michelin star place and we were quit frank appal 

mi husband threw a littl fit about this and after a littl scene out unprofession hostess told us we could wait next door at the veri exclus joel robuchon loung oh goodi a place to sit at an overpr bar with no comp drink becaus you are bad at honor reservations

w order drink and 5 second of receiv them the hostess came over to tell us our tabl was readi then she told us we had to close out at joel robuchon and that we could not bring our drink over next door as it is a separ establish what is this cheesecak factori actual scrap that  even they let you bring drink from the bar to the tabl 

then we came over the bitchi hostess also slam everi door on the way and show her anger at her own ineptitud 

food was great not gonna lie but then my husband ask to speak to the manag  and thing went downhil  again wait isnt this a michelin star restaurant

turn out they dont current have a manag the sommeli came over he defend the front staff did not acknowledg that they were unprofession and then said well what do you want me to do

anyway this place suck avoid at all cost and spend your money and time elsewher in the time it took me to write this epic novel of a review we have still been wait for our next cours 

ahhhhh i want to like you sad it been 8 month sinc ive been to lucill and the great custom experi i experienc my first trip appear to be a thing of the past

i was expect to wait 30 to 40 minut so have to wait 55 minut wasnt realli an issu for me howev it did allow me to wit an employe pick cigarett butt out of an ashtray with his bare hands

im sure he wash hand when he went insid but he had to open the door with his bare hand and god know what els he touch between the door and the faucet

onc we were final seat our server disappear for 15 minut and i had to flag down someon differ in order to place a drink order

when our server final arriv we place an order for an appet it was deliv by a third person who threw the plate on our tabl and it slid across almost to the wall she announc fri green tomato and walk away

no silverwar no napkin so i got up and hunt down our server ask for some to be brought over so we could eat our tomato  was told sorri we ran out how doe a proper manag restaur run out of silverwar it doesnt the server sent someon over with some silverwar but it was given to the booth behind us who didnt have ani food on their tabl 

so we have been there more than an hour an a half didnt have silverwar and we didnt have drinks

onc our silverwar arriv the tomato were a littl bland but the sauc made up for the lack of flavor in them 

when we final got around to place an order i ask for an extra corn bread muffin and a side of mac and chees these are both on the of side order menu and  should not have been too difficult but i had to ask twice for them to get deliv so i could eat them with my meal

th manag did come over and apolog for our experi and offer to take some of the item off our bill but when the bill arriv everyth was still on it

i consid call him over and point that out but figur it would be easier just to pay for everyth and call it a night

it may just be anoth 8 month till i come back for that delici blacken catfish but i will be back eventu onc the memori of last night fade awayi have to sayiv tri  tri to like tammi coe cake  just cant do it  i love to support local folk in their endeavor but the cake we had from here was just gross in my opinion  my mom got one of her cake for my bachelorett parti  the cake tast veri funki insid like it had been frozen  thaw out one too mani time  gotten that weird freezerfridg flavor  kinda dri insid  the fondant was gooey thick  tast like past or mayb playdoh with some sugar thrown in  no thanksw all felt the same as after we had our initi sliver of cake the rest went uneaten veri strang for a cake to go uneaten in my circl  sinc then ive tri her cooki which also lack in flavor consist etc  aj has better cooki  cakesil stick to them thank you veri muchim not go back to tammi coe for a while  realli 

mi cowork and i have been make a habit of grab lunch from tammi coe it so close to our offic and weve been enjoy the sandwich of the day and an amaz cooki we were on a onc a week basi with tammi coe 

im done  for now 

weve had back to back bad experi at tammi coe late horribl servic what happen 

mi favorit convers from our last visit

m after wait near 20 minut for my sandwich did you put my soup in there

clerk um  look around and see soup on counter no here it is  but do you want me to put it in someth els in a drink carrier

m puzzl look

clerk if i just put it in the bag it will spill all over

m then yes pleas put it in a carrier intern no i want my hot soup spill all over after i wait 20 minut for a cold sandwich toss it in the bag whi dontcha

th food is still veri good it just not cheap and i dont mind pay a bit extra for good food and good servic the staff there is in slow motion or someth latethe front entranc at padr modern mexican is realli one of the most uniqu and invit entranc ive experienc in phoenix the use of glass and wood are truli love 

that said padr appeal to the lowest common denomin of the hip hop crowd that patron this restaur on sunday afternoon with a 5 cover one would think there would be more of a draw than good music and a period tight crowd unfortun the music is where it begin and end with padr 

some year ago we ate at padr and found the food to be quit good i dont know what happen in the interim for a restaur that is first and foremost a place to get food and also serv alcohol to be serv their foodstuff on paper plate is disastr yeah i understand that youll be save a lot of water not have to wash all those plate but that someth i expect at a bar that serv food as an afterthoughtnot the other way around and if a restaur has a waitstaff one can reason expect an amic staff with at least an iota of attent toward their clientel nope not here i do understand that the younger crowd wasnt rais to appreci waitstaff and probabl dont tip so i kind of understand whi youd rather tri to get in some girl pant than take three consecut order perhap you dear server are better suit to work in an environ that doesnt requir such distract as do one job and one might mistaken presum that a restaur would put it reput on the line with the food that is serv not the case at padr whose view of modern is fast at the expens of flavor dont serv me rancid chees on a stale tortilla and expect me to not be tick off i realli dont give a hoot that it onli cost 295 the cover should help absorb the phenomen cost of serv edibl food dont even get me start on a mexican restaur run out of pacifico realli that like ani number of bar in the valley run out of bud light i wont toler it there and i certain wont accept that here 

the next time i want to hear good hip hop music feel crowd in my seat and eat subpar mexican food ill strap on my walkman tune it to 983 hop on my bike and ride it through the drive through at taco bell becaus this trip suck it suck 

 one star becaus my mother taught me if i dont have someth nice to say dont say anyth at all anoth star for the good music and companithis place fail on so mani level first off 5 cash cover to get past the door onli to find yourself want to bail in less than 60 second the music was be play at a ridicul level tough to hear your self think let alon carri a convers with member of your dinner parti the servic was atroci and our server win thumb down for be the worst in the 602 our drink order were delay and stagger leav some with empti for far too long and they ran out of pacifico major fail our food was lacklust at best we had the chees crisp and carn asada taco the food was cheap and it was evid in the tast and present paper plate serious was this a restaurantbar turn cheesi hiphop club or vice versa it difficult to eat a meal and enjoy the compani of friend with peopl crowd all around you the place lack flow and swagger in major way meh ive experi betteri person will never eat there again

th chip are actual amaz though i would eat those a lot if it didnt requir me stpping foot in the ultim broslut restaurant


th food is gross the tortilla are ok i like the decor actual but the employe are slutti and by slutti i saw skirt soo short if they pick someth off the floor you for sure would see vagina

appar the uniform is jean skirt and heels

thi is the male glitteri shirt wear capitol of scottsdal the food suck dont eat herei actual did not enjoy anyth about the food that we got from here

th fact that regardless of the place regardless of the 14 oz of meant 1495 for a roast beef sandwich is beyond ridiculous

and what doe it come with meat and bread

but wait that not all

for onli 150 extra you can get a slice of cheese

and for 1 extra you can have lettuc and tomato

wtf

i love roast beef sandwich absolut love them i was not awar it was possibl to make a bad roast beef sandwich

thi was definit the worst sandwich i have ever had in ani variety

first of all the roast beef did not tast like anyth it was bizarr it tast like water

and the issu with vega is the concept of less is more is out the window

w had to complet deconstruct the sandwich befor we could even take a bite there was near a pound of roast beef roll into a huge roll and slap on these squirr piec of bread 

not to mention there was a half a pound of iceberg lettuc and white onion what deli doesnt offer red onion

it was such a disappoint especi sinc the bf had realli want a pastrami sandwich which is also never bad which i veto becaus i had a queasi belli and want someth with a littl less flavor not someth with no flavor

it was just an absolut failur depress and a failur i can onli assum that the aw and douchebaggeri of the chris angel show is rub off on this place like an airborn virus or someth 

aw a fifteen dollar burger that just wasnt tasti i thought that bacon onion cheddar and bbq sauc would automat make this thing great not so the fri were mushi the pickl was good though the partner in crime like her panini but sinc shes not write this her opinion doesnt count 

douchebaggeri walk in and tell the hostess we want a to go order she say that what the server are for and to grab a seat whatev 15 min later our order get taken anoth 15 min later and we have our food thank god for those big stupid plastic drink thingi to keep me compani 30 minut and 35 later i am total underwhelm 

disclaim i did not see the chris angel show howev when it ran on tlc it was full of aw and douchebaggeri so i just assumlet get the bore bad  stuff out of the way so i can talk about the fun part

overpriced
not delicious
you have two peopl wait on you but it alway slow
bad water serious not even a lemon can mask the disgust flavor of their water
it alway cold

honest if this restaur wasnt high up and spin i would never go here

i took my niec ice skate at citi scape so i figur this would be a fun place to have an over price dinner sinc we were right up the street when in romeor something

i order some curri chicken thing and my niec had grill chees off the kid menu  we also order a molten cake for dessert but there was no molten whatev no need to to hash it becaus i knew go in the food sorta suck 

our bill was 70 but we serious had a blast the whole dinner was fill with gasp and excit and sheer thrill about how fun this restaur wasi have to say im rather disappoint after my half hour  trek to chandler onli to be serv cold chines food in a cavern and empti retail locat  id read all the rave review about jade red chicken and was amp for some kick ass grub  three differ peopl i know person  all told me i need to check out cb as well and one of my bud whose culinari curios is on par with mine say he liter crave this stuff

i was pretti stoke to tri someth new tonit for dinner as we tend to get bog down in central phoenix and eat at the same place over  over again  it friday nite id had a few beer after work and had  a pretti light lunch so i was beyond peckish and downright readi for the tast sensat i expect chino bandido to be  my better half and i drove from cenpho down to the cultur devoid center of the univers aka chandler hungri and excit  wed read the review use the interact menu tool on the cb websit and we were pump for an excel if not quirki ding experi  not  

the restaur itself is in a bizarr gravelli strip mall odd wedg between a nail salon and a store call simpli wide shoe  we walk in to what felt like a vacant student union dure spring break  when everyon els is in ft lauderdal rocki point or the caribbean and your the onli kid broke enough to stay on campus and work at your librari job  there were mayb 2530 other diner in the place but it is so huge insid that it felt empti and barren

w were greet by a niceenough counter ladi who took our order and punch them into the regist  i felt somewhat rob of the papermenu order experi id heard so much about  no challeng noth uniqu   we grab our drink utensil and straw and settl in at the end of a loooong vacant  rubbermaid fold tabl jason ask whi they had church buffet tabl set up  i thought mayb there was someth cool about thembut nopejust cheap tabl  we look around a bit while we wait for our food to come over and rais our eyebrow question at one anoth i kept wait to get it  which i figur we would when the food arrived

ther were some scream kid run around while their parent ignor them chat with one anoth and text  brat brat brat  get outta my yard  i yell insid my head like that mean old ladi from down the block when i was a kid 

mi annoy with bad parent asid i couldnt figur out whi everyon love this place it has all the ambianc of a medclin i felt like at ani minut a middleag woman in chilipepperembellish scrub would shuffl over hand me a clipboard with a flowershap pen ask me to sign a releas form and pay my copay  there wasnt even muzak play  there was no music play which made the place seem even more devoid of life

th food soon arriv and we dug in eager everyth was a smidg abov room temp  if that and pretti bore to be frank the jade red chicken is pretti compar to panda express orang chicken  the bbqd pork didnt seem to have ani asian bbq flavor  more like roast pork soak in sugar and the cold thick refri bean could have come from taco bell or a can noth unordinari or even interest here the onli thing that was in the least bit interest was the pork fri rice which tast odd like itd been cook with cheap white sherri and shallot  which ive not experienc befor with fri rice that was atyp but certain not interest or enchant  the onli redeem thing about the meal was the snickerdoodl which seem odd out of place for either mexican or asian food  it was pretti good though

even though i was physic full after the meal i felt veri emot empti odd depress about chandler it environ and it resid  everyon els in the joint seem odd devoid of emot as  certainloy not like peopl who go out to dinner on a friday even  

im think we should have aim the car toward the origin chino bandido in the ave  i am  a fan of asian and latin food and admit have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffet  so im usual pretti toler of cheap bad fri food  im think that the origin divey joint didnt translat well to chandler so im will to give cb anoth tri  just never again in the east valley 

pleas someon explain to me what im miss hereafter watch guy fieri on diner drivein and dive review of chino bandido i decid to give it a tri on the show the owner said you can make someth like  20 thousand differ combin wow sound great right 
to begin this multicultur journey i decid to look at their menu onlin where they have a tutori to learn how to order easi enough as i spout out my order can i get a combin 8 9b jfr blk i realiz i had no clue what i was about to get myself into  

the combin of all of the flavor was just odd i realli realli want to like it but in the end it was just a heap of oddtast food that just didnt work i will give it to them for do someth new but be forewarn the jerk chicken will light your face on firewe no longer buy our meat from this place becaus the qualiti of servic and product has been go down and down over the last year or so after have to throw away the ground beef for the second time we final made the switch to imart for all our meat relat purchas when we would ask for extra lean ground beef we would have to pay an astronom high price and it was still not extra lean it was full of fat and seem like they were mix in lamb with it too becaus it stank like hell 

i was get tire of be bad treat by the butcher who conveni went deaf when we would ask for someth not in arab but would be complet on their toe help whoever spoke in arab exclus with them one time when i ask for a woman to repeat herself behind the counter she liter stare and me for a few second and move over and start help someon els i guess we are not good enough for them to help over there 

we still like the alhana restaur and they do offer some good spice that we will go in and purchas but we will no longer be use their meat counterparadis lost cafe would be more appropri  i did not see adam or eve and i most certain did not find a muse and i wouldnt go so far as to say that beelzebub work in the kitchen but it just wasnt that good  ok all those refer may be lost on anyon that hasnt pore through john milton book or at least the cliff note but there it is like a broken marin mammal sad mar a beauti beach

skip it  even for late night munchi it didnt fill the bill  chicken finger like overgrown kid meal nuggi  blahso i live in brazil for a coupl year and up until come here had never been to a subpar brazilian restaur  the onli other place i had been in this area was fogo de chao  which was pricey but incred  

i imagin go to this place for lunch would be okay  it look like you could get out of there for around 15 for lunch  but for two dinner two can of guarana brazilian soda and tip it was well over 100  let me say that the qualiti of food  servic would have been more reason in the 40 range

th chees bread pao de quejo was amaz  but it imposs to screw that up  the salad bar was wors than sizzler  i couldnt believ that rice  bean werent avail in the salad bar area and all of the prepar salad look like they were scoop out of a prepackag bin

th grill pineappl was good and the picanha sirloin was decent  but overal the meat select was poor and mani of the piec were dri and overcook  i guess when you spend 100 for a night out with the wife you expect great servic  to leav satisfi  it just didnt happen hereid been want to tri ticoz sinc it open there was so much buzz surround it for a coupl month after it open and some of my gay friend still rave about it so i final tri it on saturday for lunch and was a littl dissapointed

first off i dont care if you are gay that is absolut your choic and i respect you make choic for yourself but pleas for the love of god hire one person that still talk like he has a pair of testicl everi waiter bartend and host that we encount was almost inaud and spoke in such a high tone of voic that i actual thought i was speak to women

second be the onli tabl in the bar 1 tabl in the patio area should mean that we get decent servic watch 4 staff member stand in a close proxim circl behind the bar talk about how much they drank last night and forget to bring us more drink a bill my credit card back after i paid the bill etc is a littl disconcert perhap even more disconcert than my lack of abil to spell or my run on sentenc 

final when i tell you that i think your pork chile verd dish has an almost ined salt content and you repli back to me ive been tell them that for a long time and they wont chang it it obvious that someth is go wrong in your line of communic you wouldnt tell me that if a you didnt also feel that way or b youv heard other custom say the same thing regardless what you should have said is well i appreci the feedback sir may i offer you anoth dish with a lower salt content and ill be sure to let the chef know what you thought as well

th atmospher was cool but not near up to fez or switch level it obvoius that i am in the minor but this restaur realli didnt score mani point in my booki feel like ive been all over with my review for this place but dont worri this may be the last updat my last experi at ticoz was aw it seem like as soon as lola tapa close everyth went complet downhil the happi hour went way up use to be 2 sangria on tuesday now 350 they hire a new staff servic becam crap dure busi hour they alter their menu to cheapen it up  like kat s said there use to be 3 salsa that came with fresh fri chipsnow there is one crappi salsa that last time i visit came with cold stale chip  and to top thing off their sangria lack the great in flavor and qualiti that i onc saw in them

it realli suck to regular go somewher and watch it crumbl ticoz initi tick me off but then won me over for the longest time i recommend peopl go there and have a great experi and sangria but like ani roller coaster relationship the high and low are begin to take their toll on me and i know i need to just let go i may wind up at ticoz if a friend of mine want to go but i wont be lead the pack there anytim soon sadfacwhoa  what happen to ticoz this place use to be awesom  

as i wait for an etern to get a drink i look around the place and it look like it was in desper need of some tlc  furnitur and carpet need to be clean wall need to be repaint  the plant were all dead in the women restroom  this place is die a slow death  what use to be a happen place for happi hour was dead it was sad hour  

the servic was terribl  we were sit in an empti bar and it still took a while to get a drink  my friend and i were go to order app but they never came back to ask us if we want food thank god too becaus we would have had to stay there longer  we chug our drink and bounc outsorri to say but there much better cupcak bakeri here in vegas

thi was probabl my third time buy cupcak from the cupcakeri at differ locat be a chain i probabl shouldnt have tri to the 2nd or 3rd time but it was close to where we had finish lunch

w order a varieti the red velvet southern bell the strawberri lemonad the chocol passion and the grasshopp 

tast  not great
servic  ehh
select  i guess they do have some good choic but noth veri unique

tri the cupcak from lil brown sugar or cake fluffier lighter more creativ tastier just my opinionhalloween vega review  part 1
need food where

wher doe on eat when they dont want to leav the signatur tower they are stay at yet still want option whi the mgm grand buffet erm of cours unfortun the buffet is at the other end of the casino and if you thought the walk from mgm room to the pool was long walk to the buffet is even longer hell you could probabl work up an appetit go here imagin if you didnt know your way and was look for it that could take day 

we didnt know where it was 

and by the time we got there the food was readi and wait and edibl after a long weekend of stuff edibl is doabl twss lmao as with everyth els in the vega the dig are either alright to lavish decad this place was alright staff was cool and as for the eats

let see i had for 25  
eggs
bacon
fil tater tot thing
bacon
deep fri shrimp
toast
omelette
bacon
juice
coffee
water
bacon 
and bacon to go with my bacon

and yes you can have too much bacon
blehmeh ive experienc better is right

i went twice for breakfast due to convienc  howev i dont advis anyon to go here unless they are stay at mgm like i was with money to blow like i had  i find lgo to be a bit of a jekyl and hyde type of place so i will give a review with equal part dualiti in the end though im go to go against the overwhelm posit grain and give it two star for reason below 

the food

mr hyde say  this place seem to be two differ type of restaur there the breakfastbrunch serv and then there the altern menu which consist of salad and their eponym pizza for what it worth ive been here mani time more than i care to but my girlfriend use to live within walk distanc so it was too conveni to counter with ani convinc argument against go of the mani visit for breakfast ive just felt underwhelm by the food the egg dish crepe etc alway leav me feel unsatisfi and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor depart for what it worth theyr go for a french flare to the cuisin but it still alway seem to under deliv 

dr jekyl say  on the contrari the nonbreakfast food are quit good the salad and the pizza are realli good fresh made and what you would expect from an artisan pizza place addit they have a solid beer and wine list 

the brick and mortar

mr hyde say  this place specif dure the breakfast hour is a disast and would make ani retail oper manag cring at the lack of flow befor them you line up at one station to order food and pay you line up at anoth station to order coffe and pay there no tabl servic you have to order your food all the while scout for the random tabl open while also keep a watch eye out for your food to make sure you claim it befor it goe cold and to top it off this entir place also oper as what most peopl think is a realli cute market full of curio that other peopl call junk mr hyde believ that this market onli add to the utter chao and lack of flow for the restaur it would be differ if it was off to the side but smack in the middl of everyth yield chao 

dr jekyl say  avoid breakfast and go for dinner where you can have great salad pizza and actual be seat at a tabl by a hostess and serv by a waiter what a revel the dinner area is actual in a differ room and you can avoid the realli cute market

th get there

mr hyde say  the park or rather lack there of is a huge negat there is minim park on premis minim park across the street with most of the neighbor busi post sign threaten to tow you 

dr jekyl say  let call this place what it is  a nice neighborhood restaur that can prove conveni if you live nearbi and can walk avoid the hassl and frustrat that await you when you have to drive there 

summary
in the end it realli four star for the pizza two for the breakfast food but they get ding an extra star for the headach that is park 

mani phoenician love this place i we think you can do better elsewher 

author note my girlfriend has now move from this neighborhood so ani argument in her favor for a visit base on proxim is now moot mr hyde has crack a menac smilewow it seem like taco bell in arizona has a full beer wine and liquor licensthis review is for the bar onli  my bf and i went here on a saturday night  it was rather slow with two bartenders

drink were good but the servic was lacklust  the bartend werent attentwe were on our way to the cosmo pool for lord and want a quick small meal so we decid to give their happi hour a try

i arriv first befor my friend and when i approach the hostess stand i was greet by a veri bitchi hostess i told her there were two more peopl come and we were there for happi hour so she lead me to the bar area and give me one menu not even the happi hour menu and prompt leav i sat for a good 10 minut befor someon even came over the place was dead my friend arriv and someon final make it around we place our order i went with salmon tartar and steam broccoli with calamansi soy the salmon was so salti it wasnt edibl i end up eat the taro chip it came with and the broccoli was all dri out for 2 item and 2 drink my bill with tip was 40 sorri social hous this is not so happi hour wont be come backnot sure if we went on a realli off night but i was extrem disappoint with tvs  as andrea wrote below damn her for write her review befor me our bill came to 90 for dinner and it was 90 too much

th waiter tyler i think said that their version of pad thai with halibut was his favorit dish on the menu favorit dish  realli  it was pretti bland  noth special at all  we also went with the macadamia crust mahi mahi  not so much  pretti bland as well  the steam asparagus was fine but how can you realli screw that up  i had a spoon or two of jare wonton soup  that was actual decent but not enough to bring me back

sorri tvs  i wont be see you again anytim soon but good luck to youi had some visitor from corpor in town  one for our annual oper inspect one to have a look at some of the tactic market were develop in my region  anyway they want to eat here so

her we were at trader vic  the atmospher is nice island theme opul and textur pleas  we were greet veri warm and sat in the bar for cocktail and a snack befor dinner  the drink were tasti  the appet tidbit for two vari from good to uninteresting

w move on to the dine room  it was a thursday night and the place was d ecid e mpti a nd d evoid dead of custom  i tri one of the special which was some sort of thai inspir noodl with curri and some seafood and peanut and some mild pepper spici andandandi frank dont rememb what it was suppos to be becaus it frank wasnt anyth  too mani thing go on noth made a big impress  

the other diner appar chose better becaus 23 of them were happi with their dinner  wait if there were 4 of us and i wasnt thrill and onli 2 of the other 3 diner were happi that mean that 2 of the 4 or 50 of the diner were underwhelm  now if trader vic had been travel north on a train at 75 mph and had 160 mile to travelwait i think i just had a flashback to sixth grade math  

ok my bottom line impress of trader vic  kind of cool atmospher interest histori i think they were own by merv griffin and the food was averag at a premium price   oh and the bathroom were veri nicemiss happi hour so we sat in the loung at 615 for some appet crab rangoon was tasti as were the rib the sauc to dip them in were bad  hot mustard was too nasali and the cocktail sauc was just that servic was noth to write home about until we tri to use our groupon and were told we need to be in the dine room to use it sinc we spent over 50 sit 5 feet away from the dine room this left a sour tast in my mouth i thought the idea of use the groupon program was to get new custom into the restaur unfortun for them ill flush the  i spent on the groupon itself becaus i cant make it back there befor it expir next week and no one at the restaurantbarloungenondiningroom thought it was import to fill me in on this funni i couldnt tell the differ between the dine room or the loung becaus for one there were tabl in both section for two both section were empti so what the hell doe it matter where i sit good job trader vic  your futur sale prevent program was a great success today

in respons to manag comment below  i did not go to the bar dure the happi hour i went dure off hour and paid full price for a plate of fri vittl gahmy last few visit to ping pang pong have been less than stellar  sure i realli thought they were the best dim sum experi in vega compar to the other few we have but they have been go downhil sinc that veri first visit and review  

first off there arent that mani dish offer anymor  they use to have a larger varieti and now they are lack  they dont even offer the big fs favorit  the macanes egg tart which realli put a damper on thing  they appar are tri out this new egg souffl dish instead  i havent seen the pickl pig feet ever again as well  blah

servic was pretti horribl too  i thought it was becaus i get dump at the corner tabl all the time but i just think it suck  the last time we ate there last month we didnt even have all our dish and serv utensil befor the dim sum arriv  it took awhil to wave down a waiter and get some tea  we order a plate of singapor noodl and that took forev to come out as well  

and it so random when it busi  on one saturday i went there was no wait  and then other time it a good half an hour wait for a parti of four  you just never know

howev i have sinc request that we go back and tri the other dim sum place in vega again sinc ppp leav me less than happi and not satisfi  the big f claim that when he went without me they had ton of stuff come out  mayb im bad luck or somethi am in limbo about gilley i love countri music i enjoy peopl watch i tend to not care where i go after enough drink and so gilley would seem like a perfect place for this i might not have had enough drink in me to prepar me for the sensori overload but i just felt out of place 

the drink are definit strip price the cocktail waitress clad in bikini and chap make their way around the floor rather often one of the aspect that turn me off the most was that i signal to be cut off when my friend were order drink and the girl ignor me and brought me a drink anyway i was plan on leav soon and want to sober up but the sale was more import than my wish this has happen a few time on the strip and that is a main deterr  as to whi i avoid  touristi attractive never ever use the word meh but i have to for this place  it realli cute decor nice and the waitstaff was great if a bit slow  fresh homemad tortilla chip and salsa were the key to my enjoy of the food here  i pig out on them  julia and i were in that im so hungri im cranki mood so i stuf my face with the chip forev  fresh basket were brought often as well as each of us get our own salsa bowl  oh and a complimentari bowl of guac cant hurt either
then the entre came  i was want ooeygooey cheesesmoth enchilada  i got the mushroom and spinach  it came with a side of black bean and rice  the enchilada were made proper the tortilla were softfri proper befor ad the fill  but not a lot of stuf  a few mushroom a few leav of lettuc and that pretti much it  they were cover in a green sauc  bare cover in green sauc  i was disappoint to say the least  the rice  noth fanci  the bean  meh
th onli thing that save my meal was the compani julia and dossti and the neverend suppli of chip  
i probabl wont go back  marisco playa hermosa is right near there and id make that drive anydaythis buffet is locat at south point which is a bit further from the strip but we were here for the rodeo competit and were hungri so to the buffet we headed

for 15 we went in for lunchwhich includ mimosa 

they had normal buffet foodbut it wasnt great qualiti i still ate 3 plates

i ate becaus i was hungrybut when your in vega the citi of buffet there are better buffet to venturthis place doesnt do it for me it a nice spacious place that is clean and has friend employe but i guess im just not a fan of the kalua pork i like the katsu sauc that i put over the pork but overal my tastebud were underwhelm by the kalua porkthe blacken swordfish of the day was cook perfect but the chef drown it in pepper which was unfortun becaus otherwis this fish would have been delici the squash soup also a special of the day tast like it came from a can the servic here is veri good but the food just doesnt add upi am so disappoint with my experi this past saturday night i made a reserv for a girl night with my sister and some friend i had heard amaz thing about the food so we thought wed get dress up and give it a try

w call on our way to let the staff know we were run a few minut behind and were about 5 peopl less than we anticip they were fabul and made sure we didnt lose our spot in the process kudo to the ladi up front they were great

when we were seat we immedi got to look over our menu i have a dairi allergi so i had plan ahead and read the menu onlin on the websit they offer a vegan menu so i happili chose the ravioli in advanc as a dish i dont normal get to eat when our waiter cameron arriv we were all prepar with our choic and even order an appet i order the ravioli even though the vegan menu wasnt present to us someon order a steak and one of our friend order the chicken alfredo with an addit of shrimp as well  as the waiter took each of our order he ask if we want a hous or ceasar salad we were excit for our food 

about 10 minut later i receiv my salad bread and then a veri unprofession tap on the shoulder  the waiter was there to let me know that the vegan ravioli are not avail but they had a meatless chicken marsala a meatless chicken bruscetta and a meatless burger i let him know that i am allerg to dairi but i do eat meat so id rather see the regular menu if possibl he kind of just stare at me like i had a few extra head and then move to grab me the menu when he return he hover while i made my select i explain i would like the lemon herb chicken but i would need it made with oil and not butter if that how it made again the waiter look at me like i was crazi so i ad pleas tell the kitchen staff i have a dairi allergi no worri and again he stare and he said well you cant have mash potato no can you you see the menu doesnt tell you what the side are onli that they are pare by a chef so i told him no to which he repli so veggi and pilaf then and i said that was fine

then we wait more than 45 minut came and went no appet no water refil no check on us noth our food arriv and our friend dish did not have both chicken and shrimp it had just shrimp so we explain to the expeditor the issu and that we never receiv out appet we explain that we werent mad just want to make sure that these item were not on our final bill the expeditor said hed let our waiter know a few moment later the waiter show up with a manag and they apolog for the mix up though the waiter did not seem veri sincer 

we finish our meal and our plate were clear pretti quick the waiter came back and seem much more sincer he admit that he had just plain forgot to input our appet he hand us a desert menu and let us know we could pick one desert on the hous we excit start look over the menu


15 minut later we had to flag over the waiter for our check we let him know while the offer was nice we now had to go so we did not want our free dessert he insist that we take it to go we explain that we could not trust that we would get it quick and thus onli want our check 

a few minut later the check was drop on our tabl and to my absolut disappoint i found our salad for a fee on our check the waiter never explain that we were pay for salad we each order our entre and then the waiter ask hous salad or ceasar we were led to believ that was part of our meal so we flag down a manag we explain the situat and he state the salad have a price on the menu in a condescend tone salad have a price everywher that way if that all you want to eat you can order that such crap so he state if we want hed take the salad off and walk away and then from behind our booth he hand our check back and said here and upon inspect our of the salad remain we paid it but onli becaus wed had enough

imagin your favorit andor averag chines food deliveri place

now divid the flavor in half

now multipli the price by 3

perfect now find a place that isnt pf chang to eat tonight

seri though you are pay for mediocr food in a trendi environ  trendi is anoth way of say long wait and stupid employe  the oliv garden  italian food  pf chang  chines food analog doesnt even work here  and i make fun of oliv garden all the time

if you are realli determin to get mediocr chines food find a pei wei  it own by the same famili and is the same food but for less  and if your look for a pei wei in temp az just go to tott asian diner  it in the same strip mall and it way way betterthe first thing i saw when i walk in was a beauti floral depart pleasant way to start my shop experi that led perfect into the bright color produc depart with odd sensual mood light all the better to hid imperfect on organ produc with i dont know but organ was stamp on near everyth to the point that you had to realli look for regular produc i will say that i like the clear box store the produc in the wall section it made the depart look cleaner and more organ than usual

found the clearanc section in the small hall between the meat and bakeri depart along the back wall everyth max out at half off and most of the select is nichemarket good that are typic overpr in the first place glutenfre chocol chunk cooki mix miniatur salt chocol bar for origin price 5 etc but right across is a freezer section with some clearanc item too snag a pint of frozen vanilla greek yogurt for 2 nice

th cat foodlitt aisl was price similar to smith which is anoth way of say overpr unless you go for the ghetto bottomshelf bag varieti i have no idea howwhi peopl spend 10 on gravel for their cat to poop on this chain is wack

th servic when check out was a littl awkward i work with rocki who is a manag when check out with a huge line i was inform that i would need to fill out an applic for their membership card in order to get the sale price even though im not from here and have the tx licens to back it up and havent live anywher they have locat and there isnt one anywher near me she push it which was a littl irrit as a manag i know there is a way to simpli swipe a store card and move on mayb if the line hadnt been sixdeep this wouldnt have been an issu but there was an audibl sigh of frustrat from the two peopl who overheard behind me in line

tldr look for sale regular price are high get a card or they wont honor their priceso your look hot and feel the fire in your white tuxedo you have a bodaci babe on each arm theyr lick their lip wait for you to roll a 7 at the crap tabl becaus that mean a wild menag a troi with dom perignon champagn and caviar at the fanciest penthous suit in the venetian you let one of the bodaci babe blow on the dice you roll crap you lose

th bodaci babe leav you for the dweeb on a win streak at the next tabl you have to kill your reserv at aquaknox the venetian most exclus restaur where do you go loser whi you come to the second floor food court and eat at nathan of cours yes they have one here in the otherwis plush casino hotel i guess the food court is for the rest of us who are too stingi to consid drop some doremi to dine at the nicer places

i had the chilichees dog with their standout crinklecut fri you know the tray of fri with the red plastic pick on top that make you think for a moment that you went to sizzler and order a steak those are kinda too good in a greasi way the dog not so much look at the pictur i upload in the galleri is that appet to you oh realli i guess i know which side of the railroad track you come from

food  25 starsa dog and those fries
ambi  2 starsit a food courtwhat dya expect a hostess with bodaci tata to take you to your plastic table
servic  2 starsuhhhwhat
tot  2 starssorri nathan coney island just call for youdefinit fall into the what where they think categori our  neighborhood pei wei  a block from our offic and a week favorit for 5 year has chang to pei wei asian market  a sort of cheap food court concept without the mall obvious this is a more inexpens oper to run portion are a lot smaller and about a dollar or two cheaper not all bad but mani favorit seem to be gone 

plastic has replac the restaurantwar and not cool custom plastic but basic restaur suppli takeaway stock no green pr there the warm pfasian decor has been replac by a basic black and industri box with so much park lot glare dure lunch that it hard to select your plastic utensil from the selfserv area the restaur is now noisi and the seem uncomfort staff call out order number add to the din 

now in all fair weve tri the restaur a few time sinc the reopen the food was fine everi time and the flavor good not where id go if i was hungri but the valu seem good truli if this was in the mall it would like do fine unfortun it not ala we mourn the loss of our local pei weii havent been here in quit some time so this review might be a bit dated

even so though i high doubt they caught up with sapphir or the rhino in the past coupl months

it was a nice chang from the norm but i doubt id come back the girl just were not that cute a coupl of them that approach the tabl i was at were stumbl drunk and it just wasnt the best time ever ill stick with my old standard you can never realli go wrong at sapphirso we just left treasur on our last night in vega we had a parti bus drop us off for no charg and the two drink minimum was fine and easili understand drink were strong the girl were sweet and veri talent so whi the two stars

mi beau went up to a girl to tri to get his friend a danc and on his way up he accident drop his win from earlier that night befor i had a chanc to even say anyth a girl ran over and pick it up and ran back to some dude lap i confront her about it and she was about to give it back to me when some senior stripper told me ani money on the floor is fair game and the girl stuck the money back in her purse

i was have an absolut amaz time until then we left right after that there no reason to give ani more money to thiev 

watch your back when your therei had such high hope for this place especi after read all of these great review and i was thorough disappoint 

first of all they request that you do not make ani chang to their menu item  which is just nut to me i couldnt request that a salad not have mushroom thrown on top for some reasonappar it too much troubl 

second of all the one or two thing i did find on the menu without mushroom were salad and one didnt even come with lettuc so i default to anoth salad and it came how it came  which was pretti bad the dress had no flavor whatsoev and the salad as a whole was just bore iceberg lettuc red pepper and artichok heartsthat it 

now my cowork all love their meal so i may give them anoth shot but it not like ani place that doesnt let you modifi your order is just not a place i want to goeuro cafe use to be in mesa across from fiesta mall
w love the pizza and the fries
then they close 

so when we saw they had reopen in gilbert we got rather excit 

then we went to the new gilbert locat 

they have no pizza oven so without our favorit menu item we were forc to start tri the other pricey item in their larg but restrict menu over sever visit it all been fine but noth been great 
on our last visit we tri the spinachbal appet thing and there was some strong herb or someth that tast almost like chlorin we got through most of 1 out of 5 ball then ask the server to take it away they didnt offer to replac it with anyth else
when our bill came the appet was still on there and it was like pull teeth to get them to take it off they final did but this last experi left such a bad tast in our mouth both liter and figur that we wont be come back

ambi 3 too small but there are some cute thing in their shop area
restroom 2 outsid with a key  lame
food 3 no substitut and much of it is overpriced
servic 2 often understaf weird with food issues

if you feel you still must go get the fri appet  still pretti dang goodan interest place themewis  quaint crowd as the name suggest european in both look and feel a bit fussi somehow huge menu i realli like the pasta salad i order  huge portion as previous mention howev afterward i couldnt help think damn i could do this myself at home 

it inspir me to explor vinagrett in general and eat more veget which is a good thing and i was right about be abl to make the dress btw walmart has this new thing call a multimix which is great for make and store your own vinagrett at home check out epicuri but i digress 

to wrap up huge menu ok to good food most high price especi on dessert item i took home the peanut butter cheesecak but was not impress with it plus it was about 6 a slice the case definit beckon but i wouldnt fall to temptat there again

also notabl the wait staff was slow unrespons and not particular friend even though there was onli one other coupl in the whole restaur mayb theyv been told to be that way in line with the european theme just kid but it doe make one wonderi often use extrem in my reviewsbest servic or worst logoyou get the idea unfortun im not concern about overus superl in this review instead eat at euro cafe turn out to just be weird like serious weird

w walk into the cutesi gift shopwait area think lgo for old ladi and we were greet by a veri chipper young teenag hostess with whom we had some fun pleasant banter i was thinkinghmm this place should be cool befor we sat down i glanc over to the larg dessert case whichfrom my friend recommendationswa like to be the highlight of the visit and i was a bit surpris to see that it was halfempti and this was at 7pm on a saturday night

i wasnt too worri though our server seem great at first she actual just sat down at our tabl and talk all about the menu with ussh was veri help and made a coupl of recommend she proceed to take our drink order for me a glass of the malbec and for my dine companion a vanilla latt we had to retri on the wine becaus they were out of the malbec but no big deal right our drink arriv and she ask us if we had decid on our entreesthi was when her attitud got a bit weird and pushi we told her what entre we want but befor we could even tell her that we also want to tri an appet she jet away from the tabl if i may add she left the tabl grab my companion latt without ask if she was finish she still had about 10 of the drink she want to enjoy

th server then brought our salad their salad is a nice standard mix green and i order the yogurt dress which was quit nice we finish our salad and be the good former server i am i place our platesalong with my forkin a small prebuss stack on the side of our tabl my friend ask me if i thought they would want me to reus my fork and i repli im not plan on eat a 20 entre with a reus fork note im awar that 20 isnt like haut cuisin price but i mean i just dont think you should have to lick the dress off of  a salad fork to eat your entre at that price point what happen next was veri weird the waitress stop by saw my dirti fork on top of my prebuss pile then proceed towhil i sat there perfect still and silenttak my dirti fork off of my salad plate and move it over to my place set next to my clean knife weird

then our entre came well they were realli toss at us more than anyth she drop the pork tenderloin in front of me and the almond tortellini in front of my friend which is especi odd sinc the server had made such a big deal about me be a vegetarian im not surpris though i hadjust five minut earlierseen a fullon food auction at the tabl next to us becaus the server had no idea who order what anyway back to our food our server just drop the food and walk away befor we could say anythingnot ask doe everyth look ok or is there anyth els i can get for you of cours it wasnt the end of the world for us to have to switch our plate it was just realli weird

th good news is that my almond tortellini was amaz it was full of fun surpris like sunflow seed and pine nut and the sauc was heaven the tortellini were the perfect textur and consist my dine companion order the tenderloin and although i couldnt tri ani of it i couldnt help but notic that the amount of saw it requir to cut off a bite was more reminisc of a pork chop than a tenderloin in spite of the dryness of the meat  it look to be a nice balanc of flavor with a cherri sauc grill onion and horseradishi mash potato the odd servic continu though no one ever check back to ask about the food and when my friend water went empti it was a full 8 12 minut for the hostess to final come by and refil it even more odd was that onc we had clear finish our entre it was a long time befor anyon came by to take away our plate it was 18 minut between our last bite and when our server came back yes i was keep track by now becaus the whole thing was just so odd she offer dessert but by this time we both just want to leav so we ask for the check

when she brought back the check and my card she sudden was miss person tell us how glad she was that we came and how much she look forward to see us again honest i wish she had been so help when we were actual still have our meal

overal the environ at this restaur is just plain weird and uncomfort i would love to eat the tortellini again but if the price for enjoy that great dish is sit through anoth hour of awkward in this restaur ill just have to go withoutmy wife and i tri the euro cafe this weekend place is small and quaint with a huge dessert display case in the entranc and look amaz we were greet by friend hostess and server and were excit to give it a try

receiv our menus all i can say is wow  overwhelm although mani item seem to share similar ingredi it extrem difficult to do that larg of a menu well  especi in such a small restaur 

we got even more nervous when we saw one of the staff walk right through the dine area with a larg bag of frozen stuf pasta to the kitchen this happen again later with someth els but i couldnt see what was in the bag not sure if they are make trip to the groceri store or they have a walkin in a differ area of the build but it wasnt veri profession and was an indic of what was to come 

anyway the food well it look nice and was a larg portion but it went downhil from there both entre seem like a confus jumbl of flavor and textur overwhelm by the differ marinatedflavor ingredi that made up the dish in both case the protein shrimp chicken tast like they were boil or poach and had littl flavor 

anyway mayb we just order the wrong thing but to be honest i wont take the chanc again to find the better one mayb the chefown need to reduc his menu by 5075 and concentr on what work well it pretti hard to do 100 menu item my estim without compromishow i write yelp review by andrew k fromaz this is my real name my real nom de plume

i start out by identifi an establish i vagu want to tri and find an occas or reason to go there  in this case a fellow yelper christina p set up a special happi hour event on a friday at half moon sport grill on highland  id been to half moon befor and it was not exact on my list of place to hurri back to and tri again for reason which will gradual becom evident

i get to the restaur and go in briefli if at all take note of the decor the attitud of the staff i encount along the way the crowd the music play occasion the light anyth that jar or that i happen to notic that i like  this is how i and anyon els fortun enough to have full use of their five sens determin the vibe of a place  
half moon seem like a typic upperti sport bar pleasant hostess appar clean lot of big tvs small booth  noth not to like honest  the vibe is that this is a pretti nice place  

i sit down and look over the menu search for anyth that particular catch my interest  im not a picki eater so usual i have a hard time narrow it down to one thing  the first time i was here i was pretti hungri so the blue chees burger caught my eye  on a more recent visit appet were on happi hour so i tri a few of those  here the bottom line  none of it was veri good  like i would activ avoid eat ani of the food again  the pretzel which was recommend was dri insid and oili outsid  like it had been coat with some form of fake butter  the burger was onli ok  the boneless wing were the onli thing that i would order again i think we got medium

anyway over the cours of the visit i put togeth all of these impress and write a review usual decid whether or not ill return  sorri half moon i want to love you but i dont think ill be back anytim sooni realli give it 25 star we went here my sister bday i was extrem under impress 

we got alot of stuff and it was either so so or real bad 

calamari the grossest shit ive ever had it was like the consist of a cold stiff mozzarella chees stick and it had that shape too it wasnt cut into ring it was big thick stick the batter was like microwav seem becaus it had 100 no crisp or flavor i would be shock if it wasnt prebatt and frozen gross

tuna tar tar it was just minc raw tuna but they didnt add ani like flavor oil or citrus on it it was just complet unseason the fish had no flavor which is good but it was veri plain 

sear tuna the sauc was good the noodl i like tuna was ok this dish alon i would give 35


i would never come back here the food was bad and just realli blah especi for a place that special in fishsad  you charg 20 for an omelett but your too cheap to buy real tabasco  the gunk in the bottl didnt even look like tabasco and here a real hot newsflash  an empti water glass is there for a reason man what a wastmeh
im not sure what all the hubbub is about this place 
ye the portion are huge but person it doesnt make the food tast ani better
i mean the food isnt bad but it not greatidk it sort of just tri too hard in my opinion i feel like theyr tri to stuff too mani flavor into one dish  ive been there about three time and everi time i leav super stuf but kind of disappoint but that just me 

sometim less is morewow  can we say big fat disappointment

th first time i tri to line up here they said it would be a 15 hour long wait  good thing we decid to go elsewher becaus if i wait 15 hour to eat hash hous i would have been even more upset

th second time i came back we were seat within 15 minut  outsid you see pictur of celebr that have eaten at hash hous  the main reason i decid to visit hash hous was becaus of the rave review adam richman gave on man vs food  adam your credibl is serious on thin ice with me after my experi here

hash hous is locat insid the imperi palac hotel along the strip  is it just me or doe this place feel cold and unclean  

servic here was also iffi  it took our waitress a while for her to come over and take our drink order and the restaur wasnt even full  she also disappear at the end of our meal after she drop off our check  then she charg us an extra 250 for a split plate  ridicul  if i could give a negat star on servic i would

hash hous is all present  their dish come out look massiv  andrew d and i order the chicken egg benedict and i was serious disappoint  egg benedict is my favorit breakfast meal but the dish serious lack flavor and kick  i was wait for my tast bud to be stimul but ala it was bland  i end up have to season the thing to the best of my abil with the tabasco sauc ketchup and black pepper we had at the table

our whole group left feel unsatisfi and a littl bitter for have to wast our money on this place  iiii felt bad also for make the group come back not onc but twice to give it a try

do yourself a favor and find anoth place to have breakfast at  hash hous is all talk and no flavorundoubt the view at top of the world is breathtak gorgeous five star if all we are yelp on is view alone

but i cant eat a view so top of the world rank consider more south of the equat in my book

food
entre are price from 45  65 side are a la cart which mean if you want more than just a slab of meat on your plate you will probabl dish out anoth 20 i find this kind of price a littl deceit and offens even so it would have been fine with me if the food was good unfortunately

pric are approxim i dont have that kind of memory
chilean sea bass 45  bore and bland not so much moist as it was soggi no distinct flavor at all it was encrust with porcini mushroom dust but it could have been pixi dust for all i could discern it was also serv on wilt romain lettuc which i think romain lettuc should never be serv as better choic would have been wilt babi spinach kale or even beet greens
im a big huge fan of sea bass and found this dish quit disappointing

asparagus 10  christ these were the soggiest blandest asparagus ive ever had were they boil in unfilt tap water for an hour cook for just a second longer and you could have scoop these up in a jar and stuck a gerber label on it asparagus tast amaz broil or grill with mayb a slight glaze of oliv oil and a pinch of sea salt  none of which will compet with the natur flavor and sweet of this greenstalk peesmellchang to have such a simpli delici veget strip of ani nutrient or flavor is downright  veggi blasphemi i was tempt to throw a stalk at the revolv window just to see what the staff would do 

lobster mash potato 14 ooooooh how i want to love this dish two of my favorit food mate in one big bowl what could possibl go wrong ala the potato were so dri i could have use them to plaster that crack in my bedroom ceil there was some kind of bbqflavor gravi and littl chunk of lobsterit wasnt horribl but i wasnt impress 

garlic mash potato 10 technic my bfs dish but of cours i nosh too dri uninspir and i couldnt discern ani real garlic roast those sucker and blend them in folk 

ribey 50 bfs meal sinc i dont eat cow he actual like his meal it was cook perfect and had great textur howev he said he had better on mani occasions

overal my impress is that top of the world cater to a veri base culinari crowd those whom are so distract and awestruck by the view that they actual think the mediocr food they are shovel into their mouth tast good 

we end up spend almost 200 for a dinner for two im includ the 40 it cost us to get from mgm to stratospher and back becaus im a bit bitter about it i would have been so much happier eat at ani of the restaur within our own hotel we didnt even order ani wine alchohol or dessert

aft dinner we took the elev up to the observatori deck outdoor which was incred  you can see all of vega includ the main strip i tri to convinc my pusssi bf to ride the rollercoast with me but he wasnt have it 

bottom line eat at a real restaur then go up to the observatori deck for the astound view without the huge markup on subpar black angus type foodvalentin even 2013 my wonder husband surpris me with dinner at this restaur as we had never been to either the stratospher or the restaur befor i was so look forward to a wonder even with one of my bestest friend and my wonder husband unfortun the experi as a whole left a bad tast in my mouth it was a combin of the manag of the facil as well as anoth diner in the restaur that honest i wish i was abl to confront for ruin such a wonder evening

without let that situat put a bias on my review of their food it was mediocr at best and serious overpr for what we had tri to consum befor be rude interupt by the manag it seem that one of the other diner near us were offend by our laughter and enjoy enthusiasm for be togeth and certain word that were spoken at my tabl the manag then approach our tabl look at me direct and ask that we refrain from these activ immedi now pleas keep in mind i spent well over 200 dollar for dinner and had not even been serv as yet i prompt request to know whom had made such a request of us as i intend to embarass and humili them as they had done to me mayb not the best approach but honest  who in their right mind is so narcassist to believ that they are allow to go out in public then mandat that the public behav in the way they deem they should if you are so easili offend by other stay at home and dont ever leave

back to dinner i gather my thing my 25 dollar valentin day dinner pictur my bff and left my husband to deal with get our dinner to go we had split some of the meal with my friend so he had 2 card and some cash he want to give toward the dinner with the intent of give cash to the waitress after the transact as a tip we prefer tip in cash as we believ the server are not tax on this and get to keep more of it  if that make sens i am not real clear on what the cash portion my husband provid was for as i think he had want to get chang from it but it seem the waitress took it upon herself not to return 20 dollar of that cash funni she was go to receiv a much larger tip than 20 dollar as she was excel it was her manag that was the jerk but just take the money and not return it allow us to assum that all she thought she deserv and we did not offer anyth more 

all in all as i indic the food realli wasnt all that compar to other place we have been to with similar offer the price was not fit of the qualiti of food the servic was excel but that last littl action was uncal for the manag need a class in peopl skill and the onli real redeem qualiti this place has is that it sit at the top of the stratospher spin and provid a nice view of the strip when your tabl final get there if it was just an observ deck with a bar it could have been a much better place to go overal i was pretti bum that this place seem to get a lot of hype but realli is disappoint in the enda friend and i decid to tri this place for their 2999 ayc crab leg this come with soup or salad and dessert  i was excit sinc i hadnt had crab leg in a veri long time  we decid to sit at the bar   they werent over busi in the entir place so i figur servic wasnt go to be a problem  big fat wrong our waitress took a while to even come over to get our drink order  and even to bring them to us 

we both order the new england clam chowder they offer manhattan also this also took a while to get place in front of us  hmmm  are you see a trend here i will say the clam chowder was realli good they bring a bread basket so this went well with the soup

and we wait  and wait and wait for the crab  onc it was brought out it was delici  it was serv with a small piec of corn on the cob and red potato  i didnt tri the side sinc i was devour the crab about 2 minut after we got our first plate of crab anoth plate was brought out and set in front of us  this would have been great if we were almost done with the first   when we start on the second plate they were alreadi cold bummer of cours cold crab is fine but just not what i was want then our finish plate sat in front of us for a veri long time  was she realli that busi  no  even just a how is everyth wouldv been nice

fin dessert was brought out  it was a littl banana nut cake with whip on the side i would say it was good not great  i ate about half  

so the meal was good  the servic was absolut horribl i guess i would say that i probabl wont be back sinc there are mani other place to get crab leglook like  solid twos are the thing here   was seat quick  order taken quick and  first round of drink all appear go quit well 
the garlic fri  came out short after and  that when it start to go from  4 star  downward  

cajun pasta 
 noth origin or subtl    i should known better   monoton tast with all the right shape present but it a hit of their sauc and that all you get for the rest of the meal  

ni steak sandwich 
massiv  but dri the sauc was minim and  the lack of drink stop erin from get through more than a third of it  also had those wonder garlic fri but they either need to revisit the sauc  and  perhap trim the gristl off  come to think of it this was a lame 14  sandwich  

coffe   tepid  like it be heat by a lamp  onli had to suffer two of these 

servic start out great but  the drink stay dri for most of the meal this was not on game night rush hour  so it look like the usual mis match of staff to custom that seem to be phoenix area special in casual dine     mediocr   to the point that i cant even  make fun of the place   it just not worth it  for non beer drinker i cant see this be a place to seek out when  their close but tastier analog that actual has hard cider yard hous is within a mile awayrubio you look pretti good now  consid this a strong175 star  the servic was veri good  

i had fish taco  when they arriv i thought it was fish stick cover in a red sauc  after i probe it with my fork i realiz it was a rectangular portion from some kind of fish fillet  done medium well  someth that should never be done with fish  the pinto bean were averag and the rice was below averag with a few crunchi grain mix in

 the menu awesom select of tibetaninfluenc food along with some american staples
 decent beer select all bottles
 awesom sangria the ginger  wow
 water were pour no ice without asking

 server were harri and rush they were clear understaf and our server made it her point to continu inform us of how bad thing were whi dont they have more folk on staff dure the rush hours

 we order a salad and ask for the dress on the side it arriv fulli dress not a big deal as the salad was excel as is but such a simpl request was ignor we couldnt flag down our server to get it corrected

 small plate were a mix bag the flatbread plate awesom especi the walnutroastedpepp hummus the pakauda includ copious amount of green bell pepper of which my girlfriend is not a fan of and yet there was no mention of them on the menu

 entre were again mix the night special of norwegian salmon was superb  veri flavor and well execut perfect sear luicous salmon with fragrant veggi not sure it was worth 20 but it was tasti the salmon was mayb 35 ounc my girlfriend dish of chicken chaula was suppos to includ ginger garlic cilantro and chili instead it was dri bland and came serv on a bed of sticki rice with a boatload of green bell pepper red bell pepper and a few other stringi veggies

 refil took forev and when we tri to flagdown our server we often didnt see her for long bit of time 

 not a good valu our meager meal for two 3 drink flatbread a small plate and an entre total out at 66 befor tip base on what we receiv id say that was a bit outrageous


although i live 15 block from here i doubt ill be back it too pricey the servic was too spotti and the dish that i had high hope for were too uninspir we chat about the rate and i origin plan to rate this place at 3star but after digest the experi for a few hour im left feel sour so it 2stardont give thank here
it been a while sinc ive post but for anyon who cant rememb  see my motto abov and i get even more piss when it expens bad food 

so imagin my mood when we left quiessenc yesterday have drop 171 for 2 includ tax  tip on a meal that  was certain wors than what i could make at home
i had the date  beet salad the turkey entre and the appl crisp for dessert serv famili style were green sausag  onion stuf roast carrot  parsnip mash potato and a bread basket

il start from the begin with the salad which was ok not what youd expect for the price but accept the turkey was brine in an over salt liquid with someth odd ad it was moist but i still left slice on my plate the flavor was so odd

th stuf had veri littl flavor at all  was dri the sausag ad noth but meat so  that the vegetarian couldnt eat it the mash potato were also over salt the carrot  parsnip were sever undercook hard as rock or mayb they were overcook  dehydr sinc a few of them were mush the green were good all of the side dish were left over there were 3 kind of bread in the basket a dri foccacia corn bread  a soak with oil or butter corn bread they all seem like they were from the previous day  someon had tri to save them

w all had the appl crisp with cranberri ice cream for dessert it was also ok  the crisp was good but need lemon juic to cut the sweet the ice cream was an iron chef moment  not a good one i remov as much as i could  pour a littl cream suppli for the coffe on my crisp oh for some vanilla hagendazs

w were tire of count penni and thought wed splurg wed all been to quiessenc befor when there was a differ chef it a love locat but not enough to make up for the food 
on the day that i usual give thank for the bounti of life  i start plan thanksgiv dinner for next yeari consid my foray here to be a complet yelp letdown  i arriv at approxim 10 pm and still face a 2 hour wait to be seat with approxim 1015 peopl ahead of me in line  the reason for the long wait is the limit bar seat  there are approxim 16 seat and onli 6 roast pan so at ani given time half the bar is eat and half are wait for the food with each turnov take approxim 40 minut  

onc seat there is an addit 30 minut wait for food  math check youv now invest 25 hour so it better be some mindblow food to overcom the intermin wait time  look around the face of my fellow diner it was clear that oyster bar did not deliv  we all look sullen and grumpi  reason given it was past midnight and we were all starv 

if you want faster susten i recommend get a bowl of clam chowder  even that took about 15 minut to arriv  it was nondescript in everi way 

i order the palac pan roast with lobster shrimp and crab in a creami tomato base   the open cook system admit is a decent show and i enjoy watch the chef make our dish  there are steam pot and into them go in this particular order and at design time 1 a pat of butter 2 your seafood 3 clam broth 4 the tomatocream soup and 5 a scoop full of crab meat  john gumbo was similar  first the butter then veget and seafood clam broth a dark roux and a scoop of crab meat 

the problem is that there is a haphazard time system  all the butter goe into all the pot at onc  then the chef come back around for the seafood  onc the broth and soup go in he usual take that opportun to focus on shuck the bivalv  it was a  new form of tortur watch your food bubbl furious away while the chef manhandl a dozen oyster or prepar shrimp cocktail  liter all you want to do was reach out and help yourself to the soup and instead the chef spent a quarter of an hour on each fruit de mer plate 

the wait was certain not worth it  the chef spent so much time on the shuck that i think our dish overreduc   my pan roast was an inch lower in volum than the next item and i knew it was go to be salti   you get a big soup bowl full of a creami tomato soup one scoop of rice a few shrimp and lot of crab piec  the proport were so off  i would have that much soup for a famili of four and at least two scoop of rice apiec  i dont know how anyon could have spoon so much salti soup without anyth to soak it up  john gumbo was similar except it tast like liquifi roux  

we also saw some unsanitari behavior go on  the chef wash the steam pot after empti their stew into the bowl and left the bowl inch from the pot he was wash certain to let dish water get into the food  not appethave dinner out on a thursday even it was slow over at mi casa grill cantina  the hostess almost  took us all around befor seat us in the corner of  this huge dine area that was nice decor and had a lot of promis  we were seat in front of a giant screen tv show thursday night football

aft our beverag order were taken chip and three salsa arriv at our tabl  there was one lime base tamarind sauc that the bf was practic drink while i had an affin to the spici red pepper color one  we were veri impress alreadi and couldnt wait for our orders

aft decid on the manaza 7 appl rum lime juic and mint for myself and the caprinha 8 for the bf we realiz our waiter was veri new  at his job and at this restaur  it humor us nonetheless as he had troubl understand and pronounc our drink order  the bfs caprinha was a bit too strong for his like and my manzana was pretti much an appl mojito  it was a lot tastier than his drink that for sure  

we decid to ask for his recommend on food item sinc they had an extens list  he gave us some idea on whether to order tapa or go straight for the main cours or do the mix and match  

we decid to tri out a bunch of differ thing by go for the appet sampler 17 and the mix and match entre of three item 17  we had the waiter bring out all the food togeth so we can enjoy it all at the same time

th food was rather quick to come and just as well sinc we had alreadi finish off a basket of chips

th appet sampler came with two corn cake that were sauc up and top with guacamol  the bf thought the cake were pretti decent   two chicken flaunta also came with the sampler  i found it to be dri out and tasteless  the adobo season deep fri calamari was left in the oil too long and the bf couldnt tast ani of the season  these item were laid out on a bed of coleslaw and came with three dip sauc  a dill base cream sauc a chipotl sauc and the limebas tamarind sauc from earlier  there was also a cup of queso fundido which is melt chees that your suppos to dip your tortilla chip in  howev onc the chees start harden up it becom one big goopey mess that pretti challeng to eat with chips

of the mix and match entre we got one shrimp lobster and crab enchilada that wasnt to my like  the bf was appal when he saw and tast what appear to be imit crab meat  blah on that  there was one soft flour tortilla or you can choos the hard corn tortilla instead hold what would be our carn asada taco   it was alright  hide behind that taco was one tini ass what they call a burrito fill with dri carnita  the burrito was small enough to fit into the palm of my hand  was this a kid size  half of the plate was cover with rice and beans

when it came down to it i found myself eat more chip and salsa than the actual food we order  that a bad sign  the onli leftov we took were the chees so we could remelt it the tortilla chip and that lime tamarind sauc 

servic was fine  it took awhil to get our order in but the food came out rather quick  our waiter was nice and friend so no problem there  im glad that we had a gift certif too like allison j becaus it definit not worth the price they are charg   

sidenot they offer a weekday happi hour from 4 pm to 7 pm with 2 chip and guacamol 3 nacho 2 flaunta 3 calamari 1 margarita and 1 tequila shotit pain me to give nove 2 star it use to be my go to for fanci italian my favorit place in las vega i would have given everi experi befor this one 5 star now i will never return 
mi first time here was for my boyfriend birthday a few year ago sinc then we had been back for a chef tast with chef geno with 15 cours a few of our favorit dish includ the risotto of the day nana meatbal chicken marsala and the death by potato this was my first and onli time dine here sinc the chef i had grown to love move on to other ventur 
i still had faith that nove would be a great place without chef geno the menu was almost the same the crowd wasnt the waiter even mention when we ask that the new chef was complet differ not bad just not the same 
well i think he was be polit the exact same chicken marsala dish look the same but tast total differ the meatbal and potato were still decent the gnocchi was too mushi and the risotto oh i wouldnt know as they offer it as the special and then ran out i wait 20 minut and ate my entir appet befor my drink arriv and there was no new chef come out to check on us see how we like the food or introduc himself this alway happen in past time when nove was not busi consid we were there late and the chef was in view it could have happen 
mayb my expect were set too high but i have had total differ experi in the past all of them made me feel great about spend 150300 for dinner for 2 
right now i am thank i had a discount on my ticket from the lisa lampanelli show becaus i would have been mad to pay full price last night 
i realli hope n9ne group and nove figur out a way to put the piec back togeth chef geno we miss youi had been so excit to tri this place base on all the great review from fellow yelper when the groupon pop up we snatch it up 

i realli want to love this place i have to admit i was a littl er a lot disappoint we order the prosciutto di parma e burrata appet to start this was the highlight of the meal the dish was good i order the tagliatell alla bolognes it wasnt as enjoy as i had hope i wasnt a big fan of meat sauc just a littl on the bland side my fella order the petto di pollo ai funghi e cipollin borettan allagro and felt the same about his dish be a bit bland my mom got the lasagnett al forno which was probabl the best of the three entre we order the food just felt underseason which is odd for italian food

a anoth yelper note the decor is a bit date and i felt the food price were on the expens side for what you get

th servic was fantast everyon at this restaur was so welcom and friend attent was the word of the day here even as someon who prefer a littl anonym in a restaur i felt their attent was welcomed

th servic definit outshon the food here unfortunabout 2 week ago i move into to an apart complex that is 14 mile away from the intersect of guadalup and mcclintock at this intersect there is upward of 10 differ dinner choic the major of them chain restaur or fast food be of the shop local temp mindset i ventur to mac broiler  tap a mom and pop joint sandwich between 2 of my favorit place in temp hoodlum music and chang hand bookstor i figur sinc it was in such good compani i would give it a go 

i walk in the door and walk to the empti hostess stand where a sign read pleas wait to be seat be a good drone i did just that i stood there look for the hostess for a good 3 minut wait to be seat final a girl buse tabl look over at me appar confus over whi im just stand there and say you know you can just sit where ever you want so i go and grab a tabl situat myself and i wait and i wait some more about 10 minut later a waitress come over to me and tell me that she will be right with me five minut later she come back and ask if i would like a menu at this point ive now been in the place for about 20 minut i want to say yes that would be just dandi i would like a menu so i can order some food which is the reason whi ive been wait 20 minut i bite my tongu and just say yes thank you

th waitress grab a menu for me doesnt stick around for me to ask for a drink and walk away she return with a water 5 minut later put it on the tabl as she walk by not stop to ask if i had ani question or want someth other than water to drink by now ive look at the menu figur out what i want and want to order i tri flag her down final catch her attent onli to get a curt ill be there in a moment she meander her way over take my order and goe to walk away i stop her and ask if i can get an ice tea with my meal and the look she gave me had to be akin the one shed give someon who just demand her 1st born child a combin of confus and incredul and disbelief 

a bit later she walk by again near drop my ice tea onto the tabl she never stop walk and continu on her way without a word arm with my glass of water and my reluct given ice tea i began the long wait for my order the chicken melt sandwich continu what appear to be the mo of mac i wait for my sandwich and i wait and i wait then get this  i wait some more i wait for over 35 minut for my food and not onc did my waitress come around to see if i need more water i did or more ice tea i didnt but could have use a top off on the glass as it free refil just when i was about to flag the waitress down to ask whi they didnt pluck slaughter and carv up the chicken into the appropri part befor i place my order a she walk out of the kitchen with a plate in hand and bring a plate to my tabl put it down and walk away bare say a word in front of me is my chicken sandwich 

there was bread chicken bacon chees and tomato beauti they got my order correct the chees was melt but kind of cold as if it had been sit there wait for someon to bring it to my tabl the bacon was veri good the chicken was a bit dri but by this time i was starv all in all i was there for an hour befor i got ani food and when i did final get it i was not about to voic a complaint and wait even longer i understand that mac is not a fast food joint nor was i expect it to be howev be joe parti of one in a 14 full restaur i feel that i can expect to receiv my food in well  under an hour hell just by be by myself i should be in fed paid and out in under an hour the waitress never check to see if the food was ok never offer me refil on my water or tea and basic pretend i didnt exist for a local restaur situat between two of temp best local busi i expect a lot more 

needless to say i am sore disappoint with my experi at mac what with high expect due to posit review on here and from peopl i know i never got my waitress name and was basic treat as a nuisanc and not as a pay custom from the minut i walk in and stood at the empti hostess booth look like an idiot to the minut i walk out the front door  

bottom line i could have gone to trader joe to buy the ingredi gone home cook ate and clean up in the time i wast over at mac will i be return anytim soon probabl noti know i realli bust ball with this place the first go round but hell im a pay custom and i expect a littl decenc so 1st go round i just left  never ate so to be fair i order for takeout some pork  rice with some littl egg rolltaquito im not quit sure what they were other than overdon the meat was pretti decentr tender and look good but not ani flavor and the dip stuff was kinda orang marmalad stuff the jasmin rice was realli dri and just flavorless which i guess most rice is but i like some soy or sweet n sour with mine it cost me 950 and i was still hungri after eat this not good not bad just plain and a littl pricii have been go to the roosevelt for almost two year and over time ive becom less and less impress  
at first it was a cool new place that not a lot of peopl knew about but has sinc becom increas more popular and crowd  ordinarili i would be happi to see a small local busi thrive but with it has come an attitud   
case in point i stop by for a drink after a movi this weekend   some friend were come to meet up so i order a glass of wine from the board while i wait  it was aw tast like vinegar at the end  i offer it up to my companion who confirm it was bad so i decid to ask for someth els  i wait for a bit but the server was mia even though the place is tini  i went to the bar and explain to the bartend who gave me a lectur on how they store the wine what temp it kept at 54 for a red and said they go through it so quick there no way it had spoil  she assur me that it was lingonberri i was tast that i probabl didnt like even though i love at the cafe in ikea 
i didnt realli know what to say in respons to her histori lesson so i ask if i could pleas have a glass of the pinot instead  
she said of cours and went to grab the bottl then threw in but just so you know im go to have to charg you for the first glass so you might want to see if ani of your friend want it
i told her to forget it  the onli friend had alreadi tri it and found it equal disgust so we contact our other friend and had them meet us at bar biano instead  at least there you can have beer or wine and also sit outsid  
we use to have frequent happi hour for work at the roosevelt but i wont be recommend it in the futur   this place combin with matt big breakfast is sure make a profit handoverfoot but they cant even bother provid decent servic to the peopl who support them befor food network made them all the ragei dont know whi i even bother tri to go here everi singl time i walk in this place i end up walk right back out i tri to go there with mark j twice in decemb and both time we end up walk out within 120 second lame

th roosevelt is either too crowd or there isnt ani seat or it fill with hipster douch bag or the servic eat a dick

mi recent problem with this place include

 inadequ seating

 huge wast of spacenot laid out well

 staff consist of asshat mix with a few veri cool staffer most of the chick who work here are cool but i encount sever dick tard dudes

 whi is there a secur gaurdrent a cop here at all time he is nice but it is too creepi for comfort what is this the arizona mill mall

on the flipsid the beer select is good and i ate here onc a looooooooooooooong time ago and i think i thought it was good i cant rememb becaus it was so long ago id love to eat here again but i cant seem to toler this place for more than a few minu befor i stomp on off and out the front door

do better roosevelti hate to do this but after today experi i am at a loss

i dont even know where to start  i love go here but someth has to chang  i alway look forward to essencebut today i just shake my head

i went to the counter to order my hamburg with chees and extra 85 cent  which is a new item on the menu which i have had befor  i love it the first time  i was not in the mood for a salad and i ask what i could do for a substitut and they said i could add potato chip for an extra dollar  i let that one slide and then i ask for an ice tea and if it could be in a to go cup and they said that they would have to charg me an extra 50 cent  i ask whi and the girl at the counter said it has to do with refil  but i get refil in my glass correct yes but that is the way the owner has it

now i am a littl annoy but i tri to get over it  my love luncheon date the wonder sarah g thought i was in a bad mood and then i explain my issu with the counter

late lunch was a quich lorrain which came with a side salad  look absolut delici but did not provid the mouthfeel i crave  i was still reel from the bliss onion tart i had at coup des tart and was hope to reclaim that gastronom hit with the cakey quich it was a bit dri  green were also a tad underdress    

i wouldnt order the quich again but i will go back and tri other item  in the meantim ill just admir the photo i took at essencessenc doe have an amaz menu but the last two time ive tri to enjoy myself there it just hasnt happen twice in the last two week ive had experi where i now will never go there again unless a group of friend decid that absolut the onli place they want to go to brunch 

1st experi about two week ago today i had a busi day ahead of me but i had enough time to grab a coffe and some food somewher befor go about my day i was crave their hot breakfast cereal with fruit and know how busi they can get i thought i should probabl just call in a togo order and even if i have to wait a littl while when i get there that fine becaus i can take it with me the first time i call a girl answer the phone and instant ask me if i could hold without even ask how she could help me i said of cours i stay on hold for 15 minut i walk into my coffe shop stood in line order my coffe and when my coffe was done i decid to hang up and redial essenc i call again and sure enough can you hold pleas im think realli but i say of cours again 

im on hold for about 5 minut which is a long time when your alreadi a littl frustrat wait for 15 min the first time i decid to hang up when i pull into their park lot and no one has pick up the phone i walk insid and to my surpris it wasnt as busi as i thought it might be which would justifi the ignor on the phone i walk up to the counter and state i need to place a togo order the look on the girl face was like crap this might be the girl from the phone still i am a patient person and i thought it ok im here now and i can just order as i was order one of the gal who work there was show a girl how to use the regist it all made sens this girl was new and they were tri to train her which was caus everyth to be a littl more back up than usual ok now im not as mad

aft place my order i told the girl i would wait out on the patio the girl retort with a condescend tone say just place your number on the edg of the tabl and well find you although ive been to essenc mani time and knew how their process work with their alreadi awesom lack of servic i felt i need to verbal state where i was go to be 

ok sit on the patio wait for my food for how long now i realiz that there are other peopl who may have order  befor myself but wait 25ish minut for hot oatmeal is just ridicul it get better after i the whole ill be on the patio fiasco i see a girl pace the shop insid hold a togo box look desper for whomev it could possibl belong to at this point im think to myself youv got to be kid me i just sat there and watch her walk around for a good five minut if not longer she final went back to the counter and did an i dont know gestur i decid to final mosey on insid the girl train her saw me frustrat stand up and walk in so she grab the box and some silverwar and hand it to me as i was approach her i was kind despit my annoy and thank her but come on meow really

a week and a half or so goe by and i think to myself ya know what im go to give essenc anoth shot with their ridicul hour i wasnt sure when they stop serv breakfast so i tri to get their as soon as possibl i arriv at  1045am and they stop serv breakfast at 1030am which i will never understand from a busi stand point especi given their awesom locat they are total limit themselv i wasnt annoy or bother or frustrat becaus i could have easili look up their menu hour and chosen somewher els to go know i would miss the breakfast menu same two gal work by the way i was pleasant and order an ice coffe and a simpl side salad somehow my total came to around 9 after a tip im think that fine becaus i know they use freshorgan ingredi and im happi with that and then i also wait forev for my salad and onc it got there the sad pile of green on my plate was enough to erk the evil steph monster out of me i was piss i down my salad in mayb five minut becaus i had to get out of there i ate my salad so fast i didnt finish my ice coffe i walk up to the counter to ask for a togo cup so i could take my remain coffe with me she told me i had to pay extra if i want to take it togo are you serious for a refil it more me but i dont want a refil i simpli want to take the coffe which ive alreadi paid for with me it still more if you want to take it togo she knew i was upset i sat my ice coffe on the counter and left 

i promis i wait a long time and thought about all of this over in my head a few time befor write this review ill miss their breakfast but oh wellive been here 2 time onc alon and onc on a boyfriendtotallymessedupsoorderingthemostexpensivedishonthemenuisamust and i didnt like anyth either time the food was most bland and averag and i comment on the tomato sauc have come straight out of the sysco can and onto my pasta the servic was sluggish and dare i say i felt the server was hate on us for be straight this is probabl the most offput part of our whole experi this also has happen countless time at fez but i digress serious 

i think the decor tri a littl too hard to be someth it most obvious is not they should actual stick to be a neighborhood italian joint instead of the cheesebal fake plant and italian stuff everywher but the oil and herb combo at the begin is a welcom touch and probabl the onli reason im go with 2 star instead of 1

doubt ill be back here alon or with boyfriendi hate to do this to you harley especi consid how fond so mani of my friend are of you but give me a freakin break

can you say overpr can you say complet uninvent menu yes i know that a made up word but it fit so deal with it can you say laughabl wine list i can harleys

i hate to be so harsh but my spaghetti bolognes tast like it came from sbarro at the mall the pasta was soggi the sauc was flavorless i was just complet unimpress from start to finish listen if your go to make and serv lowgrad knockoff italian food be my guest but dont you dare charg higherend price dont even get my start on the 10 salad with dress that so obvious came out of the bottle

in the busi of full disclosur my pasta dish was 800 time better the next day but more like as a result of me ad my own sauc to it befor reheat rather than it magic improv on it own

th onli save grace harley had for me was our server justin he was a doll attent courteous and realli fcking hot so mayb im a littl bias whatev sue me

i realli want to like harley i realli realli did but sad i could not especi not with the parlor open just a coupl of mile up the roadmy typic experi at a buffet 

1 i get my money worth no matter what the price is i repeat no matter what the price is 
2 i eat to the point of almost puke 
3 not 28 buck w gratuiti 

what on earth went wrong at crave pleas consid renam to loss of appetit noth i repeat noth look tempt enough to reach my plate 

i ate a coupl slice of prime rib guacamol and chip some steak fruit done 

everyth els tast old

th gf went irat becaus i was not eat am i sickdefinit not crave this place again

stay at the mirag and on a time schedul this seem to be our closest option for our breakfast choic this earli saturday morning

th place is aesthet pleas and appear to be clean and well kept

 arrang of food was organ to aesthet pleas visual as well make the major of the food item appear quit appet except for a few beat up egg benedicts

unfortunalti look can be deceiv which appar it was for the most case with most of the breakfast item i tried

i made my first and last round start at the omelet station the guy behind the counter took some time to make the omelet did it a littl careless howev it end up be the onli decent tast item i tried

most of the sausag link and patti i tri tast as if it was pick from the bottom of the barrel i tri some cheesi potato like casserol thing that look better than it tasted

th dessert item did not look appeal enough to tri thoughi had a bowl of some oatmeal fruiti dish with milk that was semi sweet and extrem tasty

th servic was nice and the place appear to be well kept howev the food has not entic me enough to want to give them anoth shot030610

i rare find myself in this part of phoenix so when i knew i was go to be in the area i had two place in mind for a late lunch  i was hope to dine at bobbi q but i found the price a bit too steep to dine alon so i head here

found the menu uninterest that day perhap bec i was look forward to good bbq fare but i final settl on the basic hummus and falafel  for those who care the falafel were fri in soybean oil  most place ive inquir at use corn and sometim peanut oil  the platter look veri appet but dont be fool  the hummus was veri bland and the falafel piec werent that great either  i had to ask for lemon to get some flavor out of the falafel and the hummus save grace was that it lent the falafel some lubric  the pita bread was probabl the best thing out of the whole meal and that not say much

afterward i check out the bakeri next door for some expens baklava  i chose three varieti and i found them all too heavi on soggi phyllo and lack in honey  

13 for terribl baklava and 7 or more on less than mediocr hummus and falafel made for such a disappoint adventur that day  i wouldnt recommend this to anyon  not even to anyon that didnt like me  but then again id never do that anywaynot bad but not great for the money spent 

i read a few review here on yelp befor and after i went to rao i had to confirm what i had read to be accur among the situat other yelper have list such as be told they are fulli book or that they they dont have a particular bottl wine due to the lower price of the bottl i can tell you both of these thing happen to myself and my parti 

we origin tri to make a reserv for 8 pm on a friday and were told there was absolut no way that would be possibl for 3 peopl the reservationist direct us to come in and sit at the bar if we like and we could wait for a tabl to open up for dine this is what we decid to do 

we stroll in just befor 8 pm to a crowd bar at rao my femal companion inquir at the door about a tabl for 3 we want to be thorough in case a cancel or someth of the sort had occur the young hostess assur us there was no way we would be seat in the dine room befor 930 pm we decid to go to the bar for a drink sit at the bar the room was fair full as i turn to look at the dine room i saw 7 empti tabl all clean prep and readi to go at 830 then 845 still no one sit in them close to 9 pm we are seat to a half empti dine room   

so we sit down and my one buddi has been here befor includ the one in new york he did the order of food i order wine figur the 3 of us would drink at least 2 bottl of wine throughout dinner we like wine i decid on a 80ish bottl of montepulciano the server came by to tell us that the wine was unavail and suggest a 95 dollar bottl instead i told him i would check the menu a bit and get back to him im not afraid of a 95 bottl of wine but the review i had read was ring in my ear so i decid on a 70ish bottl instead also unavail so when i decid to go to the 95 dollar bottl  they had it practic readi to pour haha it was almost comic 

the sommeli came by and was pour wine as the first cours of beet salad was arriv i was serv the salad to my friend and was told by the sommeli that i do that veri welli said thank i am in the servic industri also 

oh we didnt know you were servic industri too she said hmm whi doe that matter i thought

overal i have to tell you i was so unimpress with the whole situat that i just smile ate and order more wine i gotta say the food was realli unimpress my main gripe about american style italian food is the over abund of sauc and lack of flavor in a highend place like rao i would have expect that to be a nonissu not so realli bland sausag and broccoli rabe unflavor red sauc on a coupl of meatbal and realli just non exist on anyth over the top delici asid from the bottl of ripasso i had in place of dinner as i stop dine after a few bite just not good 

the bartend at the bar were veri nice smile and made a great martini it was a save bit to the even as they even smile and wish us good night as we left it was around 300 for the 3 of us and is probabl near averag per person price but far less than averag dine experi sorri better luck to you if you tri this out i wont be back for dinnerwe want to tri a new italian place in vega and sinc most caesar restaur have impress us we went with rao  big mistak  hundr of dollar later the onli nice thing i have to say about rao is that the servic was great and the ambianc is nice although christmasi  in august but everyth els  pass  

this is what we had 

capres salad  weird  the tomato were in huge quarter instead of slice and there was a pestogarlicbalsam sauc all over it  the chees was delici but the rest  not so much  

caesar salad  not bad but noth to write home about  

salsa alla marinara and a side of meatbal  my husband had this dish and didnt dislik it but didnt think it was anyth great either  i tri the meatbal in some marinara and im not go to liether was an acid ijustpukedinmymouth aftertast that i couldnt shake  needless to say ive had better meatbal  and sauc  

porcini mushroom risotto i realli thought this dish was go to blow my mind  the menu list it as  vialon rice cook with mushroom stock slice porcini mushroom parmesan chees and white truffl oil  what it actual is though is a differ stori  simultan mushi and hard rice with bland mushroom and an overwhelm truffl oil scent with a underwhelm truffl oil tast  the busboy knew i didnt like it and offer to tell my server but what is she go to do about it  she didnt make it  im just bum we paid 30 for a dish i took five bite of

overal the place has potenti the servic is great i mean a guy come out and dish your plate in front of you but it didnt do anyth for our wallet or our stomachwhen layer was in their old locat i would visit frequent for chocol chip cooki tarlet and the occasion birthday cake everyth was so delici ive been to the new locat a few time and it seem like they have lost their touch mayb the cozi of the former locat ad to the charm

on my first trip to the new locat my husband and i had breakfast i order a breakfast sandwich which was serv on layer version of a croissant i must say it was one of the oddest combin the croissant was not tradion fluffi but was over greasi and so flaki that it fell apart and left my finger drip of oil i could not even cut it with a knife it just made an even bigger mess after a few bite i start to think my tast bud were off becaus the flavor just did not jive when my husband tri it  he agre we realiz that sandwich had a horseradishlik spread yuck he also was not impress by his breakfast quich i find it a bit arrog that there was a comment made by layer manag that their flavor combin should not be question mayb they should listen to customers

th other issu i have is buss your own dish is awkward and inconveni especi when we spent over 20 on breakfast tip for manag sinc the place isnt that big and the food price are moder high  mayb you should bus the dishi could never pronounc the name of this place i dont even know what the fck a zoozacrack is i alway thought zoozacrack sound like a racist remark peopl would use in queen or the bronx or someth 

ive probabl come here onc everi year for the last 4 year i wrote a review about this place about a year ago but the filter ate it claim i was a worker here 

final want to figur out what a zoozacrack is so i googl it found no inform decid to break the word apart we all know what a cracker is but what the fck is a zooza well accord to googl a zooza is some dude who provid an individu legal proof that they are the owner of a horseor someth like that still i have no fcking clue what that is suppos to mean combin zoozahors licensur litig specialist guy with crackersaltin squar doesnt make a shred of sens but noth doe here the interior design look like either a david lynch movi or the room where debbi harri start rap in the 1981 mtv music video raptur i know ironi is the big thing these day but i dont fcking like ironi it suck the interior design can iron fck off

they got this burger that they pack with coleslaw thousand island and swiss chees it not bad it extrem messi though the rueben is also pretti good but i dont think there is one new yorker aliv that would say it can compar to carnegi weiss or greenberg delial here in lvhenderson 

the first time i ever came here was with my poker buddi in 2009 we had accumul about 15 of comp the bill came out to like 17 and the ladi at the counter waiv the extra 2 they had excel custom servic back then came back a few month later but this time they made us pay the balanc 

of cours they charg for everi littl thing ive been to kosher deli that would charg for a side of thousand island for my new york sky high so im not surpris actual i wont be surpris if they start charg for the water and the pickl soon

th first time i decid to eat here i ask multipl wynn worker the question where is zoozacrack locat none of them knew the answer most of them didnt know what the fck i was talk about one guy even told me that zoozacrack was locat at koval and flamingo when i final found the place i couldnt get in becaus in front of the entranc was antonio tarver he was piss drunk and have an argument with some chick who was dress like a stripper typic day in las vegai went here last night and was realli disappoint in the whole experi vis à vis the price and the surround  first it a beauti done restaur with a nice gas fireplac and eleg surround  that come with a fatal error  there is a glass wall that separ this love dine room from the bar and sever larg tvs all tune to basketbal  cant you put some drape on the glass and keep the dine room a dine room  one other thing it would be nice if you use real candl instead of those cheap plastic batteri oper one  good know your profit margin on each steak would allow that

a for the food it is veri overpr  total bill for 1 person befor tip was just under 80  that was for 1 ice tea a bowl of french onion soup an 8 ounc filet mignon a side of fingerl potato cook in duck fat with thyme and chocol bread pud  that it

th bread basket had a nice select with a slice each of oliv raisin and sourdough bread a pretzel roll and one lavash  the onion soup was standard  it wasnt a rich tast broth but standard  my server didnt understand blue so i said black and blue and then he respond with pittsburgh style and i said yes  the steak was more medium rare than extra rare as it should have been  the potato were much ado about littl  the bread pud was excel  servic was quit good with sever peopl see to more ice tea or check on my dinner

i recent had a 5 cours chef tast menu at a steakhous at a strip hotel and it was onli a few dollar more and it includ an 8 pounc american wagyu filet  i guess my expect for tbone were simpli too high  it just doesnt produc a meal that merit the price they charg  it a shame when you walk away from a pricey dinner and you rememb the bread basket and the dessert

i should have listen to hollii got drag here for a work outing by my cowork who think veri high of their bar and restaur choic in general like verg on snotti that should have been my first red flag learn that we would be sit outsid in the dead of the phoenix summer was the next who want to sit outsid sweat their ass off tri to make chitchat with the boss husband no thank you

now mind you i am much more of a bikini girl pbr in a plastic pitcher is okey dokey dandi onc in a while i like to get dress up and go suck down 12 martini that cool the vig is in nomansland a crappi part of town on the fring of the ghetto with pricey drink and food and a strang seeandbeseen atmospher that realli belong in old town it doesnt vibe with the whole have to park my car across the street next to the check cash place hope i dont get a ticket experi the decor ok noth to write home about again 12 martini and heel are fine if the place is smokin the vig is not it not even realli smolder despit the too cool for you attitud of the staff

no thank youg and i drive up and see the valet sign  2 realli you offer no onsit park except valet and you requir me to pay for it i will tip  i alway tip but actual charg a fee ugh so not classi that start thing off on the wrong foot 

g and i were the last to show up our group of 6 was seat at a tabl on the patio that was clear made for four five at the most i was smash between  two other  im all for be the peanut butter but this was absurd  i spent the meal dodg elbow tabl were too high or the seat was too low either way it made for an awkward and uncomfort dinner the staff had to notic the awkward arrang  i dont know how you could miss it 

anyway onto the food  well it was fine my caesar salad was fine as one might expect  it is pretti hard to screw up caesar salad g had the wing and the sauc was more bbqi than buffaloy the menu seem to be a bit pretenti word like deconstruct and dauphinois litter it the energi was realli realli strang yes it is a modern pub but i kind of expect more and yes the valet situat and the place creepi energi realli irk mewhile i can appreci the appeal of have a disinterest gay hipster server who is probabl realli good at bullshit about wine i found the overal ambianc and servic sort of off put  

the boyfriend and i wait a good ten minut befor someon came over to take our drink order though i notic the server eye our tabl long befor then  i imagin he thought perhap we were not in fact disinterest gay hipster who could bullshit about wine but rather lowend mesa kid tire of slum it at the local dive so we thought wed treat ourselv to someplac aw nice like the vig

except the vig is onli meh

th burger is worth it for five buck on monday the fri are awesom the drink special are mediocr the atmospher i found a bit stuffi and unfriend the menu is all over the place with no solid direct or theme and the total modern contempo art deco bullshit bathroom make me roll my eye while i pee

i got a coupl vodka soda and they were lack in the alcohol depart which is sort of the onli reason i order them  they were also serv in some stupid pretenti glass 

overal the experi seem dark mayb caus there were no window and sort of awkward and i found myself want to leav pretti quick  

i can appreci some hip littl loung where peopl go out to be seen and mayb pretend that the food is amaz but the vig is like the douch bag dude you see drive a bmw with his top down even though it 6 am and 20 degre outsid  i assum his account is overdrawn and his girlfriend say shes an artist but realli shes a server at oreganos

i think what it is though and i realiz this as i scof at the sparkl silver super modern sink fixtur in the woman bathroom with a door clever label with a giant w for women get it w is for women that most im just a stiff drinkscheapfoodsticki floorstoreupwaitress dive bar girl at heartmy first visit to this place wouldv been a 45 star rate but dure our most recent visit we were yank down the appreci custom platform by our heels

th even start off well we call from the road into vega from la and got an 11pm seat  we arriv just a coupl minut late and were greet warm by the hostess  we were told it would be a few minut and proceed to wait at the bar over cocktail  the bar was pretti empti and we were serv quick with great drink  bring a martini gal it import to start my night off with a good one 

the hostess came back told us to pay our bar tab and we would be seat  i was a littl surpris that a place like this wouldnt just add it onto our dinner bill but didnt worri  we paid cash the bar back came over to say thank and clear our area and we were on our way to a cozi littl nook in the restaurant

th lobster bisqu was a littl brothier than i would like but was still amaz  i like a littl richer cream but the flavor was excel and had lot of lobster chunk to munch on

th wedg salad was fresh and crisp the blue chees dress didnt realli tast veri blue chessi for peopl who realli like blue chees but was still spot on for what my tastebud were expecting

th bonein ribey came a littl under done but as rare meat lover it not worth send it back  onli an overdon steak would be ined blood and a cold center dont scare us black charcoal doe hee hee  the cream spinach was delish and help cook the under cook meat a littl more befor it hit my mouth  

savori flavor a good drink what more could one ask for  all in all a good night

until the bill came  no big deal our drink from the bar were on the bill  waiter came by no problem well take them off  flash forward to the bartend come to our tabl accus us of not pay our bill  the miniinterrog of whether we hand him the money or not was enough to kill the food and drink buzz we were revel in 

the waiter return said it was all fine but my husband still felt we deserv an apolog for be mistreat  the bartend return with an insincer im suppos to apolog or someth  and with that our nice dinner experi was ruin  the manag never came over the see to our issu  sad this steak hous is off our list of vega eatfood is waaaaaay overpr here simpl breakfast omlett toast misc item and dessertoops50sheesh

btw i did get thebil and paid for with mycashlolwe made a reserv for 830pm on april 12th  i figur it was good time prior to our jay leno show at 10pm  we were seat as we arriv  the hostess wish us happi anniversari which was nice of her  appar it show on their system when my husband made the reservation

w had a nice tabl and our waiter seem nice  we were surpris that an asianjapanes fusion restaur didnt have plum wine  that the most unusu thing ive ever heard of

w order sever small plate  grill asparagus chilean sea bass salad carpaccio salmon sashimi and coupl of roll  i made it clear that the rice portion of our meal will be from the sushi  everyth came slowli and after wait an hour for the sushi roll our waiter tell us it will be anoth 45 minut  realli  are you kid me  i cancel the sushi order and left still hungri  all the small meal that my husband and i share were too small for ani satisfact to happen

to think that it cost an arm and a leg to leav hungrypretti ridiculous

btwth 2 star are for the asparagus and sea bass  everyth els is worth nothing

hav not been this disappoint in a restaur in a veri long time

wil not be returni went here onli becaus we had a 90 off restaurantcom coupon and im glad i didnt actual pay full price the food was so mediocr that i determin that they dont put much effort into the food becaus they assum that the peopl eat here are alreadi so wast that they wont notic not a fanthere a reason whi harbor palac rank on the bottom of my list of dim sum place in vegas

it was my second visit ever and it just reconfirm my experi from the first time i went

saturday brunch  1130 am arriv  not as busi as i would expect  bad sign

w have a larg parti five adult and four children  as a result were seat in one of the larger tabl in the room set off to the right of the restaurant

w had bare sat down especi with get all the young kid seat when the cart ladi was holler you want dim sum  i was immedi put off with her attitud and probabl would have left if it was just the husband and i  my chines friend mention that her mom has a simpl standard of dim sum restaur  tea should be place on the tabl befor the food is brought out  and shes right  grow up that the first thing i rememb from my mani dim sum brunch  the waiter ask what kind of tea you want usual as your get situat and befor the cart come the tea is on your table

but in this case we felt so pressur to order from the ladi cart and had basket of food on our tabl way befor the beverag guy came around to ask what we want to drink  i will say that he brought the tea and water over quick and had our tea pot fill the whole time of cours with my help of flip the cover up  

we got the typic order of pork dumpl and shrimp dumpl  noth special here more dri out from oversteam if that make sens  we got a coupl order of beef ball and was surpris they didnt cut it in half ive alway seen it cut in half nor was ani worcestershir sauc given

ric noodl dish came by and i ask in cantones if they had beef noodl roll  she said they did look around then ask if i want the pork spare rib one  i said fine and then she ask about the shrimp one too which i said was fine  although she did tri sneak anoth one onto our tabl until we caught her in time to just say onli one  and of cours the beef one never show up  

i ask for egg custard bun and she said they had it but tri pass off some yellow bean one as well  we did eventu get the egg custard bun and it was not goodhard dri and old  bleh

deep fri chicken wing were decent the first time around but even better when we got them nice and hot  the deep fri salt and pepper shrimp was also nice and hot when we got it too

oth dish includ steam pork bun chow mein noodl chines broccoli been sit out too long shrimp and tofu chicken feet and steam beef tripe  noth memor though

th husband wasnt eat much from the veri start and i had to wonder whi  he discreet point to the hair that was sit on his rice noodl dish  oh yuck  and unfortun we did not say anyth about it then or at the end sinc we were with guest  but normal we would have at least tri to point it out after we paid  and no you never say anyth dure your meal becaus we all know what happen at chines restaur if you complain

overal harbor palac is just not that good we werent that impress the first time and we arent impress now  and the servic is beyond bad here  sure i know everyon say you cant expect much on servic at dim sum restaur but this place leav a bad tast in your mouth  it not even worth tolerating

they do have hot chili oil avail on the tabl not just regular chili sauc  and pleas stop ask for sriracha sauc you know who you areno thank stop in for a drink and dinner with a girlfriend on a weekend and was far from impress one star for the pretti view from the balconi and one star for the friend waitress beyond that everyth was disappoint we order an appet and a salad to share we had the sear ahi tuna medallion and the seafood salad the tuna was fine but not great for the price of almost 11 for a coupl of thin slice the seafood salad was pathet it had one tomato halv one egg halv shitton of lettuc and two shrimp on the top yes two shrimp for 1600 oh yeah it also had a scoop of imit crab on the side the drink were 500 which i thought was reason it was a sugar fill mess with no alcohol so i ask for a doubl shot in my drink she charg me for the price of two drinksso it was 10 strip price  for one drink in some below averag dump in middl of hendertucki the tab for one appet one salad and a coupl of drink was 61 befor tip never againwhat can you say about this place i was in the area in the middl of the day and thirsti i had never heard of the tilt kilt befor so i thought  an irish pub all right i went in  and thing were look great  nice interior lot of big screen tvs and good look waitress im a guy  i like look at good look scantili clad women

but it went downhil fast i wander over to the bar sat down and wait did i mention i was thirsti  it took a good 5 minut for the bartend to even notic i was there  she was busi talk to other custom on the outsid bar  she final notic me and hand me a menu and took my drink order never said a word  she then went back to her convers with the other 

while she was social i did look at the menu and the food peopl were eat and noth realli look or sound appet twenti minut later she came back and sharpli ask me if i want to order by that time i just want anoth beer befor i left she grumpili took the menu and went back to talk to the guy on the outsid bar

i did notic that out of about 20 peopl in the restaur all were men  obvious they were there to look at the waitress and not for the servic or food but all were sit at the bar or outsid patio  mayb the secret is to sit at a table

btw  the bartend never came back  she was so engross in her convers on the other side of the bar i could have walk out without pay and she never would have notic  i did leav cash for the drink  but no tip  

so if you want to dine and dash  this might be the place but otherwis dont botheri wait till my third visit to write a review on agav   go to agav is probabl like date a ditzi supermodel

embarass slow  
all three visit this last time we sat at 6 food arriv at 714  seriously

lack substanc     
entre are just ok def not worth the price  white corn chip are horrid stick to the blue ones
 

agav is a great spot to take someon for a drink you will score bonus point but eat somewher elsmy friend and i were in the mood for some indian cuisin 4 star on yelp is pretti good right unfortun the best thing that can be said about this place is it has a nice interior more upscal than your typic indian establish otherwis the food was decid mediocr and the servic was absolut atroci some of the worst ive experienc in a long time but let start from the beginning

on a big banner right outsid the restaur they advertis a 3cours dinner for two for 2999 upon inquir about this option our waiter inform us that special was no longer be offer and theyv been mean to take it down howev they did have a 5cours tast menu serv familystyl for 45 per person now either the waiter was bullshit us or their websit which advertis the same special is outofd as well either way this is what you call a classic bait and switch and fals advertis we should have taken the hint and walk out then but we were hungri unfortun this same thought would be a recur theme throughout the rest of the even so we ask what was includ in the 5cours tast menu and were not terribl excit by what we heard and it didnt seem worth anywher near 90 for the two of us we ask for a few more minut to perus the menu

aft about 5 minut we decid to get the sweet apricot and raisin naan 4 chicken tikka makhani 13 seven spice veal 25 babi eggplant 11 and 2 side dish of chana massala and aloo gobi 7 each oh and we had to pay anoth 3 for a singl order rice becaus none of the entre came with ani we end up wait anoth 15 minut befor anoth waiter spot us look a bit perturb and ask if we need anyth we told him we were readi to order i thought he was go to take our order but instead he just told our origin waiter that we were readi and would be right with us our waiter was run a coupl credit card with one of those portabl termin right at their tabl after the receipt was sign the waiter continu to idl chat with them for anoth 5 minut or so then our waiter disappear into the kitchen or god know where for anoth 10 minut befor final come to take our order he apolog for us wait a few minut yeah right tri half an hour i would be more understand if they were realli busi but less than 15 of the tabl were occupi i know i know we shouldv walk out already

so final our order is in but we wait and wait and we wait some more we continu to watch other custom who sat down after us and order after us get their food first and in one case actual pay the bill and leav at this point i am so incred green with envi of the custom who have the other waiter after about half an hour they final bring out all the food at onc at this point we were absolut raven but our spirit lift in the hope that it would be worth the wait

unfortun while the food satiat our hunger pang it was substandard indian fare the naan was not crispi at all but rather thick and gummi it didnt contain veri much apricot or raisin and no chutney tamarind mint or ani kind of condiment were offer the chicken makhani usual one of my favorit was kind of bland it lack the spici complex that a good curri should have the chicken didnt seem to be marin at all it was dri and was probabl cook separ and then toss into the curri at the end the aloo gobi was most potato and contain veri littl cauliflow we both got bite of undercook semiraw potato as well the chana massala veal and babi eggplant dish fare no better

dur this time no one stop by to ask how the food was nobodi offer to refil our near empti glass of water until we were readi to pay the check after ask for the check we wait over 15 minut befor our waiter return and was expect to collect the check when we explain that we still had not receiv the check he disappear for anoth 45 minut befor final return with our check we usual pay via credit card but decid that we better settl up in cash lest we want to spend anoth half an hour wait i almost never leav no tip but im think this is one of the rare situat that qualifi howev my friend lobbi hard to leav at least 10 as were walk back to our car a black crack whore tri to solicit us ah a fit end to such a memor evening

her the execut summari nice interior ambianc overpr mediocr food horrend servic i am sore tempt to give this 1star but sinc the food was at least edibl except for the undercook potato i suppos it just bare merit 2 star take my advic save your money and time dont do it just go somewher els like mount everest namast or samosa factoriit true  have grown up in california i love me some innout

it definit over hype but the food is consist delici they do the best job of lettuc wrap burger around make that anim style with my fri done extra crispi 

they pay and treat their employe much better than their industri counterpart which explain the fabul custom servic 

haha give me a break it almost non exist  at least at this locat recent 

see as this innout is by my offic it conveni and i use to come here often when i was a young dumb fool that thought it was ok to go out for lunch daili i never rememb have problem with my food or the employe 

drop in here last sunday to grab a 2 to go anim style protein style extra crispi fries

kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibl known that take my or anyon els order was a complet inconveni to her 

i ask twice to make sure she note protein style dirti look and a yes practic threw my card and receipt back at me 

when i look at my receipt i saw it wasnt list kevin call me up to grab my order and i ask if this was done protein style he said no but would happili remedi this 

usual four star for the food four star for kevin zero star for kayla 

i dont come here veri much but i will like stick to the innout on chandler and price from here on out when i decid to indulge

sorri for the two star rate innout but mayb you should consid remov this superbrat from a custom face posit or not hire these type all togeththe skinni soso sushi and incorrect cut sashimi 25 servic is shameless tri to upcharg you and ignor you when you dont feel like play along1 valu given the fact that ive been to korean sushi joint that serv similar product their outrag price do not match the qualiti of the food 2

mi hub and i came here about 2 year ago to sampl their valentin day omakas although there did appear to be a lot of cook item the qualiti of the food was enough to make us contempl come here again last week

w arriv with a friend for some good eat but were disappoint on mani levels

first of all the servic is high lack our waitress had the annoy habit of alway tri to get us to order more expens item on the menu no we do not want a miniscul bowl of edamam you want to charg 450 for when i can get a massiv bag of it for less than 2 no we do not want to order alcohol drink no we dont want ani of your appetizers

aft we kept polit declin her suggest she pretti much ignor us until she want to us to clear the bill which was frustrat becaus she didnt even bring out a bowl of rice that came with our meager meal not to mention that they remov our small plate when our food came out 

let me tell you it feel total ghetto eat out of their massiv sashimi bowl becaus you are like to drip soy sauc on the other piec of fish 

not cool not zen all ghetto sorri but it had to be said

enough about the shoddi servic more on the food

our friend and i order the sashimi special combin 2995 while the hubbi got the shin special plate 1995

for 1995 the onli special about shin special plate is how epic a rip it is although beauti present the fish textur lack the firm of realli fresh product the size of the fish on the nigri was also on the thinner side although the season of the various fish was vari the pair of flavor were onli okay in my book noth terribl innov and for 7 piec of nigri it is veri expensive

th sashimi special combin sashimi plate bowl of rice miso soup for 2995 is also veri expens for what it was the thin slice the small portion size left me veri disappoint top it off with fish that wasnt the finest qualiti i went on a thursday  no excus i cannot recommend this dish to anyone

overal it disappoint becaus there are veri few decent sushi joint in town but between the shoddi servic the lacklust fish qualiti and the skimpi portion this place get a 2 starlet me begin by say that i like this restaur design and roll i had were actual quit good  although i was at the sushi bar the waitress who serv drink and edamam was actual fantastic

whi onli 2 star then  funni you should ask

whil sit at the sushi bar watch one of the chef prepar someon els nigiri i happen to catch him proceed to throw the fish down on the prepar surfac to flatten it a coupl time and then some error in trajectori result in the 3rd throw land on the floor in front of him  he pick it up wash it off in the sink look right at me and then laid it neat across a rice ball  it went onto a plate with sever other and off to a tabl it went  call me crazi but there is no 5 second rule in restaur  wash it off doesnt chang that rule

so a few minut later while convers with my dinner partner the same chef who appear to be more tenur or the rank offici behind the sushi bar call out to the waitress behind us and scold her abrupt about a custom wait for a togo order  she happen to be direct behind me and not onli was it rude and inappropri to do so in front of custom but it total stop our dinner convers dead in it track  she respond that it was be taken care of and went about her busi  i think i just sat there with a dumbfound look on my face

suff to say there are mani excel sushi choic in las vega  i prefer one that take valu sanitari practic in prepar of the food and where the staff is a littl more pleasant to one another

thi will like be my first and last visit to this establishgrand cafe a grand price for mediocr food 

 i have to say that i was disappoint with the cream of mushroom soupspaghetti with meatbal and pepsi first off i believ with a strong convict that grand cafe ought to includ a soup of the day or salad with the meal this isnt the las vega strip and if the soup or salad is 3 i feel rip off consid that the cream of mushroom soup includ zero mushroom coincident this soup tast and look similar to the progresso cream of mushroom soup that was recent reintroduc to the las vega market a soup  that onc had mushroom in the broth fast forward to the spaghetti with meatbal it is imposs to ruin spaghetti but grand cafe came close with the meatbal it wasnt cold or anyth just below averag a signific portion of the plate was taken up by garlic bread in my opinion garlic bread is filler and the pepsi was too syrupy

  the servic was decent noth grand and noth negative

   the deal is that what i order at grand cafe was not worthi of 20 i could of dine in red lobster for that price if i do return i intend to stick to a sandwich with fri the bottom line is that station casino should bring back the valu of their old grand cafeim a top chef groupi ill own it i watch the show religi and when i get the chanc i will dine at top chef contest restaurants
  so when i heard that tom colicchio sandwich place was just a short walk from our hotel you better believ i went
  the name was cute and the sign kept remind me of wick  and it was big tom restaur so all sign indic that this would be a success oh how wrong i was
    i order the roast pork sandwich with red cabbag and mustard the pork was serious lack in flavor as was the cabbag a littl vinegarett would have help i even pick out a bone from the sandwichyuck for close to 10 for a sandwich i expect better especi sinc it own by a judg on top chef i also tri a peanut butter chocol cupcak becaus it my weak and it just didnt deliv at all disappoint all around inevit the meal was onli good for absorb the copious amount of alcohol id put into my bodi by that time in vega noth more

if padma were to tri the sandwich here im sure shed tell tom to pack his knive and go true storiwere my expect high come in here sure but it not like i was look for colicchio to get his shini head all sweati make me a sammi in the back i simpli thought theyd have an interest menu of overpr but delici wich wrong the menu is bore the sammi are small and as expect the price are high peep the pic of my slowroast pork press wich bleh i wouldnt be proud of that sammich if i made it in my own kitchen 

stumbl out of wet republ youll do just fine here for everyon els look elsewher for good eatsearch for a good greek place and discov that the fat greek is close on sunday we end up here 
 
there were not mani peopl in the restaur when we arriv  we order the saganaki flame chees as an appet  they do the opa thing when they set it on fire which is cute  but it was just like eat a block of slight warm chees  i guess i expect it to melt more
 
i got the moussaka and my husband got the gyro plate  the moussaka was pretti good  the potato that came with each dish were excel  nice cook with a lemon sauc  the gyro were a littl dri  the gyro plate come with pita but it buri under the gyro which i found kind of odd
 
the main issu came up when we tri to get the check  a group of six men came in dure our meal  the manag fawn all over them  and then we could not get the time of day from ani of the server or the manag for a good 20 minut  there were onli 4 tabl total seat in the whole restaur  the check is not that difficult is it mediocr greek food and easili distract servicthis restaur border on that precious fine line between hole in the wall and dump the park lot was atroci  pothol uneven pavement and rock all over the place  we decid to give it a tri after lock our door and take all of our valuabl out of the car 

to our surpris the manag the young woman with the short hair was welcom and ask us to sit wherev we like  there was no hosthostess stand so the respons of seat fell on whoever was up front  we sat near the restroom which was a mistak for sever reason first our parti of 5 was around two uneven tabl that were push togeth the tabl were miss paint and had scratch throughout in addit the smell of urin from the bathroom crept around the corner and hover around us dure our entir meal
 
on a posit note the chip and salsa were veri good el torito manag to limit the spice level for those that cant handl the heat but still deliv on flavor howev the entre that follow were not that great i chose the chile verd dinner with rice and bean the pork was shred and was swim in greas the dish itself tast okbut the greas start overtak my rice and bean speak of rice it was on point there was no sign of veget in the rice but it was fluffi and season perfect  on the other hand the bean were a mess i have tast better bean out of that rosarita can  dont tri and fool me by slop cheddar chees over the topthey were still horribl 

mi wife order the tacquito ewwwwww  i took a bit of that chicken tacquito and immedi spit it out  gross  

if the food was better i would call guy fieri and let him know that i found a dive worth check out  howev i am lean more toward shut this eye sore down and head the other wayinto las vega for authent mexican food  

btwthey do not make their own tortilla here that just bad busi im usual down for red robin as i love a good burger but my recent visit to this locat had me run for the door

r robin is great spot for some pretti decent burger and chicken sandwich the bright color and décor scream famili friend and they definit go out of their way to pleas young children the tv in the floor is cool touch on an averag visit you will hear their rendit of the birthday song sever time fortun there is a full bar and good happi hour for the grownup 

it had been a while sinc the last time i was here so i convinc some friend to check it out around lunch time we were prompt seat by the host and greet by our server littl did we know that this was go to be the last time we saw her i decid to get my usual the peppercorn burger and onion ring to share after we made our select we wait for our server to return and wait and wait and waited

about 20minut later one of the busser came over look confus and ask if someon had help us he act like we had just taken menus from the front and just sat down random soon after a new server appear for whatev reason she seem annoy that we were there as if we had done someth wrong for whatev reason our food came out in wave after the onion ring i was the first to get my food we were expect the other two dish to come our soon but they took almost 30 minut my friend who order the bruschetta chicken sandwich was brought out the fish and chip instead i have no idea who they mix that up they brought out her correct order later but our other friend and i were long finish with our food my request for an addit serv of the bottomless fri also seem to have been quick forgotten as well

 not sure what we did to deserv the neglect but it suckthis place is not that great but it deliv so i have order from here a few time 

the pad see ew is pretti good  i also like the pinappl fri rice  it well spice but not over spice  

ive gotten the panang curri a few time and it has been hit or miss rang from decent to bad  sometim it just overload with sugar  the tom ka gai is ok but there are larg piec of galang and ginger that you need to pick out everi bite

mi fav thai in town is lotus of siam  httptinyurlcoml8hr9w   and if i dont feel like drive clear across town archi or pin kao are decent enoughonli peopl in there were the worker creepi 

the first worker i saw was skate on this thing that was similar to a skateboard but wasnt and juggl bowl ball pin his whole steez vivid remind me of jp from grandma boy creepi 

where is big piano

wher is all the mattel 

i dont know if it was the cid but all i can say is creepii realli want to like this place i did i like the atmospher when i walk in clean sleek and fair modern i sat at the sushi bar becaus in my opinion that the onli way to realli experi a sushi restaur it all about the technician push out the sushi behind the counter

now a quick disclaim my mother was born and rais in japan so i am a bit of a sushi snob but i dont think that make me unreasonablelet me explain 

for me sushi is about two thing season rice and fish in japan top sushi chef creat their own blend of rice to achiev in their opinion the perfect textur and flavor the season vinegar they use is a close guard secret along with the aforement rice blend becaus in japan anyon can get great fish so the season rice will make or break you 

at lahaina grill the rice is mediocr at best it is underseason with the season itself lend no complex to the rice the rice textur was simultan over cook and undercook now im no expert on the actual execut of sushi but my educ guess is that theyr not vigil when cool off and or season their rice which usual involv flip and spread the grain in a wooden shallow hot tub look thing a techniqu that is an art form in itself 

and pleas dont misunderstand me im not expect to get authent hokkaido or kyushu sushi in las vega i realli am a reason person but realli you need to take pride in your rice and your fish which lead me to my second point

im a comput geek for a live so pleas take this with a grain of salt but if i were a sushi chef i would be embarrass to display your fish in my sushi case the worst offens by far is your pink ahi which to a lamen is fine becaus it bright and doesnt tast like anyth to someon who know sushi your ahi should be dark red at best qualiti and actual tast like ahi the pink color is produc by low grade tuna be cold smoke by carbon monoxid which honest isnt as bad as it sound but this process ultim lead to a beauti speci of fish that after process tast like noth you may be abl to fool the averag person who doesnt like the true flavor of raw fish but i wasnt fooled

now that ive gotten that off my chest let me tell you whi i feel guilti give this place onli two stars

th servic was awesom and couldnt have been friendlier the guy at the sushi bar was veri nice and he seem to have a true passion for what he was do although i think he lack the knowledg requir to be a great sushi chef the issu at this restaur stem from a lack of leadership i think the employe here general want to do a great job they just lack the train and tool to make that happen

with that said i will be back becaus the employe are general veri pleasant and i like the decor it will be at least 6 month befor i return becaus i want to give the owner and manag time to evolv i believ this place has potenti and can grow into someth veri special with just a few tweak and a finer eye for detail

i onli hope it can evolv into it true potentidisclaimer
ther is no food review here our experi was bad enough that we didnt even eat here  it seem pretti consist with other review that this place is pretti bipolar with their servic  it a shame becaus their food seem to come high rated
end disclaimer

so after want to come here for a while now some friend and i were final abl to get in

th first thing we notic upon walk in was the strong bleach smell in the littl are by the hostess stand we stood there for a coupl minut and the smell bother me to the point of actual sneez we were final seat after someon seem to notic we were stand there 

upon be seat we were given your standard issu sushi order sheet and some menus here where the proverbi crap hit the fan their menu is compris of item name onli with no descript at all this wouldnt normal be a problem if half the item werent given japanes name we wait 10 minut befor we were serv drink by not our server and she walk away 5 minut later she came back and ask if we were readi and we said we were have troubl deciph the menu and she said ok and walk off instead of see if we need help with someth when she came back 5 minut later i ask if they had someth that describ the menu item and she said yes and went and got a bowl of sand with littl clip hold busi card that held sushi descript  and then left again  they were for the 5 most expens sushi roll they had 

final she came back after a few minut and we start to ask her about what stuff was she answer some question and then my vegetarian friend ask her about vegetarian choic other than the 3 thing list she immedi recommend 2 item with bacon in the name to our friend horror and then couldnt answer what sauc had fish in them as their menu had note that some do  she then left us yet again to make a choic  we decid for our friend own peac of mind and my alreadi annoy attitud that we should probabl just go eat at eastwind where we knew they had awesom sushi servic and prices

now some might argu that it our own fault that we arent super sushi veteran and should alreadi know what we are order but it my philosophi that you dont have to be an expert on someth to enjoy it  especi not food  

i hate to give this place this low of a rate without even tri the food but to wast a half hour or so befor even realli get to the point where we could have had food be prepar is ridicul  on top of the fact that the waitress didnt seem too keen to help us figur out what the heck we were even ordera recent trip with my husband to yasu  last saturday night began with be ignor follow by more ignor and end with be ignor as we left i was not even wear my cloak of invisibility

w wait at the hostess stand for five minut befor be greet even though the hostess made sever trip to the podium without ani acknowledg and were then direct to the bar where we sat anoth five minut without be greet or offer a beverag we did howev stare at the bartend while he ate someth and ignor us

w went to roka akori went here tonight with the bf we thought it was realli meh capit meh we had a reserv but for some reason got sat insid there were virtual no peopl eat insid and outsid was live and had a band play we couldnt even hear it insid it was like silent i would think they would at least open the door but nope so that was a bad start it took our waitress a long time to even come to our tabl and when she came she ask if we want drink and app which we didnt given the portion size and we order dinner the waitress seem kind of short with us and it may have been that she was busi or that she was mad we didnt order more item anyway so i order the chicken and the bf order the pull pork both were pretti lack luster first off the food came out realli fast like it was all premad fast and it wasnt realli hot just kind of warm like other peopl have said the chicken sound realli good but actual come out kind of bland the menu say the chicken is pound but my chicken was like 2 inch thick so that was weird the bread wasnt realli crispi and the whole thing just wasnt that good the bfs pork was also kind of bland even with the dip sauc that came with it the side were alright mash potato corn bread carrotsthes didnt have a ton of flavor despit the food be underwhelm we did decid to order dessert this is whi i gave this restaur 2 star the banana burrito was delici i wish i had just eaten this for dinner 
so we get our check and i have a 30 groupon the bill come back and onli 20 was taken off we wait for about 6 minut for the waitress to come back and she was good about it she fix it it just seem like a weird mistak anyway for the two of us to get main and split a dessert no app and no drink cost me a total of 45 would have been 60 this was way too much for what we got i felt kind of rip off mayb it was just my experi but it was overal underwhelmi found the servic here attent and time but have to share some sentiment with other unimpress yelper about the mediocr of the dine experi i was introduc to fuego bistro by my roommat who had purchas a groupon without know anyth about the restaurant

it has a charm vibe it off the beaten path in a quirki courtyard border by a salon and danc studio but the food was unremark not by ani mean ined but rather forgett i felt the restaur concept was a littl confus given the choic of side which dont necessarili pair well with everi entre i had the sear ahi tuna which was top with a balsam reduct and a mangor pepperavocado salsa it was cook proper but underseason except for the balsam reduct which was noth but sweet perhap the bland of this dish could be remedi with chili and lime and salt but regardless it did not deliv on tast i chose to have the chipotl cheddar mash potato and saute green bean as side dish the green bean were the best of the two simpl and tender but the potato were lack in flavor chipotl was onli hint at and the chees was entir underst i know there has to be a way to elev this food but fuego has fallen short 

mi roommat was in agreement that the meal was not a hit even the key lime pie for dessert did not make the grade i see potenti in this restaur sinc the staff is friend and help but ultim it about the food and i cant recommend it the onli save grace was that we did not pay full pricethis place is mediocr at best as there are a varieti of other restaur in the valley that are latin influenc and might i add a hell of a lot cheaper and shame on you guy for charg those ridicul price when your food isnt up to par order the empanada and it was a complet let down the meat was just a soggi mess and the sauc did not compliment the dish at all i was afraid to order anyth els so i just stuck with that anoth thing that was a let down was the margarita i order who ever was the bartend come on ani bartend know not to add regular tabl salt to the rim it just doesnt sit well and make for a terribl drink i will say that the staff was more than great and super friend mayb and hope in the near futur when you revamp the menu or lower your price id be will to give you guy anoth trianoth phoenix restaur get away w poor custom servic subpar food high price and a horribl host

reservationsi made reserv for my boyfriend sister birthday last night 92413 she had a groupon and weve both been want to tri out this restaur for a while i call to make reserv no one answer dure open hour i call again no answer i went onlin and found a number to text your reserv i got a respons back veri quick got it 
when we arriv we were seat at the tabl near in the entranc hallway probabl the worst tabl peopl from the danc studio were sweep the dust and dirt from the danc floor out their back door right next to our tablegross no one mention the birthday the whole dinner clear a lack of communic w the reserv line
th worst part was when i mention our disappoint w our experi to the xl host at the front he was not empathet in the slightest way i made a comment about have a groupon and the host use it against me say well that the type of servic you get when you use a grouponoh realli i couldnt believ he said that our servic was actual good it was him that was dread to communic with
i mention someth about the birthday and he said we dont do anyth special for birthday i ask if they knew how to at least say happi birthday and he snide said well happi birthday  i told him it wasnt my birthday it was someon els in our group
a group of peopl came up and he chang his attent to help them so i walk away he then yell at me to come back that he wasnt done talk i me i was done talk to him when he chang his focus to the other grouph clear has no custom servic skills

foodth onli thing they have right is tast total lack of attent to textur food come out of the kitchen sloppi overcook carrot undercook cornbread cornbread was sit in a puddl of juic from the carrot when i got my plate make it extra soggi empanada were fantast pull pork was good noth special steak had lot of tendonscartilag top on the steak was great great classic margarita

i will not be go back not worth the moneythis pizza is lame  i should have gone with my instinct that a downtown pizza by the slice pizza joint shouldnt be complet empti at 1130am on a weekday and gone somewher els but i didnt  

the place was complet empti and it still took them 12 minut to get me my two slice which were huge  

i hate to say it but the pizza complet suck  the crust was so rubberi that i couldnt pick up the slice without it flop over  

for two slice and a coke i paid near 8 but i wouldnt have paid 2 for that food  i forc myself to eat one slice and then threw out the other

yuckfour star average
why
thi place is a chain restaur with a silli name  the famili made me eat here and i will tell you this  the onli thing four star here are the sexi tall young fit waiter everyth els is weak and salty

at least they serv bourbon  but serious the cocktail menu was silli and the prepar by the untrain bartend was obvious  silli roll with honey butter oh that cute 

the food was applebe meet outback   one of those tast of the world menus  my dad was silli enough to order the prime rib  it look like a swanson frozen dinner  poor dad  it is call white chocol grill  what doe that mean  oh it mean we are silli and have dupe peopl into think we are a trendi restaurant

so sad  serious the servic is love and attent the food is better prepar and home with more flavor and less salt  i guess the real french fri  the string kind were yummi but i need to up my bp meds

oh and a funni decor thing  they use roll up stack utensil in napkin as sorta sculptur decor around the restaur  sorta weirdstop here for a few munchi after watch ka and befor hit the club 

we sat at the edg of the bar  not shock got a lot of attent from those stop by just for a drink after much debat we ask the bartend for rec we got the pepperoni oliv pizza  steak skewer 

the pepperoni was housemad but it may as well not have been becaus i couldnt tast the differ it was over a bit too salti mayb they shouldv taken into account the salti of the top befor season 

the steak skewer were tender but the slaw wasnt dress enough the present was nice though

servic was prompt  the bartend was friendly

i would onli go back for the peopl watch  random funni attenthave you ever succumb to peer pressur onli to experi major wave of regret later  like that time you didnt want to wingwoman for your girlfriend becaus you had ill intuit about the friend of the guy she like  this is wolfgang puck bar  grill  it bear a famous chef name and live insid a famous casino yet is emptier in content than a stripper convers after the lap dance

our outoftown friend want to visit wolfgang puck i hadnt been there for more than a year and had no recollect of what i ate on my last visit but outoftown friend often get to make the decis so i suffer anoth forgett experi at wolfgang puck  we had the pink ladi appl  pear salad which was okay if not a littl drench in dress  then after our order of sea bass was reject becaus the kitchen didnt get the fish that day we got the organ chicken  it was serv on top of mash potato with roast carrot  carrot were undercook potato and chicken were all right noth to make an impress  

fifti dollar for a meal i would pay around fifteen dollar  the latter probabl would have a more authent atmospher not a generic view of mgm tourist  this is what wrong with vega a fraudul copi to overcompens for soulless commercithis is the place you go insid the luxuri venetian hotel on the las vega strip when you are

1 broke after lose all of your money gambling
2 dont want to spend 50person for lunch in a finer venetian restaurant
3 want a sandwich that cost less than 10
4 in a hurry
5 want a snack befor you get into your car in the park lot
6 is the last money you will lay down in sin citi befor you leave
7 all of the above

th rialto deli is insid the food court on the main floor of the venetian hotel near the escal go up to the park lots

so it make sens that you stop here for a cheap bite befor you leav sin city

you know all of those beauti luxuri hotel like the venetian with all of their glitz glam and amen werent built off the win of the visit gambler 

nope 

to support that type of luxuri found on the strip you need a lot of loser will to give it up over and over againmy wife and i had reserv there last night  poor choic not a bad place to eat but a terribl dine experi 

park was an issu despit our earli reserv the onli park avail was in the next lot over one had to travers an earthen embank and a grubbi alley to get to the place tell your companion to wear someth other than high heels

i dislik place that serv oliv oil in place of butter with one bread i know it fashion but it give an impress of economi that fine for macaroni italian grill but detract from the tone of a place with tarbel pretens id prefer it if theyd serv both or at least give one a choic 

the soup of the day potato and leek was of delic flavor but redol of potato bud could it be possibl that theyr make this stuff out of a dehydr product the caesar salad starter was a nonent and might have been improv by a littl ground pepper which wasnt offer 

mi bride was mightili impress by the grill salmonsom of the best shed ever had she said the effect was somewhat dissip by the peculiar potato product offer as a side if you like to peel off and eat the crust around the edg of a pan just use to bake scallop potato au gratin youll like this stuff 

i had the pork chop which was veri good without be memor it serv with a side of what they claim to be wild boar bacon and unidentifi green the pork independ was bland and without much charact but spear a bit of pork add to the end of your fork a fragment of bacon and then a green or two and the dish is much improv 

dessert was uninterest the sorbet was of the store bought varietyand not top shelf stuff eitherand the appl tart was bland and as dri as if it been left in the oven overlong 

the ambianc of the place leav a lot to be desir for a celebratori experi it might work for a busi meet but it aint no place id care to take a date ever again the dine room is crowd and noisi make convers difficult and at time imposs the tabl are too close togeth and i had to endur a face full of server butt whenev he wait on or clear the dish of the folk at the tabl neighbor our 

i suppos ive save the bestor the worstfor last i havent been as rush by the waitstaff at a meal sinc my experi in an armi mess hall at ft bragg north carolina the place is be run as a money make machin and that mean that they are tri to turn over tabl as mani time as possibl in an even servic is over rapid and one feel pressur to finish up and allow the waitstaff to get the next cours on the tabl the object of cours is to get you fed and out the door free up a tabl for anoth parti my wife resort to the tactic of pick up her fork when she saw the busguy approachingotherwis hed be on us to clear the plate contain food over which we were tarri in his opinion overlong

th check was present to us the moment it was ascertain that we had complet dessert but befor the plate had been clear i return it ask that she bring it on after wed finish our coffe which by the way hadnt been offer either 

to his credit the dine room manag did come over to apolog for rush us and comp our coffe he explain that the standard in america is to present the bill when dessert had been finish i beg your pardon not in ani place ive ever dine and i was born in ohio

thi place seem popular enough on a saturday night but i certain wont be grace it dine room ani time soon at this price point 175 includ wine and tip for the two of us i expect more than what was offer 

sorri folk i know this sound like a rant and to some extent it is it was an import even for usaft all twenti year onli come onc in a marriag well most marriag anyway and we had hope for a gentler experithis place is noth to write home about  hidden away in a corner of the shop mall near decatur and sahara one would almost miss it if they werent alreadi tri to track it down  as the restaur is onli open till 2pm if you take too long to find it you wont make it in time

when we enter the restaur we found our tabl and the waitress drop off the menus without ask us if wed like someth to drink  this would be understand if it was slam in the restaur  we were one of two or three tabl occupi howev so this with the fact that it took her anoth 1015 minut to return diminish our hope of an enjoy meal

i am one to believ that a restaur should not be entir judg on one particular meal alon  much like lotus of siam where it is said the northern menu is what the restaur is best known for the hash here is suppos to be excel  i howev am not a big fan of hash so i chose to not eat it as well it was lunch  the food that we did order the peasant lunch was my choic was decent but again a bowl of chili plain toast and a small cup of strawberri and banana did not seem to be worth 699

between the two hash hous monik i would recommend agogo  forget about the look of either placeat agogo the food is better all around i dont have to limit myself to one particular type of food and the portion are huge  if i want a small decent cook homemad meal ill go to the 50s diner on jone near the 215 or black bear diner on jone and tropicana  both are much more appropri choic with better servic and decent foodi dont get the buzz about this place on my visit all three scoop i had stracciatella hazel nut and pistachio were ici and lack ani sort of flavor punch ya know how can you fuck up the classic right plus the guy behind the counter look more interest in text than scoop 

mayb i was there on an off night it was toward close time perhap the gelato was a bit on the old side ill tri again at some pointif you have money to wast on mediocr food  servic this is the spot for youokaymi past experi with farmer market complet overshadow my opinion about the downtown phoenix public market  the context i use to work at an organ orchard in the central valley of ca that sold 43 varieti of peach and grew acr of fresh basil oregano thyme rosemari  after the orchard i move to the bay area where there is a farmer market everyday

i am give the phoenix public market a harsh two star for all the reason given by previous yelper  yeahth item are expens even after chip in for the organ local small busi factor  the qualiti is not consist  i bought two head of garlic half of one was dri out and unus the other sproutingth same goe for the onion  

i like the scone that i bought from the bakeri stand  the scone had a sandi textur and was moist and fresh

i havent been back in a while and will probabl give it anoth or sever chancesth onli way it will get better is to support it and encourag it

mi rec is to go earli on sat have a scone and coffe and peopl watch in between read articl from your favorit weekend paperafter read about the phoenix public market on here and on various websit i knew i had to check it out  but when i got there i was serious underwhelm  where was the produc  where were the farmer 

i guess ive been spoil by farmer market in san francisco and in hawaii but i dont think even a quarter of the booth were hawk fresh produc even the tini market in flagstaff has more i was expect bounti of tomato squash and other delici veggi  ala there was littl varieti in the way of produc  

most of the thing sold there seem to be valuead food or process food like decio pasta which while delici can be order off a websit or at other market  they also had bake good prepar food like tamal italian food but sinc i was shop to make a meal for a vegan friend noth there realli was usecame up for the week wednesday even event to see how it is  there were sever food truck and a few stall vendor  although i did enjoy a big cajun burrito from the jamburrito truck i found the event overal to be kind of a disappoint  there was a guy play guitar along with a soundtrack  a fair number of peopl out for the event but i thought it was weak overal     serrano is to mexican food as friday is to american food

that is to say bean and rice are to french fri as corona is to budweiser

what i mean is chimichanga is to cheeseburg as salsa and chip is to bread and butter

so you have quesadilla to pizza as margarita to cosmopolitan

in summari two star is to restaur rate as die hard is to movi  

itll get the job done but it wont be memor or soon repeati rememb when they first open year ago and i like this place theyv expand and remodel the place along with that was a declin in the qualiti of their food my friend and i share a medium half everyth half pepperoni pizza and rainbow cooki 

pizza
what the heck happen to their crust it was like eat a cracker  pale and flavorless what the heck happen to the pizza it just not as good as the last time ive been here i had to fix it by dous it with hot sauc 25

rainbow cookies
when i think of rainbow i think happi thought i tri their rainbow cooki and i was hope my trip to new york was soon enough so i can get the real deal this brought me great disappoint it was dri and tast so artifici never again will i tri rainbow cooki from this town if it not from bagel cafe 15i was intrigu by all this talk of the salad room i had to check it for myself

i thought the interior atmospher was quit nice a littl date but nice

i decid i would tri the salad room see pics
whil i was impress with the salad room itself the content were most thing i wouldnt  care to eat not even sure what some of the stuff was
 i onli made one trip and ate onli half of that and the littl debbi pinwheel wasnt one of them

everyth look and tast too institut if you know what i mean 

 mayb you dont

ok how about look around and see waiter come out of the kitchen serv plate with those plastic lid over themthey realli didi just got taken back to the convalesc home i use to visit my great grandmoth in dure dinner hourblech never seen those lid use in a restaurant

i realli just got gross out while eat there mayb it was the guy next to me me have the all you can eat fish and chip with his littl jar and spoon of cocktail sauc that was serv to someon els after he left i dont know but i do know i wont be go backthis place alway smell like geriatr the green wall paper doesnt help with that ambianc either dont forget to note the brass light fixtures

for some reason my famili love this place and im alway forc to go for birthday or whatev i person dont get it the food is pretti nasti everyth i have ever had here remind me of the mari calendar frozen dinnersexcept that mari calendar frozen dinner tast better and are price to match the qualiti of food 

the servic is mediocr i guess 

they have a salad bar which also has a few other option but all nasti again noth gross me out more than plastic bowl fill with cold and cheap ranch 

and not to be mean or anyth but the peopl who dine here gross me out there are certain age of peopl who just gross me out when they eat infant3 yrs old and then it start again somewher around age 80death i love old peopl and babi but i hate watch them eat or think about their hand be anywher near food that i have to eat  

this place just isnt for me i guess i will say that my step dad think the bread pud is to die for keep in mind hes in the same age rang as most of the diner here so take from it what you willim go to give skeptic chymist 2 star to averag out my recent 4 star visit and my 2 recent 2 star ones


i realli want to like skeptic 
they have everyth i like  their food is veri good and well price they have excel special and a huge and thought craft beer menu plus it just a cool local one of a kind place

what the problem  hostility

it a coin toss as to how youll be treat  ive been there probabl 10 time  one time it great and next time your treat like an unwelcom intruder

last night was the latter  

the waitress clear did not want to be there  she convey agit from the first moment she approach our tabl  she mumbl slouch and shuffl  

we express an interest in the red hook beer on special  she gestur toward a poster on the wall clear intend that we get up go read the poster and not troubl her by ask her to verbal what red hook beer they have  

she left we walk over to read the poster and order our select 
 were out of all red hook beer she then inform us 
 
she impati demand our plan b beer select  my wife was read the beer menu  the waitress ask me what beer i want  
i said  im wait my turn to see the list 

she let out a sigh of contempt and just walk away

monday is 5 cheeseburg which is a fantast deal  my son order one
a i order mine she bark over me as i spoke

il have to charg you for the water

what 

im go to charg you for water  

whi are you go to charg for a glass of water 

becaus you have to order a drink for that deal and he gestur toward my son onli has water

what a veri charm diplomat you are miss 
hell have a coke thank you so much for asking

th food was good but again the waitress just had this impati i hate everyon attitud the whole time 
 
later we ask can we order more beer befor happi hour end  she just say yes and keep walk  

we look at the board read the menu and care select which beer we want  
she show up with 2 glass of what we had order at first  

i said what are these

w didnt want those again we want someth different

oh and left them anyway sigh again and walk away 

end of discussion

no sorry
no what did you want 
no anyth  just oh as in i will put that on my list of thing about which i do not care

interest she disappear 34 of the way though the servic and someon els took over

expect good food and a theoret good beer select but do not expect good servic becaus this is not the first time the levelofservicecoin toss land tail upi would rather go to benihana to be honest i have been here a few time becaus it so conveni but has never been worth it in the end i have eaten here and had dinner to go it alway take forev and it is not cheap i expect cheaper if there no atmospher or realli good food would make up for it i have not gotten sick from the sushi here but let just say i didnt feel so hot after eat here the last time i looooov sushi and it hard to say that i wont be back here but id rather drive a bit farther and skip run the riskthe weird of this place begin befor you even get out of your car when you are confront with park reserv for pregnant women onli  then when you enter you discov a huge restaur with no custom  at least that was the case when i was there on this tuesday at about 1115 am  

to the right of the entranc there was a counter with an older woman pugzi stand there behind it  it look like where you pay but it isnt  instead you pay when you order at anoth counter way down a wide aisl to the left that has enough line row rope off for the entranc to the state fair

i order today special which was a pastrami sandwich  it come onli one way on fresh but strang swir bread that has veri dark mix with what i suppos is whole wheat  some rye seed in it  for the special you also get a pickl spear  a small cup of notverygood macaroni salad  a small mint for dessert  the pastrami serv was ok about 1 at the highest point taper down to zero at the edg of the bread  that not generous but pugzi here isnt as expens as scott or chompi either

anoth review complain that they thought the restaur look dirti  it look veri clean to me  there is a pretti courtyard outsid with comfort look tabl  chair for those who enjoy eat outside

th price for this tuesday special was a reason 650  i went back  forth on whether to give the place 2 or 3 star  i didnt enjoy it enough to return for anoth visit so ill settl in at 2  i guess ill never know whi in the world that woman is stand there  weird place     oumm no  yelp fail  i feel bad for take my friend here  sure i should know better than order steak and egg ever but this was at best a mediocr rendit of the breakfast classic  i have had better biscuit at popey this isnt to denigr popey but rather to note that if you cant beat lowend nation chain then you probabl havent reach a threshold bar to a three star review  by far the most enjoy part of the meal were the overs drink  while one of my friend foolish order an absurd sugari pina colada our bloodi mari were decid averag  here that is a good thing  unless you are look for super cheap food i wouldnt recommend the trek over hereiguana mack can be a great realiti check if anyth it will remind you how suburbanit in the rest of the countri get down take ani theme tropic bar ala rainforest cafe that you might find in bakersfield or indianapoli and throw in a dancefloor and some buck hunter  and ta da  you have iguana macks

w found ourselv here after a cornhol tournament die down a few neighborhood away this place is quit the mob scene on weekend and feel as if half of the singl in gilbert and chandler are up in here wear their even best  whether it be from wet seal for the ladi or guy sport blackwhit cap over their brow ensembl from tapout 

so you have a few choices
 tri to engag in some mindnumb small talk with the regulars
 be among the first becaus no one els in the club is drunk enough on the dancefloor to the local band do mid90 alt rock covers
 or hide in the corner with your friend and avoid everyon while sharpen your buck hunter skills

w tri those three option in exact that order until we couldnt take it anymorpet peev 1  when yelper give an establish a bad review base sole on servic issu alon without stay to eat if you didnt even eat the food then are you realli entitl to write a scath review 

know thisim about to piss myself off and break my own rulebecaus im go to do the exact thing i hate as describ abov damn me 

mi brother and i went out on a week night a while ago for some revers happi hour grub and just so happen to cruis by this place upon see the ubercool iguana wear sunglass on the sign which instant remind me of those cool 80s izod shirt we knew we had to stop sad upon enter the place just had this grimi look and feel to it the kind of feel you get when you stop at a dairi queen in some one hors town on the way to vega the experi that follow is summar below 

we park and enter the front door 
there is no hostess or visibl employe anywher 
we wait for a few minut tri to figur out what to do 
still no employe aroundw wander the whole placeand to our shock do not find a singl waiterwaitresshostessbartendercook anywher 
we go back to the front room stand there confus about what we should do 
wait five minut 
walk around againstil not a singl employe of iguana mack to be found anywher 
leav to find a better establishmentin this caseapplebe which is say a lot becaus i hate applebe 

can someon explain how a restaurantbar like this can be devoid of anyal employe around 10 oclock i was tempt to go and ask one of the inebri bar patron but it just didnt seem worth the hassl i would have like to tri iguana mack but sad wasnt given the chanc it shouldnt be a challeng to eat somewherean establish should be court you for your busi and this was the complet opposit 

now the bigger question is thiswher were the employe some of my theori 

an all at onc employe weed smoke break 
they were transport to an altern timelin and are now live in a parallel univers where they work for a classier restaur kind of like lost for wait staff 
employe orgi 

eh who knowsbut im just not too jazz about go back to tri this place it left a bad tast in my mouth and i didnt even have ani of the food that say somethnot my favorit spot it look promis walk in there was live music but too loud so decid to eat insid each food and drink  item we order was disappoint this includ wing and some kind of asian taco and a hand of mix drink  servic was pretti bad as well our initi server never came back to check on us after our order was taken  we  had to flag down other server walk by each time we want someth probabl wont be back anytim sooncapo is a place concern with the experi when you walk in the front door you enter in a littl vestibul area with no window no doorknob that work and a camera in the corner a littl screen slide open and the guy ask you what you want kinda like a speakeasi when you enter the actual restaur it veri dark so dark in fact that the menus have littl flashlight attach to them but decor well 

i went there with a group of peopl we were suppos to meet at 800 but not everyon show up until about 845 to kill time the few of us who were there decid to wait at the bar after a few drink the bartend let us know that appet at the bar were half off sound like a good deal so i order the calamari which was 1499 the bill was nontransfer so when enough of our parti show up to be seat we ask to close out our tab this was the first shadi part

bartend thatll be 1082
me i thought the calamari was 1499
bartend it is
m didnt you tell us appet were half off
bartend well the calamari is 10
me puzzl look
bartend ok fine ummjust give me 8

we sit down at the tabl and look over the menu everyth is typic italian but i realli got sticker shock when i saw the price entre price averag around 24 which wouldnt be that crazi for a fine dine venu but this realli didnt strike me as such a place anyhow the calamari had realli taken the edg off so my girlfriend and i decid to split an entre we order the veal parmigiana which was 2899 

when we order our food it was just after 900 when we got our food it was just befor 1000 grant there were 10 peopl in our group but we were the onli peopl in the place liter i dont know what they were do but i cant rememb the last time my food took that long even in crowd restaur i dont think i would have normal gotten so irrit but i had gotten up at 330 for work that morn and had to wake up at 600 the next morn so i had been antsi to get home and go to sleep

when final get our food i ask for a separ check i admit i had forgotten to ask for it up front but all the other restaur ive been to in this town dodnt have problem split the check up postmeal so i didnt think they would either

m excus me i need to leav soon could i pay for my meal now
waitress im sorri but we cant split the bill after it been created
m oh ok well could you pleas charg the amount of my meal to my card and appli it toward the bill i hold my credit card out
waitress we can onli take two card per bill so onli one other card can be used
m ok well i know the rest of the peopl have cash so im alright with this
waitress fine let me figur out what your total is

about 5 minut pass

waitress your total is 36xx
me 36xx what was the gratuiti i thought the veal was 2899
waitress you two split the meal there a 4 split charge
m you didnt tell us about that when we ordered
waitress it on the menu here see she was right the 4 split charg was indic but it was on the back page underneath the dessert sinc we hadnt gotten to dessert yet we hadnt look at the back page
m ok your right but whi didnt you tell us about this when we ordered
waitress it on the menu so we dont tell peopl about it
m so when someon is ask for someth and will be unknow charg extra you dont think it appropri to let them know
waitress nope were not allow to tell peopl about it 
me not allowed
waitress nope the owner say were not allow to tell peopl about it
m that realli shady
jen could we speak to the manager
waitress i am the manag 
jen well then can we speak to whoever you report to
waitress hes not here
jen well then how doe your restaur handl custom service
waitress fine ill take the 4 off

th waitress is gone for about 10 minut do who know what in the mean time were eat our veal and it was mediocr at best i would say the meat was mayb a coupl millimet thick with twice as much bread the pasta sauc was lack and noth worth go back for i gotta say account for the cost and qualiti you would get an exponenti better deal at oliv garden 

she final came back with our check 3130 and i paid it seem like everyth work out howev after charg my card she didnt stick around long enough for us to ask for a togo contain we wait for about 10 minut befor my girlfriend decid to just go ask for one she walk over to where the kitchen entrancewaitress station was poke her head in and said excus me when the waitress saw her she jump around a corner liter our waitress ran away 

the servic was shadi and the food was mediocr i would onli recommend this place to someon for drinki think capo deserv a 25 becaus of origin but sinc the star wont allow and due to a bigtim let down and poor qualiti ill round down

mi dad was in town for his 60th birthday and he want italian food for a less than outrag price  we can be pretti picki with italian food consid we are italian and the fact that we come from where italian food is actual good nyphillynj  he suggest maggiano becaus we know to expect good qualiti  i didnt want to take him to a chain though i want him to have someth he could onli get in vega so i did my homework on yelp and capo seem like the right choic  a choic i end up regretting

no horror stori here but as you will read the servic and food qualiti just werent there the onli thing good was the atmosphere

upon arriv the entri and speakeasi theme was pretti cool  would have been cooler without a sign that said credit card were current not accept cash onli  but still pretti cool
insid the veri dark environ with mafia decor and old italian resaurant style kept me look around  and an the old vega style loung singer was belt out the sinatra hit in a voic slight better than my own this is not a compliment to my voice

from here it just goe down hill

ther was a half hour wait even though an entir room of tabl was wide open not be use  i didnt realiz wed need a reso be it was a tue night dure the offseason and the place be in a hole in the wall off the beaten path  perhap this was still my fault

th servic was bad  friend enough sure  but we didnt get the water we ask for and even after order we never got a basket of bread until such a long time went by that we wave down the waitress and beg for bread and water  then the bread came and had i not been starv i would have toss it in the garbag  this was possibl the worst bread i have ever tast  is it possibl for bread to be that bad  appar it is  not just bad but terribl stale  i gobbl up the chewi stale loaf anyway becaus i was so hungri from wait near rip out teeth in the process

th main cours eventu came and it was all subpar  edibl yes  in an oliv garden qualiti kind of way mayb a bit wors  the fettuccin alfredo seem like it was straight outta the tv dinner box  the ad shrimp were a nice size

mi dad got ravioli in a red sauc with meatbal  again just edibl  especi sinc we were starv  but a veri generic tast all around  i honest felt embarrass that i brought my pop to eat this

thi is not a true italian place  it is a gimmicki eateri that make it on it speakeasi theme atmospher  if you have ever had real italian food the tast of this food will be a total let downgreat concept bad execution

th idea of the speakeasi style restaur dine is great the dine experi itself not so much

i had to laugh when read steakhous on the menu becaus there just werent that mani steak option shrimp caught my eye in a few dish and the clam did also wed heard great thing about the meatbal but i want seafood it an italian place right seafood and pasta sound easi enough

unfortun by 6 in the even they were out of shrimp  choic number 2 wasnt a bad one though i had the gallow with clam in a red sauc it was good and had a lot of clam the sauc was tasti would have been good if id share it over my husband alfredo becaus that was terribl flavorless sauc  his meatbal howev was excel and veri larg and tender explod with flavor insid i doubt well return here but it was fun to check out id go with my clam again and hed probabl throw a meatbal on top and share  

a salad with a red sauc preceed dinner and was veri good husband dislik the sauc a tiramisu dessert finish up the even and it was great too

w had a groupon but it still wasnt an inexpens dinner for what it was your part pay for the experi though it was fun dine in the dark servic has room for improv we first heard about the place from a fake realiti show that suppos took place there i wish food network would stop air that crap but im glad we had a chanc to check out one of the place it suppos featur 

if this restaur fail i high suggest the owner start a meatbal product factori  freez em and ship out you have a guarante custom in california wait for this dayso today my parent were go to a wine tast that was be held here this restaur has a valet but becaus i wasnt valet i went around the park car to go into the lot to drop off my parents

on of the valet guy start run after my car and scream yes scream at us

i roll down my window and ask if there was a problem he veri rude state that i need to valet my car and demand that we do so 

mi mom and i then explain to him that i was just drop off my parent he then told us that he was just do his job

hir a more classi valet who run and scream after a car  i wasnt even go that fast

zero star for the valet and his attitude

buy my parent said they had a lot of fun at the eventi had come to expect good qualiti from this place but this time around found it veri disappointing

th price was right2 comp buffet the servic was great quick to take the plate on top of the drink refil and extra napkins

th salad  soup bar was great bleu chees chunk for the salad and great chicken noodl soup with tender white meat chicken

they have lot of sushi fri sushi wontonspotstickersdim sum and lot of aian cuisinemost of it is veri weak with littl pop to it

th beef brisket was tender  juici  and had a nice smoki flavor the roast beef was a littl uhhhno season on the meats

th cornish game hen were super juici and veri goodth fri chicken howev was tough and dri out

most of the side dish like mac n chees beanspotato salad coleslaw and collard green were just bland it like it all the same food with no fllavor

th pizza was doughi and the vegtabl and meat were not cook the whole italian section of raviolirotini and spaghetti is all pretti weak dinner they usual do made to order pasta with shrimp etc

th dessert were pretti dri  crusti with a veri limit selectionr diappointing

ther lot of other thing avail but i did not tri tham becaus they didnt even look appeal 

i see there is quit a vari opinion on this place and i would say 6 month ago the food was 4x better now it just seem like all the same qualiti as other station bufffet one of which i tri just yesterday at the palac station 

same tast food red rock had better present plus a littl more selection

for my money im stick to the palmsfilet mignon  crab legwe want to stop somewher close to the freeway to eat as we were about to leav las vega on our way home to los angel we decid to head to the palm assum that they would have a good buffet to eat at we discov the bistro buffet and decid to give it a tri 

the restaur has a veri nice look to it it is modern in appear and has an upscal cafeteria feel about it it is one of the smallest buffet that i have been to in las vega but get seat was not an issu 

the food was not veri good most of it was cold and tast as though it had been sit around for hour condiment were veri hard to find and the whole setup in general seem disorgan the one highlight from the food select was the crab leg they were fair big and precut to make them easier to peel open and eat 

the other highlight of eat here was that the servic was excel our waiter kept our cup fill and clear our dish whenev we finish a plate he was veri accommod and was abl to help us with whatev we need the servic made up a littl bit for the food be sub par 

overal the bistro buffet was a disappoint the food just wasnt good with so mani other option in vega i cant see ani reason for me to eat here againdamn you hail mari i want to like you i realli realli did your so close to my offic you have tvs in each of your comfi leather booth you have cheaptiy cheap cheap draft and a 99 cent happi hour menu whi i ask whi was your food so terrible

i went there with a cowork today all excit after read about how good their chili was right here on yelp and then someth aw happen they brought me my chili if you can even call it that on a plate of spaghetti mound and mound of spaghetti it was the strangest thing ive ever seen not to mention tast there wasnt much chili on top of my spaghetti and it was pretti darn flavorless my chili somehow morph into some realli gnar spaghetti with sweet meat sauc on topdefinit not what i imagined

mi colleagu order the buffalo chicken wrap which came with a side of hand cut fri the fri were limp but flavor the wrap howev was not a winner after he remov all the tomato which he forgot to mention he didnt want there was hard ani chicken in the wrap he said there may have been 1 chicken finger cut up in the entir sandwich kind of a bummer for 8 or 9

we were both obvious disappoint in our meal and our server knew it he did not howev care which was kind of a bummer on top of everyth els i wouldv come back here and given the food anoth shot if the servic was better but now this will remain sole a drink establish for me in the future

on day i will find a sport bar in the greater phx area with dozen of hd tvs and buffalo chicken wrap that come with chicken in them and chili that doe not come on a plate of spaghetti howev sad today is not that dayok  first off i have to admit that this place had good  nay  delici food from pizza to pasta boston did it well that where the good time end

a few year ago this place had everyth go for it great food nice atmospher cool staff and they provid a place for me and my friend to play poker tournament then for some reason the cuntbag that ran the place decid to screw over the compani that was host the tournament and do poker on their own the dipshit didnt realiz that the 60  100 of us that show up week onli came becaus of the compani that ran the poker tournament and the backlash caus most of us to stop come there altogeth as mani of us went there regular even on a non poker night

it had been awhil then sinc i had been here sinc i was boycot it but some friend and i were starv and everywher els was pack so we thought it might still be good and it kinda was the food was still tasti 

first thing i notic when i walk in was that they chang the interior  get rid of some sport memorabilia and some wall it look more generic the place was also kinda desert for a friday or saturday night cant rememb which it seem like there were as mani server as patron 

you would think with those odd we would get amaz servic  nope our waiter was dirt he was sweatti and impati but he brought us our drink took our order and let someon els bring out our food while he spent 40 minut or so chit chat about world of warcraft with his dipshit friend 15 feet away from our tabl meanwhil we were thirsti as fuck and stand next to our booth stare at him  he occasion would look over at us but continu to dismiss us nobodi els ever came by either 

i end up have to go up and ask for more drink and was met with scourn and confus look as though i had done someth wrong well fuck me asshol  im sorri for be thirsti die

th guy eventu conclud is convers about level up and he came over to hand us our check our tabl was never prebuss either mean we had to stare at our dirti plate the entir time we were there wait for drink and the check 

anyway i hate this place now  but their food is good though perhap a bit generic honest you can do better foodwis which is good sinc this place is ass

go fuck yourself bostonoh gotham

th dread disposit of everi person that work there is enough for me to rate you so poor but you know what cranki staff asid i guess this is part of your ny shtick it still hard for me to give you anyth greater than two star as all 3 time ive been there ive left with a botch up order

now shame on me for not check order the second and third time right but shame on you for hear whole wheat bagel with egg and sausag and give me a whole wheat bagel with bacon and chees short of get back there and make the thing myself im not certain how to have a stellar experi at your place of busi 

i could understand if the place was pack i could understand if you were short staf and move quick i could understand if i was make substitut to an exist sandwich and the person make my sandwich got confus i cant understand how when there no line 5 visibl employe and i choos design your own it so blatant wrong and the park situat isnt conduc to someon drive back there to remedi it and so for the third time i threw 6 in the trash

but no more perhap if i hear the oper get tighter if someon tell me it worth anoth shot ill go back but when i do ill order a plain bagel that i adorn with fixin i have in my fridg youv program me to believ there no other wayservic was realli good so well start with that our waiter was realli attentivefriendlyand talkative

i made a reserv and we show up 10 min earli so we had to wait off to the bar we go where i order a cocktail and watch some footbal we wait about 15 more min then we were accept to sit on the wait seat behind the hostess stand great

sat down and went to the salad bar which was pretti good but not as extens as ive seen at other churrascaria all you can eat meat buffet  the seafood pasta in the cream sauc was my favorit  the onli sauc avail here were 2 kind of chimmichurri no horseradish creme sauc or regular horseradish which i typic enjoy with my steak onli green i saw was kale and that was actual pretti tasti 

the guy cut the meat did not smile in fact i dont think one of them crack a smile the whole time they definit need to be more friend  they look like they were in pain each time they came over and would rather be hang themselv than working

i also never saw lamb i look and look for it but it never show up bah bah lamb  i think they onli have 12 of the option they tell you they do  the most memor item were  the bacon wrap scallop grill shrimp and the roast crispi chicken  the steak for me was outback at best and again i did not see as mani option as i thought there should be  the trout and other mysteri white fish should be avoided

no dessert option either or at least a littl someth sweet to eat wouldv been nice 

and it pricey if you are go to spend 120150 for a dinner for 2 peopl in vega especi for a steak this place is not what you are look for see my steak list for vegas

ev popular would i go back  no i dont think so unless someon els had a coupon and was payive hit everi brazilian churrascaria in town even everi one in rio de janeiro braziland pampa by farrank bottom of the barrel in food qualityth 3 other one in vega are far superior

if you come here and pay full price you are sillya they have 2 for 1 offer all over town and on the internet if you search long enoughand that is reason enough to tri it out and think well 2025 per person is somewhat reason as their competit in town seldom offer deal and you end up pay over 120 for two tax tip but for far better qualiti and excel salad bar

service
th last time i was here we sat for over 7 minut to start out our meal befor we had a gaucho come over readi to carv out some meatand they arent that person like in some other place kind of robotic

th salad bar doesnt have muchthrow a coupl heart of palm on my plate and im donenot go to fill up on fettuccini alfredo

th best cut of meat for me was the leg of lamb and the balsam vinegar mix they use to sauc it over but of cours that came around onc over the cours of an hour and we were sit in the middl of the room

th filet mignon is bacon wrap and too salti and extrem tough for what is suppos to be the most tender cut of meatand i hope you like it mediumwel becaus that all they had

if you can find a coupon id say give it a shot but if you want qualiti and realli good food tri fogo de chao texa de brazil and via brasil here in vega 

the qualiti of meat at pampa vs it local competit is like night and dayi probabl go here everi 6 mos or so if im with a meat eater that is and they have to have in n out the grill chees is consist good and my kid like em too along with the fri that sometim come w a fish tast at no extra charg chocol shake are alway fun though and most everyon i go with regret eat the burger afterward though they say dude that was a good call you had a grill chees huhuhuhuuuh i dont feel too great im not big on onion so the anim style stuff doesnt do it for me either sorri folk 

i rememb when in n out came to town good word you couldnt even get into the damn place they would have cone up in the park lot with cop direct traffic i think it way overr but they pay the kid that work here more than minimum wage and well the meat eater need to eat still righti was so excit to tri this place final after see them on cupcak war i wouldnt say im a cupcak snob but i have my like and  dislik with sprinkl and kara i still dont have a favorit cupcakeri though i do love certain flavor at the place ive been to i have tri sweet daddi in glendal three time tri to like it but have come to the same conclus each time ive been there i dont like that place and bigger cupcak do not mean theyr better but i digress

i bought four todaystrawberri brown velvet banana and orang blossom i couldnt even wait to get home to tri one so i open the box right in the store and ate the strawberri i was underwhelm i have a big sweet tooth but the cake and frost were way too sweet not onli that but the frost had the consist of shorten extrem dens and greasi i felt like i was eat flavor butter i ate the whole thing but it didnt sit well in my stomach i went home and took a nap i woke up want a snack so i tri the orang blossom cupcak again the frost was extrem greasi and dens i had to scrape the frost off this time becaus i couldnt bear to eat it all now my stomach feel unwel almost like that time i came back from heart attack grill when it was in chandler becaus of all the lard i ate so the verdict i will not be back and the quest for perfect cupcakeri continuive visit butterfield on sever occas and while i am never let down by the food or the servic i alway feel a bit rush  yes i understand that there are peopl wait for tabl and the quicker you can get me out of there and the next tabl in the more money you will make but what happen today was a real disappoint  

mi daughter and i stop in for breakfast at 915 this morn  the restaur was onli about 34 full so we were seat immedi  we place our drink order moment after we were seat and as soon as our server return with our drink we order our breakfast  our food was serv within five minut  everyth was prepar exact as we had request  

we were still enjoy our meal when the bus person stop by to clear some dish  he attempt to take my two year old daughter plate becaus she was not activ eat it  i stop him and said she was still work on it  he also ask if he could clear my side order of pancak  there was still half of the order of on my plate and we had onli been eat for about seven minut  i told him i was not finish and he left our tabl empti hand  

about seven more minut pass befor he return  my daughter had eaten everi last drop of her kid chocol chip pancak and strip of bacon so he clear her plate  he again tri to clear my pancak plate despit the fact that i was hold my fork in my hand  i told him onc more that we were still work on them  

our server came by and offer me anoth ice tea  i accept and ask that she bring the check and a small box for my leftov  she return with the tea check and take out box moment later  i told her i need to take my daughter to the restroom but that we would be come back right back to finish up as i hand her my debit card to pay

when we return to the tabl it had been complet clear  my daughter orang juic 329 for a kid size which was near full was gone as was the untouch ice tea my server had just brought and my side of pancak  the take out box with the remaind of my corn beef hash and egg was sit on the edg if the tabl with my check wait to be sign  the tabl had alreadi been set for the next guest  unbelievablew had onli been in the restaur for 31 minut from the time we enter the door until we came back to our clear table

if you remov the obnoxi overzeal busser from this equat our meal would have been four star  it was delici  our server was friend enough  she made sure our need were met and check on us often  

i will like return to give butterfield anoth chanc but if i am ever rush like i was today you can rest assur i will not return  i hope to be abl to updat this review with a coupl extra star soonlocat insid the mall area of planet hollywood 

decid to give this place a tri sinc it was right across the theater we were watch our show 
ton of tv so you can watch all the sport you want

pint of blue moon1000 that is a bit much
garl steak fri good amount of garlic and parmesan 
12 wing med nice crunch to it ranch was a bit water down 
garlic ballsit was good not bad 

i would give ani place a tri at least onc but i wont come here againso i had just gotten back from a weekend in kansa citi where i ate bbq the entir weekend i had been crave it sinc come back to scottsdal so we decid to tri this place becaus of all the excel review  what a mistak  the rib were ined burnt to a crisp i dont know how my boyfriend even ate them  i ate a littl of the beef brisket it wasnt bad the cole slaw wasnt too bad either but i still can not get over how bad the rib were  i will never go there againnever trust a bbq place that serv it meat drown in bbq sauc and greas  mediocr at best border on not good  side were meh bbq suck price were high  i cant believ so mani peopl come herei start look through yelp for a great italian place to take my wife for mother day sinc she love italian and we rare eat it when we go out becaus i am not a fan but after check out the review i decid that we would tri ventano i decid to hop on open tabl and make a reserv for 4 for mother day i was pretti excit to take her here becaus of all the hype that i had read it is unfortun that it did not live up to it let me explain 

we walk in and let the ladi work the door know we had reserv and she say no problem let me see what we can do after a minut or so she ask us to step to the side and sit in a odd place booth by the front door while we wait this may seem nit picki but it seem it would be a much nicer sittingwait area without the tabl anyway we then wait there for between 10 and 15 minut while watch them seat other parti of 4 or more while we just sat there anoth ladi who i am assum is a manag or owner was walk around check on the place and help clear a tabl that is on a rais area right when you walk in and then came and seat us i can deal with wait to be seat yes it is irrit when you make a reserv just to find yourself wait 

onc we were seat it took quit a while for the server to even come to the tabl to offer drink or even say hello all while i am overhear the older coupl sit right behind us prais who i am assum was the manag about how awesom his servic was onc we final order our drink the next thing that caught me off guard was when he walk by and set a brown bag with bread stick in it on our tabl now i dont know if that is the regular procedur and if it is in our opinion which may not mean too much it is veri tacki to come to a restaur sell 2530 entre and be hand a greasi brown bag with bread stick in it 

so now that my kid have breadstick and are happi that they have some food we are now readi to order and again we wait for an extend amount of time to order and everi drink on our tabl went complet empti the waiter then came over and we order my son order a pizza my daughter got the alfredo  my wife got the veal marsala and i order filipino chicken adobo i know that sound odd but i guess the chef is filipino and has this on the menu onc the food came i thought it would be the save grace my daughter fetticini was graini but everyth els was good but the part that was odd to me is that the filipino adobo dish was by far the best dish at our tabl to the point that my wife the italian food lover took my adobo sauc and put it on her noodl from the marsala becaus she said the sauc was just ok 

so now we fight the battl of pay the bill the server came back with the check quit a while after we had finish and i tri to get my card to him quick and unfortun he walk away befor i could hand it to him so i look at the bill 83 for 4 of us with 2 of them be kid kid drink at a 3 price point each was a littl excess and i although the food was ok it was definit not worth the 2530 price rang that is be charg we sat again for anoth 25 minut exact yes we time it befor the server came back to take our check onc we paid we fill out the feedback card which i high doubt made it to manag nobodi is go to hand their boss someth that say well the food was just okay and your servic was absolut horrend 

i person cannot stiff anyon and this was the first time in my life that i want to walk out without leav ani tip no drink refil and an 83 lunch that took from 1245 when we walk in the door until 250 when we walk out is crazi i could onli imagin if everi server in that place was that slow and non attent they would seat onli 48 parti at that tabl all day with an averag 2 hour meal time  i want to like this place becaus the locat is great but the bottom line is that even if the food was just ok and not great and they had stellar servic i would come back over and over again but with the food be just ok and the servic be horribl i know that i will not go out of my way to go back or recommend anyon to go thereoh my whi did i stop here somehow i got trap in the imperi palac sure the ugliest casino hotel on the strip i had it in my head that mayb it would be a tribut to the classic frank lloyd wright hotel in tokyo that was most demolish forti year ago but no it just a fauxjapanes facad cover an oldstyl hotel that look like it lost it bloom sometim in the 1960s 

the burger palac caught my eye on a promis banner and i was feel peckish after chang hotel in the morn i thought it would be one of those gourmet burger place with all the trim nope it a fast food joint with littl imagin just a lot of sport mural and tealcolor booth that are a bit of a squeez for us girthchalleng diner perhap that was their sublimin messag to stay away 

i should have listen as i had a particular greasi cheeseburg and fri for about 875 it came with a lemonad which would have been fine had i order it i spent a good three minut argu with the snippi counter girl that i order a diet pepsi all in all i would have prefer have a big mac down the block 

food  2 starsburg had heft but it was most made of greas 
ambianc  15 starsfast food at it lowest common denomin 
servic  1 starreal sur but that must be the drawback of wear a funni paper hat 
total  2 starsthey are lucki i feel charit toward them given the ugli date hotel they are inlook for a quick meal and a place to watch some footbal i stumbl upon this place although not a looker the place was pack so there was hope for a good meal here then i open the menu 15 salad 13 hot dog 35 dri age steak serious is anyon order a 35 dri age steak at a sport bar i opt for a quesadilla and a heineken then bounc asap staff was friend but this was a one and done dine experi 

tip if your look for a quick meal suck it up and hit up the bk whopper bar insteadam i the onli person in the state who doesnt need to eat here  can someon tell me what i am miss  i just dont get the hype  the food is ok noth stand out as must come back for  i will keep come becaus my sister and mother are addict and i am sure there is someth on the menu i can find that i will likeafter have dine here befor  given it 4 star i rave it up to norm r robyn n  mike c who join me for lunch here today

wel this place was a disappoint today  each of us order the same thing the mix grill a platter that was suppos to come with gyro chicken kabab kafta kabab rice babaganoush hummus and pita bread

  after a littl while our platter show up miss the gyro     

  after some back and forth we were serv the two strip each of gyro but it was veri greasi  we shouldnt have had to ask for it either let alon beg     

  i tri to order a bowl of their renoun lentil soup but they didnt have ani     

  on top of everyth els this plate was expens at 1249     

ugh  i doubt ill be return to this one especi sinc we have excel altern such as alhana     when you compar fair trade to conspir and lux  ummm  well  there is no comparison  fair trade decor is bland and last time i went there the barista was less than personable

also they lack the electr outlet at everi tabl which at this late state in the game is a fail for ani coffeehousyay good locat  close to me and easi to get to
yay free reliabl wifi

meh the coffe not fall over good but not burnt up heartburninduc starbuck style either 
meh the food now grant i havent been for lunch but the am select doe not knock me out i would think a place as hippiedippi and crunchi granola as this would be somewhat into remot healthi food instead there were lot of bagel greasi croissant etc the onli thing on my vegetarian healthconsci radar was whole wheat banana bread which was total blah and not even realli bananay

boo have to get a key to get into the bathroom i understand the point but as someon who will pee everi hour for the entir durat of my stay not cool
boo crappi loud lilith fairesqu music sorri i left my strapon at home mayb at night when peopl are just hang the tune would be ok but in the morn i saw lot of poor downtrodden soul like me hunch over laptop book or in serious convers with someon els in a busi suit peopl who were actual tri to you know work

a much as i want to support independ busi i high doubt ill be back there just too mani other great place to goi eventu stop go here the servic becam extrem slow and the qualiti of coffe declin found some better option in the neighbourhood tooi honest dont like to write review about fast food place becaus realli for the most part you get what you pay for and there noth extraordinari or unextraordinari about the food usuallyit just a quick easi fix

that be said  realli not impress with the chickfila on stapley i went through the drive thru tonight  friday night around 930 there liter no one insid and onli one car in front of me and yet they had me wait at the window forev for my food most fast food joint  your in your out done deal not the case here at least not tonight

i final got my food and the fri could bare pass as warm i thought mayb the wait was becaus the guy was do a new batch of fri but no these were quit stale no salt and pretti much cold within a short time

th soda  diet dr pepper  was water down 

there were like 8 peopl behind the counter just mess around not do anything

and it cost me over 7 for a crappi meal lesson learn will not be return therewhen my parent were separ well they still are except this time all their talk is done through lawyer instead of airborn furnitur my father and i use to come here a lot 

not by choic mind you my brother alway had their birthday at red lobster and so it would have just remind my dad of all the famili time we had and hed go crazi again the same thing happen whenev he hear christma music or drive by cabella i wish i was make this up i realli do

th food at mcgrath is pretti mediocr even without my associ of shrimp scampi with watch my dad cri and mumbl about murder all of us when we would least expect it that my poor poor brain has developed

th fish is spars and overpr even for a seafood restaur in a landlock state i mean i might not be a fisherman or anyth but ive seen some on the discoveri channel and salmon are usual bigger than that 

and that isnt catfish i dont care what your chef back there say it not it might be someon cat but it is definit not catfish

if fishermen actual had to subsist on that flavorless tomato pure you call fishermen stew like you claim they did there be no fishermen nor would there be ani whaler and bob marley would have never found a backup band

im just grate that my dad ruin this place for me and not you know a real fish hous 

i would have never recov072011

a child host greet and sat us at a booth  ok shes asian so she probabl was 13 year old i know how it is when i was 18 peopl thought i was 12 and now im well let just get back to the review shall we  we both order water and i studi the menu  after about ten minut the server that kept walk by our tabl final approach to ask if i we were readi to order  i ask if the bbq pork lo mein came w veget  he said that the chow mein had mushroom but the lo mein would not have ani veggi  no veggi i ask  can you add some  he said after some thought bok choy and i said yes  i also ask if broccoli and snow pea can be ad  he said ok  no celeri or carrot ok  he nod yes  i also order a batch of crab puffs

th crab puff arriv 15 minut later all goldenbrown and smell wonder  i like the crunch of the freshfromthefry wonton wrap but found that the sweeten cream chees and crab fill too sweet  i decid to eat a coupl befor the entre and save the rest for dessert  i found that i enjoy the crab puff more when i thought of it as a dessert and not as an appet  the lo mein arriv four minut after 19 minut after time of order look delici but definit cook w carrot  i didnt complain and let the matter drop  id onli expect bok choy broccoli and snow pea instead i saw bok choy carrot cabbag bean sprout spring onion and garlic  the exclus of broccoli was aok i hadnt realli want it in there i just didnt want just bok choy  the dish was veri good  love the sauc that it was saute in though the bbq pork was a littl too fatti for my tast i work around it  what i realli didnt enjoy were the piec of bitter bok choy  some were sweet and after find two bitter chunk i thought id see if there was a reason whi they were bitter  aha  those that were bitter were bite close to base of the stalk which had particl that look like dirt while those that tast sweet were cube piec or stalk that didnt contain those dirtlik particl see photo  needless to say i felt lessenthus about the noodl after that  back to those crab puffs

httpwwwyelpcombizphotosrnqsjfrm09tvojrtaf66gselectphzjqhzvrwbhmsxwv5aydgi find it hard to believ that anyon would rate a coco a 5 star experi but to each their own i happen to find this locat pretti much ass when i happen in here with mom and grandma in tow 

grow up in phoenix coco and bob big boy then jbs and villag inn were the onli coffe shop type restaur around and coco was alway good sad the memori of the chain and the realiti of this locat didnt match up 

we arriv around 1pm on a sunday and though it wasnt my choic to eat here i agre grandma was hungri and want pancak we walk in to a pretti pack restaur and were seat fair quick by a teenag host we sat and sat and sat and sat look at our menus and me look around at other tabl who were also sit to either order get their check or their food turn out not onli was it the b team it was probabl the c team when our waitress final arriv to take our order i realiz she was the onli one work the entir dine room and one other waitress was work the other half of the restaur the host 2 teen i notic were stand around basic do noth and the kitchen seem behind on get food out to custom 

grandma had her pancakesi had to track down the coffe to refil her coffe and sever other custom mom had a blt which was skimpi and i had a cup of their soup of the day cream of broccoli which was like eat a spoon full of salt and noth could help it go down 

i was surpris that this locat especi be locat in sun citi had such a lack of employe work i was also surpris at the amount of famili therebut i forget that sunday is often go to lunch after church day

i will skip this locat in the futur and hit up the jbs next door villag inn or actual get some decent coffe shop type grub at cracker barrel down the street oh and if grandma want pancak again i might even ventur just past the 101 on bell and hit up ihop befor i hit up this place againit had been a lot of year and i was think you know some question cow and fake horseradish sauc might just hit the spot

their signatur roast beef sandwitch come in 3 size small medium and someth approach the size of your head 

i think my meal had enough salt in it to pay a roman legion with but sinc the legion today are paid in feder reserv fiat greenback the salt goe to arbi mayb ill tri it again after i time travel into the futur a few yearthis was my veri first time to a pei wei i was excit to tri them out the wonder and strong smell that wrap around your nose as soon as you step in to the place caus some form of excit in your stomach for the food that await but in all honesti pei wei left me want more more flavor more spice and better textur it was not as good as i had expect it to be and i had high hope for it sinc my former cowork had been rave on how good the food was from this place i will tell you that the lettuc wrap were good and i think the best thing i had from them that day i also had some of the spici orang chicken and that lack flavor and chicken it felt like i was eat a ball of dough cover with sauc and with the minim amount of chicken on it and the pork egg roll was not that tasti neither was the fri rice i know other may love it but it was simpli not for me 
thank anyway it not you pei it me i was so hope the food here was go to be good i had a coupon for the filet mignon 1000 add 20000 for salad bar when i order it the guy said let me see if we have ani  i was like are you serious or are you just kid no he was serious so befor i order it i ask if he was a steak man and he said he was he said the filet mignon was big thick and it melt in your mouth 

it was far from thick it was a thin slab of meat but it most certain was not a filet mignon i could get a much better filet mignon at outback ani day of the week 

he also told me that i didnt need a coupon that is the price on the menu  so i done get it i cut out the coupon make sure i come at the right time to use it and i didnt even need it anyway

th salad bar was horribl 

one good thing is outsid santa came in a helicopt to greet the kid the line to get to sit in his lap was about an hour but worth it  had it not been for santa it would have been a bust

i went to culver basically

now i get what freddi is tri to be  although freddi has a mytholog that  lay claim to be the origin of the burger style culver just doe it better   httpwwwyelpcombizculversphoenixhridydsmvl72kitxdkewukhlog

they do everyth better  from friend custom servic cleanli to the fresh and tasti food and the thick yet crisp on the outsid crinkl cut frys were simpli a model of perfect on the delic greasycrispi spectrum

th basic sunda automaticali come with 2 flavor of top so they arent tri to unfair skrimp you for skrilla left and right with extra  veri cool culver   boo freddi for be so lacklust with custom servic overseason with food and general failmy wife and i bought a 30 groupon for mannysth taco and enchilada were decent enoughi like the free chip and salsabut the servic was lackadais at bestand neglig at worstand it was a veri slow time of day
                 we got our billand the total was about 21we were then told we had to use the whole 30i said it was okw can forfeit the restw were then inform that the bill had to be 30so they could add the 18 gratuiti in the fine print on the grouponthat finego aheadw get the revis billand they ad the extra sale tax of bump it to 30along with the gratuityto reviewa 21 bill becam a 39 billit was onli nine dollar out of my pocketno biggiebut what a rinki dink way of do business
           i live onli a few mile from hereif the servic and attitud had betteror even made sensethey would have had a steadi customera it isgroupon would have to pay me to go backi visit wing stop again after 9 month or so it was as good as i rememb onli less so as in it wasnt that good last time and was less good this time i tri the cajun sauc and i dont realli know what it is suppos to be but it was kind of hot and kind of buffalo sauc and kind of jerkherbi and hard to pin down like this sentenc it was a littl aimless in it flavor and just didnt do much for me so this was probabl my last visit to wing stop  yupmake someth as generic as possibl to appeal to as mass a crowd as we can must have been the proprietor busi plan

thi place remind me of the sportsbarlik area insid of a chili onli overgrown into the entir establishment

annoy decor staff  and yes crowd too  they had the same footbal game on everi singl tv in the hous even those screen right next to each other  noth but stupid logic there  they also use this footbal game as an excus to postpon the start of the schedul poker game that theyd agre to host but onli becaus they wouldnt use one of the tvs to show the poker stat screen  whistle

penalty

lamgot a groupon but this place just jack up their price so it not realli a deal meat was discolor in the case fresh i think noti never have high expect for sport bar there isnt ani reason to  walk in to oggi i felt no differ than i do walk in to ani other similar establish  we came in and were seat in a half full restaur  the bar area was fair busi as there was a game go on

th food is realli not good  everyth is quit greasi and not in a good way  trust me i like greasi  they were also out of multipl menu item and a coupl beer  of cours they didnt inform us of that beforehand so  when i order the dish i want i was told no then my husband order what he want and told no again  jeez  i guess they have never heard of prep  i final settl on the fettucini alfredo as it a simpl dish and hard to screw up  well they did  it all veri generic and the pasta was overcook and mushi  ugh  servic was soso

i will not be back simpl as that  i dont recommend this place to anyoni was in the area and decid to stop for lunch the food was great and came out realli quick 

the servic on the other hand could use a lot of improv if the waitress werent chat so much they might not make mistak my waitress ran my credit card for someon els bill and they still over charg me after attempt to correct it 

i will not be go back everi use to live here and frequent this restaur the appl pancak were unreal the cinnamon roll was serv hot and fresh with butter to spare quaint atmospher and friend staff 

that what i wouldv written on my last review but we came back to visit with our toddler and some friend and were veri disappoint 

cinnamon roll came out cold and stale they heat it up but it was to stale for it to matter even my 2 year old lost interest 

the famous appl pancak use to be serv with butter and special syrup cover the whole thing almost fall off the plate i was bum to see the plate come with pancak lukewarm with noth on them the waitress brought the syrup on the side 5 minut later no butter the syrup was less than 12 of the amount it use to be

two of us had order bacon and egg to accompani our meal they both came out cold i sent mine back ask for them to be taken off the check think i would just pay for the rest of the meal and be on my way this obvious isnt the place that it use to be and i was fine and readi to pay and leave

what i assum was the managerown came to see what the problem was we told her and she question whi we didnt say someth sooner and walk off she took off the cinnamon roll instead which was a nice enough gestur but that not what i ask for i point it out and she rude told me it would take anoth 10 minut to take the item off the bill and threw 3 cash on the tabl instead insist that she couldv made it right i point out that with our toddler we didnt have enough time for a 2nd round of food to make it right and she just said were veri busi  

there was no im sorri or give us anoth tri next time this one on us  this is what good custom servic sound like  it was pretti obvious they just want us gone and pay as much of the bill as possibl i paid my bill left a generous tip for our origin waitress who was veri friend but i wont be back ill go up the road 12 mile to liberti market or farmhous grill therer too mani other option out there to wast a meal out with manag like thatno doubt the pizza is excel here but the servic suck the first time i went there there was a line outsid the door to their credit both regist were man but when it came to be my turn the cashier asian femal decid she didnt want to do ani more work and just wander off when she decid to come back she spent the next 15 minut chat to her friend on her phone eventu she decid to serv me and got the order wrong gee thank for noth ladi 

the second time i decid to call the order in hello z pizza can you hold can you hold some more hello can you hold unfortun they dont wait for you to answer befor put you on hold so you are sol i began the call when i was a 30 minut drive from the place and finish the call in their park lot i walk in expect the place to be slam but no it dead more employe than custom and guess what theyr chat chat chat away  with each other 

this place would be great with an effect manag in place or mayb just ani manag2 star in yelp lingo mean meh ive experienc better and i have i order the capres salad and it was serv with foccacia while a generous portion of bread the tomato and mozzarella round were the size of roma slice it was dull 

there were some interest cocktail but my bitter and soda which is club soda with a shake of aromat bitter in it  help for upset stomach came in a smaller glass and i got charg for refil ive never been charg for refil on bitter and soda befor anywher els frank that irrit me quit a bit 

i could have had a mojito for what my 3 club soda cost 

and i dont have a problem with gluten or a compuls to eat organ so im not desper enough to let those demand compensyet anoth mexican fast food place made popular by peopl with no tast bud or basic food knowledg yay i should have knowk by the custom base to turn around and walk right back out the door instead of wait in line i need to learn to go with my gut more but no i thought id give it a chanc and peopl kept annoy me about the tortilla here they are giant thin and not even fulli cook tortilla so what so good about them again the menu here is pretti damn bore some basic ass mexican fare which in some part of the countri none of these item even exist just a guess but mayb just mayb some of you were high befor go up in this carolina north 

mi ma had a green chile burro it was the worst ever congrat it bare had ani meat in it or green chile that right it was a green chile burro made with mayb a teaspoon of actual green chile the rest was basic gravi not the good kind either i mean a lot of flour and water mix in to the sauc that it was not even green it was gray gross a gravi burro doesnt sound too appet now doe it the green chile burro get 1 star here peopl 

i had the chees enchilada w rice and bean the rice was quit edibl not burnt or crunchi but surpris fresh tast and moist i would eat it again if i had too the bean were not bad either noth spectacular last but not least the chees enchiladasthey were good i ate them and i dont even like red enchilada sauc 

now if i was in the area of the origin locat i would probabl give it anoth go for sure this locat not so much howev there is a far better mexican place up the road that serv way better option and ummm real mexican food and i dont care if it cheap here eitheri was in phoenix on a busi trip with 3 fellow worker and we want a good steak  i check yelp and found tbone and we like the review we saw so we set off in search of it  

first not know the area we had to get lost and ask direct from the wrong peopl two time  we final got to the right area and past it and found the deadend street  we backtrack  12 a block and found a small sign tack to a post say tbone steak hous  so it was off to the left of 19th befor the deadend for peopl look for it

i like rustic place and this one look cool with a veri nice view of the city

i order the 16oz tbone steak which also come with the salad bar  cowboy bean  went to get a salad while wait for the steak and found the salad bar the smallest i have ever seen  it was a larg bowl of lettuc small bowl of chees wasnt sure what it was at first so dark and crouton and three dress  oh and a veri larg bowl of cold green bean with onion and a vinegar dress on it  oh well we main came for a good steak right  the steak came and they were all also a disappoint my 16oz tbone look just like my friend 24oz porterhous  we had order medium rare and they were just medium bear ani pink and not juic  the bread look like texa toast that was not toast 

i did eat all the steak and a salad but i was hungri but wouldnt ever consid go back again  sorri but no i didnt enjoy it as much as the other reviewstill havent heard from manag kevin  will keep experi short  plan a surpris parti for friend we all work in the area   34 rsvpd and 42 show   i got there earli to decor 630 event date  that night manag greet me and gave me choic of area  tabl were set for 6 but onli fit 4 comfort  eye roll when i mention this was told these were design for us  when more show up as often happen better more than less i was told we could not overflow to empti tabl  are you kid me treat them as walkin and take their order   one waitress comment that whi i hate work these event    i thought the object was to work for tip with good servic  when one person final got waitress attent you want anoth one beer shed had onli one  i could go on and on but dont want to get irrit again  and an 18 gratuiti was was ad to everyon bill mani had to wait unreason long for food and servic and felt gratuiti too much  i never sat down as i was tri to keep folk calm and happi  the food was fair noth special  i plan work gather often in the area last one here   mani of the guest live nearbi and said they would not return   south phx has mani choic now will book with them  i call kevin sever time prior to event to make sure all was in order  ive yet to hear back from him after event  ive even email him on websit say perhap hed like to call for feedback befor i yelp   cricket    may be okay for a group of 4 not abl to handl a larg group   bartend start wait tabl and was veri rude   need a steak hous   ive use rustler roost for 45 and have onli compliment   yeah my event was tbone crash with terribl servic

but my foodi friend and i agre that everi time we have come here the servic has lag beauti space though which is whi we alway hope for success

i am steadili unimpress by the food i have had dinner here and this was my first time have sunday brunch the best part of it was my amaz cinnamon rollth orang juic was great but it was a tini glass and they put ice in it wtf if im pay for fresh squeez orang juic on top of a small glass pleas leav out the ice

i had the fri egg sandwich nice present great tast sandwich came with a side of potato btw i could live in a potato and eat my way out so i am sad they look great but are tasteless so tasteless i didnt even finish them that a first

on top of everyth wait almost an hour for our food 

so sinc im steadili unimpress by this beauti spot i will go back but onli for drink they cant mess that upafter 3 experi i think i can admit that i am not crazi about st franci  this last meal confirm it and is by far the most tell  first of all our server rant and rave about the cioppino  when she said she got to enjoy one after win a contest at which point i should have know she was more of a saleswoman than a true guid of the menu  she rant and rave about the cheesi bread includ in the dish not exact a tradit stapl of cioppino but i thought id give it a tri  it tast like delici chees bread in the middl of ragu and old seafood  good cioppino is rare but it not rocket scienc  this was easili the worst dish st franci has done in my experi and for the price and reput they tri to uphold this is inexcus  

happi hour at st franci  good  pizza  they use the crust from lgo so it better be decent  it a good thing st franci has a good locat beauti build hipster popular and great happi hour  general phoenix diner will be abl to look past the low qualiti food for those reason  true qualiti foodseek will look elsewher  ill give you a tri again in a few month st franci i hope you can hold on to a few decent cook and a chef long enough to make some changthe room and patio far better than averag the coffe and snax barfaroo i met a student here yesterday to discuss her thesi and there were onli a few time our convers was drown out by the sound of the frap or frost machin or the larg parti of bur biker who came in hey if hell angel type think this place is cool enough for them who am i to argu 

i order a black  white frost which was advertis as a white and dark chocol frozen mocha i was horrifi when the barista ad milk to a cup of ice and then a heap scoop of some powder shit and threw it in the blender it was foul hyper sweet and yet acrid all at the same time the baklava a soggi nasti wast of phyllo dough the other snack item didnt look appet at all tight wrap muffin and clamshel chocol cake and cheesecak all from costco 

if what goe insid their patron could someday match their surround wed have a truli awesom coffe shop on our handthe marg were good for 2 bux they certain did the trick fa sho 2 domest as well dure hh it was a thur and hh is from 36 i think the servic was not so great the girl seem a bit new she had to go check to see what the special were she disappear for 10 minut food and drink took age but we did endur they could have drop a few more  into their patio becaus serious i dont think it up to code yike it a realli poor attempt if you tri to lean on the rail you will see what i mean 

wing  no prob frozen
salsa  good
chil relleno  pretti gosh darn good 
i was thrown a bit becaus it wasnt bread and basic all egg white so it was kinda weird but the sauc was soooo hot you have been warn the green chili is dope no fire ass whiner aloud

mi paahtna order a carn asada burro first it came with main onion in it so he ask for one wout onion then i guess they thought itd be funni if they put red pepper all up in it instead he couldnt handl the heat hes italian shhhh in it but the joke on them cuz i finish it for him and had no problem lol it was good 

it close and drink are cheap ill sit in door next time it would be better if they got a bit more structur with their special  they rang anywher from 299  899 and mayb a bit smaller portion im not realli sure what id wait through to get some of that green chili sauc though it is bombcosta vida wasnt outright bad but it wasnt veri good either  i share a coupl entreesfish taco and nacho with steak

th fish taco had ittybitti piec of fish cover by lot of mango salsaso all you could tast was an odd sweet flavor  no fish

th steak nacho were decent but the nacho were heavi on salsa  i mean heavi  like 45 big scoopssoggyswimminginsalsa nacho are not realli veri good  good nacho are about a nice well round blend of chees meat bean and a smallish amount of sour cream andor guac with a littl salsa

not like to returnso i final broke down and tri grimaldi pizza one thing ive learn about live in the phoenix area is to never have high expect for ani restaur that way youll never leav disappoint grimaldi fulfil my low expect and was mediocr in everi way

to start the pizza crust was good crispi throughout and bubbl up around the edg as one would expect from a brick oven pizza howev there was no discern flavor to the crust so who cares

now for the sauc the most bland flavorless noth of a sauc that make a person wonder if the chef understand that there is someth call spice that can be ad to food to enhanc flavor whatev happen to the sauc be the secret to a dish here is a note oregano basil thyme rosemari marjoram etc are spice that italian love to use in their food you should tri them or mayb just begin with salt and pepperwhen my famili move to surpris 4 year ago i love macayo it was my favorit place to grab mexican food in surpris over the past 18 month it has realli gone down on my last visit the server told me she brought me what i order and i must have order wrong what even if i did it would have been nice for the server to attempt to fix the problem 

i will continu to go to macayo with friend and sit in the bar for happi hour as for a place to regular go to meal with my famili not so muchtook the kid here lastnight for dinner  i woke up that is a good sign  i am bum to see that in 2 year we were away this place realli took a dive  the price went up thequal of the food went down and got smaller the servic was aw  our order was all jack up  i could go on and on just becaus my son and i ask for no sauc doesnt mean we dont want the sour cream  the shit was dri and we had to power down our food with soda shot like we were on fear factor  no refil chip suck ok that right i was tri to stop the compliment train 

we use to love come here now we will add it to the dont eat at list with carrapa  even our server look like he would have rather been anywher but there  sad thing is i rememb him from when we use to dine here all of the time  poor guy use to be so chipper and happi  place suck the life right out of him

mi one complaint is about pay  i use to be a server i know how this work  all i had on me was a 100  dinner came to rough 4000  all larg bill when he gave me chang  yes i know they arent a bank  and i did not take off star becaus of this gripe  but just becaus i pay like a high roller doesnt mean i am one and i am not go to over tip becaus all of the sudden onc you saw my loot you thought you could save the last 90 minut of tortur we endur  a 5 and 5 one would have been nice there was no way i was about to spot a 20 

when a custom sit at your station whi dont you treat them like a friend not a bastard step child and mayb just mayb i would have spot you a few extra bone for make the most of the crappi night25 stars

thi store has realli gone downhil  this visit could veri well be my last one  i would rather drive to the temp locat and deal with the panhandl go forward  not sure how the owner of this store would oper it with my experi below

mi famili and i place our order good so far  were familiar with the menu so no have to guess  if you are not familiar with fat burger they acknowledg your tip of a dollar or more by the whole crew shout fat tip when prompt by the cashier  i alway give the kid a buck to get them to shout well they just stare at me this time  we walk over to the booth and find two out if the three booth duct tap togeth post a pic of the red duct tape  i could not peek at the third booth sinc it was be use but if i had to guess it had red duct tape too  my daughter want a milk shake with her meal not today they ran out of ice cream it would have been easier if i was told of the outag while order rather than the cashier tri to figur out how much money was owe to me  we get our meal and my wife head over to the ketchup dispens to find they were out of the self serv ketchup  no problem i will ask for some i am told they are almost out of ketchup and am hand like 4 or 5 to go packet  i just left it at that sinc they were almost out

a we are eat our meal i hear the kid prepar the food yell were out of thousand island first thought was what els are they go to run out of  the next thought was hey did someon drop a dollar on the tip jar to get them to shout

thi review is strict for this locat  i hope this owner clean up the place a bit and suppli the place with enough stuff to oper normalafter read all the good review of the other mesa cracker and co i went to this one becaus it closer to my hous 

i dont know what all the hype is about i found it to be just about the blandest most bore overpr breakfast ive had in a long time i got the vatican which is a skillet with egg cook to order hash brown red and green bell pepper onion mushroom and bit of bacon along with sausag and chees all mix togeth i got the chees on the side and end up not put much on it was about 850

first the sausag wasnt breakfast sausag or perhap it like no breakfast sausag ive seen it appear to be italian sausag or some rendit the piec were big and not my cup of tea at all id have much rather had tradit breakfast sausag it clear the standard whi mess with it mayb becuas it call the vatican but still i wish it was mark on the menu that the sausag was differ i pull all of them off my plate i dislik them so much 

the skillet had no season whatsoev im not a big fan of salt but it tast like they didnt put ani salt on anyth or ani season for that matter i had to salt my food which i never do usual i think thing are too salti eat out 

the hashbrown were pretti good but it hard to mess that up noth els was tasti i end up dump cholula over the whole thing which made it more edibl it was relat greasi for how unflavor it was even the english muffin that came on the side was flat and not veri doughi most of the wait staff seem pretti nice but our waitress wasnt all that great and onli check on us onc even though she pass everi 2 minut to get to other tabl 

i would not tri this place again their dessert did look good if your into that thingi left this place feel extrem unimpressed

i had the spici mexican skillet  it wasnt spici or even good  it was veri bland veri bore and veri lack all around  food suck and our waitress took forev to take our order and when she did she reek of smoke  so instead of serv us she was out back have a cig  at least wash your hand and pop a mint when your done so my nose isnt fill with stale smoke  price were high food suck  i also felt the interior seat was veri lacklust  had a cafeteria feel to it not cozi at allim not even go to wast my time with an in depth review of this place  the menu is generic and the food most repuls  guac dip monaco focaccia noth focaccia about it it was flat bread plain and simpl even the onion ring and fri were gnar and im irish and must eat potato with everi meal  the clientel was immatur obnoxi and way too drunk for 430 on a friday im talk connect sever straw togeth and walk around to other tabl to drink from their beer through the extendostraw  oh and take pictur of each other ass crack  the servic was miser i must have said no ranch dress about 10x and still somehow wound up with it and our waitress seem unabl to deal with the four tabl in her section nor had ani clue what the marin chicken was marin in  and for a sport bar my husband and i were liter the onli one in the place interest in ani of the game they were show though peopl were cheer suck suck for the aforement extendostraw chick

th onli possibl redeem thing about this place is that it is ridicul cheap for happi hour and their night special  but you get what you pay fori snub my nose at you zealous purist out there i like my chees steak bastard hold your chees whiz drop the beef and toss on some chicken and make sure to add veget yes veget blasphemi i know give me mushroom onion green pepper tomato mmmm in fact you could even hold the meat and i would be alright with that 

the hot sandwich at corleon are a happi medley of these two extrem for the purist there the philli origin and for us west coast blasphem there everyth from buffalo chicken to veggi sub the fri are pretti decent it take some real effortor neglectto fuck up french fri but the onion ring leav a lot to be desir 
 
ive tri a coupl differ hot sandwich includ the philli origin and it alway a greasi messi event the major of the time the juic and greas of the content melt right through the damn roll leav me with a pile of napkin a mangl sandwich and a frown on my face i realli dislik it when my food fall apart i usual bite of it as hard as i can to tri and inflict pain on the offend meal the food has never acknowledg my attack it a pretti irrat tradit so if keep your sandwich in one edibl piec is big in your book i wouldnt recommend this place 

the actual restaur is pretti small with a long bar with stool and sever high tabl to enjoy your vittl at it also a littl bit on the hot side sinc half of the restaur is the kitchen and it get a bit noisi with all the order grill and chit chat but it a realli live atmospher and they offer deliveri or take out if your in a hurri theyr open realli late too especi on the weekend in order to cater to the mill avenu night life

on tuesday they have a special that pretti ace it a buy one get one deal on ani sandwich in the placeof equal or lesser valu just imagin that in small printso you and a friend can eat for cheap or youv got one sandwich for dinner and anoth for lunch the next day

i know a lot of peopl that ador this place but it just not my thing chees steak are not the food of god to me but if the thought of hot beef and chees whiz has you gargl saliva like homer simpson youll probabl enjoy it and rate it higher4 star for the flavor jerk chicken veggi and bean over rice see photo abov taken sometim in may 08  

2star deduct caus by my wit a young adult male dress in athlet cloth who reek of bodi odor enter the front entranc and then proceed to enter the kitchen area to grab food for him and his companion  as if it wasnt enough i had to bat fli away from my tabl   but then again for a certain number of week out of a year it hard to keep fli away anywher  just visit the edr where i work

i shall not returnserious what the fuss over this place nostalgia becaus i was among the youngest patron yesterday and im push 40 

i met a new colleagu here for a busi lunch becaus he had just move veri close to arrowhead this locat is right around the corner from the mervyn with maci on the other side it was mall food not some awesom backeast deli i had a roast beef it had a decent amount of meat but nowher near the pic on their websit mayo lettuc tomato i could have made this at home with better tast unprocess beef from midwestern meat no option to toast the bread i person hate sandwich on untoast bread the fri were noth special the wrap cake slice were so smash they were complet unapp how long have they been sit there the man behind the counter of the bake good subsect was rude and weird but all the other staffer were pleasant last but not least i felt the price was way too high almost 12 for a meh sandwich fri and a larg drink with no tabl servic no thank miracl mileive never eaten a mouth of sand but if i did i cant imagin it would tast much differ than the rice and bean serv at taco del mar 

if it is the goal of tdm to produc the most bland tast mexican food on the planet they are do a pretti good job

in addit to the rice and bean not much can be said for their dri flavorfre steak as well  if your into eat cardboard i suggest you tri tdms steak taco youll be in heaven

id give the place one star if it werent for the friend employe those bastardsylvia is meh i realli dont have much more to say about it 

from the walk up and order servic to the salsa bar that children are allow to play in meh

now it not horribl it just not the best mexican ive had my last trip i had the green chile enchilada the chile was not flavor and i was left unimpress with their rice and bean 

mayb i need to go and order someth of the grill varieti and give them anoth shot right now i remain unimpress by sylvia and her canastai dont know how to drill it into my friend that ive met here in arizonapei wei and pf chang is  n o t authent chines food

iv gone here 4 time each with differ friend and gasp my husband this is the one place where he and i dont see eye to eye on i told him after my last time there if he want to go he will have to find friend to go with ill be anywher but there

 had their pad thai with chicken fri rice with shrimp ginger broccoli and asian coconut curryeach time ive been massiv disappointed

with their pad thai there was an over abundan of sauc that should not be soak into my food it was extrem bitter and a bit sour as well the chicken had been overdon  yuck

their fri rice with shrimp was ok even though i had specif ask that no scallion and no pepper be put in pepper in my friend rice  wtf it was bog down with far too much soy sauc for my like like they had liter soak it over night in soy sauc i could manag to eat half of it befor the soy sauc made me stop

th other dish were passabl but again i wont be go back here voluntarili i think id rather eat at california pizza kitchen befor ever set foot in here againactu i think i may actual go to rumbi befor pei wei

th atmospher wasnt so bad but it was loud the open kitchen and hear all the clatter of plate can get to you after a while merci the time ive been there were no scream children but ive heard horror stori from some friend that go there on a regular basi ive been lucky

i just could never get a feel for the place  i never bond with it mayb becaus it just never felt like fulli authent chines food

i cant quit put my finger on it but this place is way off for mei was on my way back from orlando and had a layov in phoenix  the flight was delay so it was time to fill my belli with food  i opt for asian food sinc i was eat theme park food all weekend  

i end up with the mongolian beef over rice and an egg roll  the egg roll was ok  but the sauc for the mongolian beef was way too salti  and there was a lot of sauc so it not like i could just push it to the side and just eat the rice  my mouth just felt so dri the rest of the night  if you decid to get this ask for less sauc or sauc on the sideit ok food the portion are small especi for chines food
i think they actual pour oil direct on the dish ive never had food this oili 
i do like that you can ask for extra won ton but they charg you 25 cent a won ton 

not veri good everyth tast the same

im also not sure if they use ani hydrogen oilive been to this locat dozen of time over the yearsal due to the fact that i cant get pan de sal siaopao and other similar item anywher in my hood but onc one open up ill be happi to part ways

i swear the owner ladi is rude on purpos she pretti much has no regard for anyon especi custom she saw me stand there with a basket full of stuff and she continu to sweep then sweep behind the counter for over 5 minut befor ring me up oh and there were 2 other peopl behind me in line no sorri no hello no thank you previous time shell talk on the phone and not acknowledg you if you tri to get her attent shell scowl and say wait wors time shell yell at her husband and creat a more uncomfort experi i had to walk out once

if i wasnt so lazi i would just drive a few more mile out to spring mountain but at this point i just expect a miser experience
if your as lazi as me and in my neighborhood dont say you havent been warned

on star sound fit but the store itself cram a lot of asian goodi at a pretti decent price in a small locat 2 reluct stardont believ the hype  
16 dollar for 4 skinni piec of salmon sashimi bogus if you are go to drop dollar dont do it here  it may be an awesom restaur for la but it didnt work for me in las vega 

reserv high recommend  even then hope for the best 
we had to wait over 30 minut for our food hungri it didnt help that we saw tabl seat after us get food befor us 
from what i gather everyth els that was order was good  the halibut fish special the ramen the chicken skewer and the sushi were delight  if it wouldnt of been for the the wait you may have seen 3 star from me  
if you are a parti of 6 or more 20 gratuiti will be automat tack on to your bill regardless the situat 

luckili for us our waiter couldnt refut the mistak and updat our bill  too bad he end up with a coupl of dollar but mayb next timea littl more communic or some chip and salsa pleasewel you know what i mean 

drink seem appet the bar staff was friend and the hostess was nice   my compani of 5 hot woman made up for my mealmy first review in over a month sorri ive been away for so long yelp now onto the review

cut place but look can be deceiv as we all know 

awesom view
loc on the second floor insid caesar palac sushi roku look promis becaus of the attract decor and beauti seat the place practic look like a loung oh and i forgot to mention that the view is pretti awesom 

our reserv were made for 10pm on a thursday night which i kind of thought was weird becaus they close at 10 but hey whatev 

keep on roll with the disappointments
w order at least 10 roll might have even been 12 but each roll that came out was just as disappoint as the next im not use to eat crappi sushi cant expect too much from a japanes restaur on the strip the last roll that came out had my friend want to spit it out they describ the tast as rosemari soap we sent the dish back becaus it was that bad needless to say i did not tri it becaus know me and my gag reflex i would have thrown up on the person sit across from me after eat that 

one star for the laid back ambianc and awesom viewso after i wrote a great review about this place i came back and was extrem disappoint with the produc i went in after work to get a few thing to make salad for dinner and i was serious appal at what i saw the bag carrot were slimi the few cucumb that were left were deform and bruis all the strawberri look brown and the prepackag fruit were expir right befor my eye the prepackag lettuc had like 2 day befor it expir and was turn brown you know that section they have in all store where the stuff is like 75 off or whatev caus it expir that day that was the qualiti of all the produc except they were still charg full price like doe anyon even check to make sure the item are of sellabl qualiti it certain didnt seem like it i will still shop here for other stuff but definit not produc fuck that shitmorton steakhous featur a 99 steak and seafood special so the big f and i took advantag of this offer for what we hope would be a fine dine experience

th restaur wasnt particular over busi this past friday as we were seat at our tabl  the waiter inquir about our beverag choic befor tell us about the menu  he soon return with a cart that held exampl of the cut of beef avail the veget that accompani it and other various dine choic  it can be a bit overwhelm as he goe over what the restaur offer but not to worri sinc it all on the menu anyway

they start you off with a larg loaf of bread and it doesnt matter if your dine by yourself or with a group you still get this loaf of onion bread  i did ask what they did with the leftov loaf hope that they might donat it or someth  no luck  into the trash it goes

for salad we both chose the morton salad with morton blue chees dress chop egg and anchovi  it a combin of romain and iceberg lettuc leav  it would help if they cut the leav down a bit becaus it was a mess to eat  the dress was alright noth special about it be their own blue chees dress  the anchovi ad the perfect salti but im sure the anchovi were not their own

with our special dinner of a singl cut of filet mignon come a choic of an appet  i went for the broil sea scallop wrap in bacon with apricot chutney  the big f had the jumbo lump crab cake with mustard mayonnais sauc  my scallop were good and what isnt good with bacon  the sweet of the chutney ad a nice contrast as well  the crab cake was pretti good too made with lot of crab and less filler  they could do a lot better though with the present of our meal  the big fs plate look like someth was miss  

howev the real problem we both had was with the beef  although it was perfect cook to how we order it rare it was ultim tasteless  now dont get me wrong  i had my share of filet mignon and im use to a smooth tast where the meat melt in your mouth and has you feel like heaven land in your mouth  this wasnt the case here  it wasnt just my opinion about this tasteless beef the big f was on the same page as well  we ultim had to ask for worchestir sauc to dous it so it had some flavor  it doe come with a side of bearnais sauc but ive had much better  perhap we should have said someth to the staff about our entre and yes that was our mistak  it was my first time dine at morton and i figur this is how they do their filet the big f usual get their cajun ribey steak when hes there so he had no previous experi with their filet mignon either

our choic side dish were the macaroni  chees with a hint of spice and lyonnais potato  the mac  chees was alright  i prefer it to have a smoother and creamier textur but this had that graini in it  the big f did like their choic of pasta for it though  the potato were pretti tasti cook with lot of onions

for dessert the choic were either chocol cake or key lime pie  well i wish i knew it was actual call morton legendari hot chocol cake becaus it was realli good  it had a molten center that was ooz out so nice when i cut into it  it was probabl the save grace of the meal  but becaus i had finish my tasteless piec of meat i was too stuf to finish my dessert and ice cream  in retrospect i would have brought the meat home and recook it instead  the big fs key lime pie was good too not as good as the chocol molten cake though  we probabl would have finish that as well if we had put the meat to the side

servic was good at some point  our beverag glass were never empti due to the water boy constant refil our glass  our waiter check on us onc dure our meal and that when we ask for the worchestir sauc  but i dont recal him come around much after that

overal my meal at morton steakhous was disappoint  perhap my tast prefer just dont align with how morton doe their filet mignon here  they have rave review so mayb it just my bad luck that i got a tasteless piec of beef  anyway i dont see myself come back here anytim soon though

they do have a happi hour and revers happi hour  it was advertis in the restrooms

p of our dinner are posti realli plan my way around this place for breakfast earlier than my usual i got here a littl after 7am becaus i had errand to run near by and plus ive had this place bookmark long enough

i ask the server what was popular she say mont cristo and the new england benedict i rememb this was on yelp quick tip list and the fri bread but ill get to that in a bit 

i chose to go with the new england benni becaus ive had a mont cristo befor elsewher the crab cake benedict was an egg benedict but the ham was subsitut with a coupl patti of crab cake instead clever and interest idea but i wasnt impress with it the crab flavor didnt do it for me the hollandais sauc was typic and satisfi the other half of the plate was fill with season potato they were edibl i just put a lot of ketchup and pepper on them i feel they were overcook 

the fri bread was a differ stori more like a night and day differ now this may had been one calori pack creation but it was worth tri it look like a loaf of bread powder sugar on top and mapl syrup sit on the bottom of it oh my fri good save room for this it fluffi with a sweet donut flavor the server also gave me a sampl of their pure mapl syrup to tast the differ the pure mapl had a lighter flavor and thinner consist the regular mapl was fine

serv was veri friend and courteous place look date and kinda run down olddirti carpet and light make it even wors and valu was ok for size  but fri bread was definit worth it 

i may tri the mont cristo and their mapl french toast if i ever go backin my opinion this restaur is way overr i was expect great as per all of the review journal write up etc total maximum let down i want the food to kick ass becaus it is close to my hous nope it aint dope 

fyi they wont accept the two for one coupon that was print in the 2011 entertain guid i learn they have a small sign on the door that say no coupon accept oop i miss that one on the way in could have save me an embarass moment when the waitress went into her rant that the entertain guid group put them in without permiss well shit if i own a busi i would honor it rather than make a potenti custom feel like they just comit a crime by present a coupon my bad i did not see the tini index card of a note on the door so sue me that is tacki anyway in my opinion

anyway now let get onto the food part

had breakfast omelett and countri potato with toast toast was over toast and my denver style omelett was drycom on realli um not impress my pal order pancak and sausag just ok i expect better than ok from a restaur that has as mani rave review as it doe i understand we order simplehowev if they are sub par on simpl meal i cant imagin the outcom of anyth els 

we ate we paid and will never look back

ther are too mani mind blow restaur in vega for breakfast to ever consid the mapl tree as an option

servic suck food mediocre

they have good coffe that was the best part of our meal which is not say much review is for spring 2013 restaur week menu 


first the food

th bread basket was brought a fair amount of time after i order  i was told there was honey wheat ciabatta white someth els and their homemad corn bread as you can see from the photo the basket was most corn bread which was good but anoth piec of bread was just plain

for the first cours  i order the potato leek soup with lobster sour cream dumpl and jalapeño bacon crumbl  the dish was present as a bowl with the lobster dumpl and bacon in the bowl and then the soup was pour from a server onto the ingredi list  i was ask if i want some fresh ground pepper  when i said yes the server began a hunt to find a pepper grinder  evid they had been put away from the day befor and hadnt been brought back out  the soup wasnt veri hot  the dumpl were the best part of the soup  i also like the bacon  as you chew it the jalapeño flavor was releas and left a littl heat in your mouth for the next spoon of soup

ther was no choic for the main cours  it was australian waygu strip steak with a bone marrow flan and some wine reduct  i order my steak black and blue  it came out medium rare  the steak look a bit like a rectangular hockey puck and it cut about the same  insid it was tender but the outsid was damn tough  the flavor of the steak was noth that id rememb past the immedi bite i was consum  it was bland also

cours 3 consist of two sidesasparagus and truffl pave potato  the potato were absolut the blandest thing i could eat  i ate the truffl piec that were on the top and enjoy that the most  pave potato is their slang for fanci stack thin cut potato slice with no flavor  the asparagus was ok  it was crisp and better than be cook until it soft and mushi  

for dessert you had a choic of cheesecak or cheesecak  the menu was differ from their restaur week menu onlin  the mascarpon cheesecak on carrot couli had some sorbet and pineappl piec  it was good  it was not the chocol peanut butter bar i was hope to order

th service

i was stun by the lackadais manner of the staff that serv me last night  i saw my waiter twice when i order and when he brought the bill  i saw the person who deliv bread and non alcohol drink 3 time onc with the bread and twice for ice tea  i saw a bus person three time when he came to remov dish  

the score for my pink wrapper test was 5050  one test was a fail and one was a pass  no one came by to ask how the meal was  i wait a long time befor the liquid person came to ask if i want some more ice tea  in short peopl just didnt seem to care  i had more convers and rapport with the young woman seat at the tabl next to me than i did the staff

when my server brought the bill i ask him to do me a favor  i ask him to tell the chef that medium rare was not black and blue  he hesit for a few second as if thing didnt connect and then said oh it was cook too much  he left the tabl and never said anoth word  it was then that i start to fill out the comment card someth i rare do  when the server came back with my credit card slip he curious remov the salt and pepper shaker from the tabl  did it look like i was go to slip them into my pocket

a for the ambienc of the place it was nouveau dark as this photo shows

httpwwwyelpcombizphotoscharliepalmersteaklasvegas3zr8uvgbvry2caghkqep4la

for some reason after i was there for about 15 minut the light came up half bright for about two minut and then went back down to this level  cozi romant and veri dark are all appropri word  what realli got me the most was look toward the other room and see the reflect of a basketbal game  it was come from the barloung  cant we do without tv in a restaur like this  this just bug me to no end  if i want to eat in a sport bar i would have

i realli was disappoint by this whole even  with so mani great steakhous on the strip i wont be return to charli palmerso i liter just left this flamingo locat in a bad mood as my boyfriend  i walk in were warm welcom with the nice hostess she seat us at a tabl that still has tip money from the last custom  no tabl set up 

i believ we had no particular server becaus the busser end up take our drink order after see us not be taken care of yet few moment later a server ask us for our drink order again then after that a separ server ask to take our food order 

mani minut later no banana muffin or food has been deliv i ask for vanilla creamer which i never receiv they must not have food runner either becaus my boyfriend can see his food sit in the window 

in a rush 45 minut later i ask for take out box when i final get my waffl they gave me runni egg when i specif said overmedium 

after my boyfriend box up our food he find a hair on his plate it couldnt have been his becaus his head is shave 

toward the end i ask if we could have lid to take out syrup home for my waffl i never receiv them

when i ask if we get banana muffin with our meal the server said onli if it come with the order or if it your first time now how would they know if it was our first time or not if no one ask us in the begin as a server myself for a differ restaur i know ask the custom if it is their first time is one of the first thing you ask when you greet them 

i gave eggwork 2 star this time and not 1 becaus i still do enjoy their food theyr alway busi so they should be use to the fast pace environ we were easi custom who knew what to order immedi did not complain verbal  still tip them as an egg work fan im realli disappoint and hope they can improv their servic cleanli and communicthe sushi here is tasti there is a larg select of bake roll for those who insist on sushi but dislik raw fish their nigiri is fresh and cut of fish generous their ayc is around 27 the menu is pretti extens and it is higher qualiti of sushi my favorit roll were kiss of fire and silver state

whi onli 2 star 

there were sever roll we order as well as an order of uni that never made it out in fact in the middl of our servic they stop come to take our order altogeth there were four of us all indulg in ayc when the server came by he mention that the chef were back up the restaur wasnt even half full this is where the greedi part come in they purpos space it so that we would eventu just get tire or decid we are full and leav to be fair they did comp our drink 750 due to the wait without us ask but that hard make up for not get sever roll we order yet sign for a 120 bill also the ladi bathroom toilet didnt flush big yuck

on the next visit boyfriend brother fianc ask me to go back with her i did and the greedi part was reaffirm and i am most definit not come back i initi didnt think id have much food so i didnt opt for ayc i order a cucumb salad and two roll not realiz that i was close to 35 alreadi now i had done someth similar at anoth sushi joint where i just order what i rememb i enjoy as ayc as a la cart and then had the waitress suggest that i should just go ayc becaus what i order was well over the ayc price i appreci that type of servic and look out for the custom instead of pocket extra 20 and lose 5 repeat custom 
oh yeah they also forgot one of my roll and we just sat around while they brought it out appar the chef thought they had alreadi fill that order the sheer greedi this place exhibit left  a horribl impress i am not ask for freebi but i also will not be taken advantag of their lack of custom focus cost them 5 certain repeat custom and probabl mani more peopl i would have brought there becaus the sushi is actual pretti good

it is locat in the buffalo wild wing park lot on eastern the park on weekend is a nightmarwhat happen to taco bell  it use to be one of my favorit guilti pleasuresit has fallen so far down my list i dont even crave it anymor  why

 becaus their portion are much smaller

 price increased

 qualiti of the food downhill

mi most recent visit the other day i order a 7 layer burrito 199 and 2 bean burrito 109  the bean burrito were the size of the one they sold a few year ago for 69 centsnow theyr 109  theyr freakin tini and unsatisfi  the 7 layer burrito has taken a huge hit in qualiti tooall of the ingredi tast blandblech  also taco bell has the habit of not put out their fire sauc for peopl to useon hot  mildand when you ask for some they give you 2 packet for each item  i can easili use up 4 or 5 per itemwhatever

overal valu  even though i spent less than 5 it was garbag  onli reason whi i stop by was becaus of old memori of good junk food

wil i return  eventu somedaybut not anytim soonyou know i dont ventur in to chain restaur often and even less often a chain steakhous  so how did i find myself at outback steakhous  it was a quick busi trip to vega  i was treat for dinner and they ask for steak and conveni  we were both stay at hotel well south of the strip so this limit the choic  noth on the strip is convenient

didnt i see an outback by the outlet mall  yes  weari busi travel settl for dinner

i must say i have not been to an outback in probabl 6 year  it was not as bad as i rememb  that would not make a great advertis slogan by the way

mi 6 oz sirloin was fine  the salad was fine  the servic was fine  by fine i dont mean fine dine i mean ok dining

se you in anoth 6 year outbackwouldnt you think caesar palac could serv a decent caesar salad i mean cmon a lousi caesar salad so have you ever notic how embarrass the other casino hotel are about have food court for the proletariat when you go to like the venetian it hidden away on a second floor at the bellagio you bare notic it give caesar credit that they put their front and center in the casino right near the colosseum main entranc door 

hell i didnt even know the place had a name but this is where jami w sat as the nongambl porker we are and ate a quicki meal befor both cher and bett midler now i never find anyth all that appet among the intern chain of kiosk but befor bett i decid to tri the shrimp caesar salad at one of them it came in the standard plastic bowl with the standard plastic minicup of dress i actual dont rememb much about it but i can alway count on the older asian woman in the countri kitchen outfit hand out toothpick and buse tabl ok that all i got 

food  2 starscaesar hath no caesar salad worthi of the palac 
ambianc  25 starsit a food court with fauxroman statueswhat dya expect 
servic  2 starssnaillik despit the throng 
total  2 starsserv it purpos for precher and prebett idl timewhat can i sayaft spend doremi on the show were cheapcypress street marketplac is a food court in the middl of the casino in caesar palac it veri conveni but id high recommend skip it as a food option

th atmospher is actual pretti cool tabl in the middl surround by differ food vendor it veri veri pricey for what it is though to give you an exampl i order a doubl chees burger with fri and a drink for about 23 now if the burger was good id have no problem with this place but the burger suck it realli did it look gorgeous but tast like a gas station burger

for the price id skip this place and head on over to one of the mani kickass restaur in caesar or the surround hotelif you advertis a breakfast menu and also advertis you open at 8 amsinc most employ peopl get their breakfast between 7am and 9 am i guess that make sensei see no reason whi youd have your door lock at 833am and wast my time and gasfirst impress this place is terrible

first of all let me give you a quick background on me i am half filipino from my dadso i have some knowledg about filipino food the problem is i am also half white and extrem extrem american lol that be said i know the basic of filipino food onli from eat at my grandma hous yummmmmm howev i cant prononuc anyth in tagalog no accent by look at me you cant even tell i am half so obvious come in they think im just some straight up white girl walk into their restaur 

when i walk up to order that when i realiz how rude the ladi was she was complet irrit that i was point at certain dish ask what type of meat it is i can onli point out  loganisa adobo annddd sinigang other than that i  have nooooo idea she had an attitud problem and all i want was some good food 

so this make me wonder do all custom have to have an accent and know the in and out of this type of food to come here in order to give good servic do i have to bring my grandma along 

it not like the ladi didnt speak english or didnt understand me she was just mad that i didnt know what was what 

ruuuuuuude

i would say i would never come back but the onli reason this place get 2 star is becaus their halo halo is bomb ill come back for that sinc i know how to say it lol

anyway food was mediocr or mayb my granni spoil me it was a big bowl of oil ok this is a review for their seafood  as ive never eaten steak there before

i use to love this restaur the last time i was in vega i stay for 3 month  i take a long vacat everi year about 2 year ago i went to joe probabl 5 time to eat kingston crab and shrimp and such it was amaz 5 star back then

thi time i have been stay in vega for over 2 month alreadi eat out everyday and night  spend a lot of  sad enough i have found qualiti of vega restaur busi has gone pretti bad mayb it becaus of the depress mayb theyv found easier way to get more money  like night club well whatev the reason was i decid to go to joe to refresh myself hope not to wast money anymore

servic  outstand they are the professionals

atmospher  3 star as alway not so special but it is all ok with me

food  

crab  not good anymor they are pretti much tasteless i dont know what happen to them simpli tasteless not worth eat it even if it 5

cevich  terribl it was amaz last time tho this time it was like stuf out of a cheap seafood taco made by hole in the wall type of place in la they dont even use cilantro and red onion they made it with some sort of salsa shrimp and scallop didnt have ani flavor they were just chewi thing without ani tast terrible

lobst  flavorless again it doesnt even smell like a lobster 

oyster  it is ok 2 year ago it was much better tho

w have to walk away as soon as we finish drink wine all we order was just appet  end up pay more than 100 for these small item 

i was gonna rate it 3 star for the servic but no i have to be honest becaus i dont want you to be disappoint dont get crab and shrimp this year they were say it was veri season fresh and good turn out to be pretti crappi mayb next year they may abl to find good seafood 


i was look forward to eat here for a while  so it was veri disappointtwelv dollar for a rum and coke that most coke 7 for a budweis how can i say no

easily

toss in a bouncer who was tri to screw us over say he wouldnt accept my pass and i had to pay 25 to get in   a crowd of thehotel patron some decent cool but most with a yah brah attitud which i never mingl well with top it off with a near dead danc floor and poor design lay out leav half the patron away from the back but crowd the front and the bar not uncommon

th onli reason i came here is becaus the yelp crowd choos this destin when sever of them decid to hit the casino floor i was right behind them

on star for the amaz view of the strip from the balconi a second star for the guy who use a line from roger dodger to tri and pick up one of my friend and was cool about it when i call him on ittower over the strip at the top of mandalay bay await a stun view and not much els  alain ducass mix offer littl more than a brilliant view and a uniqu decor  think eat insid a champagn bottl in a swedish furnitur store

befor get to your tabl you will walk through mix clubloung  this awkward ident crisi of an area is enough to throw off what could be a veri relax and luxuri ambienc  

the food was good not great  especi disappoint was the candi bar on the dessert menu  the cucumb sorbet was light breezi and refresh and certain the highlight of the meal  

even after the delici sorbet i left mix with a bitter tast in my mouth  

stop up for a cocktail and take in the view  it is far more satisfi than the foodi thought this place was sort of a rip off  we were approach by someon outsid the entranc about free cover even though there was no cover to pay  it was all kind of creepy

th foursquar page for this bar say that there are drink special for peopl who check in and the special are list on the page  when i approach the bar tender and show him my phone he was a big dick about the special and said it wasnt real  he was angri at me and said that they werent in charg of that page appar someon hijak it and was make thing up  i wasnt realli pleas with the guy attitud and then he was a dick to my group for the rest of the night

servic is super super slow especi if your outsid so dont bother stay here for a few drink  by the time your done with your first one youll be so bore that you want to leav and go somewher els for more drinks

th drink are also obvious pretti expens and they onli have standard cocktail noth uniqu or new  beer is insan expens and my coor wasnt even cold when they brought it out

th onli good thing about this place is the view which is pretti stun of the stripfirst dont know whi the yelp map show this locat be off sandhil road it on desert inn at the northeast corner of eastern

second it a starbuck like ani other starbuck mediums drive thru relat friend staff usual offerings

third everi time i stop in here they screw up my order now i do order custom drink but theyr not crazi i want a mocha i want it decaf i want it made with soy milk decaf soy mocha easi enough right appar not

last week i ask for this and the guy take my order forgot the soy part when he mark the cup i wonder if he forgot when he charg me anyway the one girl make drink i believ they were short staf by one made it i check it notic the omiss and kind ask her to remak it proper she did but this was alreadi after wait 10 minut for the first drink becaus they were understaf ok no problem stuff happens

today i stop in again they were fulli staf i mean there were easili five young women behind the counter one dedic to the drivethru so whi was the girl take my order at the regist wear a headset and seem distract focus here again i order the same thing decaf soy mocha no whip it was turn around in reason time  and wrong again miss the soy part do they not get a lot of order for soy in this hood i dunno so again i told the barista and even she remark oh they alway get your wrong um yeah so someon els remad it and  now they forgot decaf but i didnt have time to wait again for anoth drink i just left

and now i wrote this review get your act togeth starbuck at di and eastern im not come backi came here for saturday morn breakfast  it was pretti busi but we were seat immediately

th place is cover in new orlean soul decor which was veri cool but the seat was veri cramped

th menu was veri extens which lot of omelett options
i chose the mardi gras omelett stick to the theme the wife had the chicken fri steak breajfast  the kid had egg  fruit each breakfast came with choic of juic  bread i had the buttermilk spice muffin which was excellent

th kid food came out and he finish it befor we heard anyth from the waitress who said she was gonna check on it 5 minut later it was serv and it was cold

hav wait 304 0 minut alreadi it didnt take much to turn this situat wors my wife politley explain to the waitress it was cold  she would like it done over no problem the waitress apologized

10 minut later after everyon had finish the cfs reemerg this time hot but lack ani gravi after that was fix the check appear and shit hit the fan

2 cfs  999 each  we were charg for send it back

needless to say after a few word with the mgmt the charg were revers but we will not  be return not veri good custom servic at allcame in becaus it was close to home and they were run a deal with 10 off 30 even though it close to home we havent gone in mayb a year last time we had a posit experienceboy what a differ a year make 

hostess that sat us i think was cri her eye were red and wet mayb it allergi but if it notjesus somebodi give her a 10 minut break to cool down just heartless if the girl got some bad news or have a bad day and they just put her in the front to be the suppos to be smile first face you see 

we sat in a corner booth and the tabl was dirti and the drape decor in our booth was dusti there was this sewer smell that we couldnt quit place that was on that side of the restaur and was on and off we move booth and it wasnt as bad but you get a whiff sometimesshouldv leftshoudlv fuck left then 

bf got their summer 3 cours meal which you pick a soup or salad a entre and a petit dessert french onion soup okay noth special chicken asparagus ravioli the chicken piec were shred breast and was overcook the sauc had a flavor about itit was over season with oregano that you couldnt tast anyth els we start to get our food and that when the smell came back too should use the other side of the restaur if the smell is on this side of the place  dessert cinammon beignet w custard insid serv with chocol and raspberri sauc too doughi but was okay 

i got beef bourguignon it was good but this was no borguignon it pot roast with gravi and veget thrown on it they gave me grill asparagus on it which is a plus with me sinc i love em grill mash potato serv with it wasnt season  i got a petit treat of the bread pud this wasnt petit it was actual a pretti big serv it wasnt good dens dri and then the syrup which is normal yummi butterscotchi syrup was just syrup it didnt tast like anyth it was just sweet cmon even station casino one come with a vanilla custard and good syrup on it 

highlight of the meal for me was the free breadbasket i like their carrot cake loaf 

the servic was attent ill give them that our drink were refil we were check on now if the kitchen crew and clean crew can get with it food was not good and the place isnt deep clean so theyr slack off 

the bf was not feel it and left a bit annoy and not  want to come back 

now the kicker i just got home and threw up twice alreadi 

yeah were not come back nor let ani of our friend eat here i have a nose and throat infect develop so i feel like shit alreadi and no this kind of get sick doesnt make me throw up thank for make my day the wors it can possibl bei use to come to this place all the time in high school but recent shit got weird

i went here after work and sat up at the sushi bar there was onli one other person in the place but the waitress still manag to ignor me most of the time 

the chef were veri nice and that realli the onli reason i gave this place more than one star

mi utensil and dish were dirti i thought the sushi was pretti decent and okay until i went home and got sick yukeasi life boba is the onli place for now that serv up fluffi snow iceif you wanna call it that in las vegas

i will happili wait for good food done right

i will happili pay for good food done right

when you fail to execut what your sell and charg me out the yinyang on top of it

houston we have a problem

snow factori in hawaii doe snow ice like it should becheck my review and pictur to see the differ fluff ice doe their fluff like it should bejust like cotton candyfluffi in appear and melt in your mouth
i understand where peopl have an issu with the servic longer than necesari wait time becaus your attent span is with your friend that came in to chat while your on the time clock and not with the custom how bout more train to put the fluff back in your product

w order 2 small fluffi snow and a boba milk tea which came out to just under 16sm  525 lg 725 jumbo  925wtf for snow ice

w tri thai fluffi snow with rice cake tapioca and condens milk and the thai tea flavor was bare there we also got strawberri with mochi banana and lyche jelli and condens milk which they forgot to put the straw that broke the camel back was the textur it wasnt fluffi at all probabl becaus all the top crush the fluffi textur kinda like when you take a nice made cotton candi and smash the air out of it and wors of all it was alreadi meltingin an air condit room honest this version is closer to shave ice and nowher near snow ice might as well catch snow ono for some bombass shave ice and still have some  in your wallet seriously

i had fluff ice at the las vega foodi fest 3 time outdoor and it didnt melt as fast

yelp you have been warn so if you go here to tri it and come out disappoint or think that it not all that i dont blame you you arent get snow ice like how it should bealoha

yelp 365 challenge234365liquid cotton candi ummm nopei find the high rate for this place to be complet baffl mayb i came in on a bad night you know someon be off their game but i think 2 star is pretti generous if you ask me whi this was probabl the worst bubbl tea ive ever had ever

i was in the area and was check around for some new bubbl tea place that were closebi after see the high rate i decid to check it out the insid of the store is pretti nice it clean and well maintain thing start to go downhil after order a bubbl tea

larg milk tea w boba and egg pud and caramel let start with the boba it was not well cook it was mushi on the outsid and hard in the middl definit disappoint the egg pud was ghast it was way too soft by the time it get suck through the straw it disintegr into a cottag chees like textur i almost want to puke the milk tea had 0 tea flavor it might as well have been water and final the cherri on top would be the caramel they use the torani brand caramel syrup yes the same caramel syrup they use at starbuck to flavor their drink i mean come on it was terrible

it should have been 1 star but i gave them an extra star becaus the total was 4 buck with the yelp check in offer but not come backwhere the beef

   it amaz me how restaur could mess up such a simpl sandwich like a blt a blt is not exact a culinari work of art it is beacon lettuc and tomato with mayonnais on bread yet some restaur mess it up when i set eye on my panera bread blt or more like lt i was ask the exact question that the old ladi ask in the 80s wendi commerci where the beef in this case the beef was beacon what i saw was a few piec of ordinari beacon with lettuc and tomato on bread  the bread was compar to wonder bread which is iron consid that this is panera bread i was unimpress that there was not a choic of bread and that it was untoast the potato chip that i pick as the side was actual better than the sandwich  

  this is my second time at this panera bread a few week ago i dine here with shirley b the roast turkey  avocado blt that i order then was a tasti sandwich and i know that shirley like her soup but that doesnt make up for the atroc of a sandwich that i had tonight and for the record a good amount of it was leftov bread

  the restaur itself which is in the paseo verd parkway side of the district is a clean and attract dine environ the nois level is averag with some rock play in the background and there is suffici seat and lighting

 panera bread is on the dine level between fastfood and casual dine you step in line then order off the menu board after pay you bring a number to a tabl they bring you the food but you serv your beverag when your done they bus the table

  a blt give me an impress of a restaur and when a blt is so short of the beacon that it becom a lt it is leav me with a poor impress 

  i never say never i could return to panera bread mayb their special is bagel sandwich who know if i cross that bridg and return to panera bread and leav satisfi with a differ sandwich i can alway updat my review with a refer to this one after tonight sandwich color me unsatisfinoth person against nine fine irishmenthi review is more about all irish pub in general 

wtf is the big allur with irish pub drunk aggro mook swill darkass beer and eat grotesqu highsodium highfat carbheavi food in a frenzi fakeethn anim hous atmospher why

i was coerc into have lunch here the other day and it was gross i thought id be ok just order a good oldfashion cheeseburg littl did i know the irish appar slop garlic mayo all over everyth and even a simpl cheeseburg isnt good enough without ad a layer of some kinda weird fleshbacon on top of the regular meat patty

asid from the food i find the atmo at irish pub to be insuffer annoy all that dark wood panel hearti waitress manic jovial irish music blare from the jukeboxit my own privat version of hell secret fact about me i looooov holiday but on st patrick day i crawl into a hole and hide  all that green beer and all those drunk idiot make me want to vomit

th sole except to my antiirishpub stanc is osheasbecaus it more of a shithol dive bar than a pub they keep the wood panel to a minimum irish music is almost never play and my friend brian work the door in a leprechaun costum 

ill reserv my veri infrequ irishbar hanker for oshea with ani luck i will never set foot in 9 fine rí rá paddi macgillicuddi krazi oldtym potatonwhiskey shack again

ughi eat here at least onc a month against my better judgement but im alway hope for a finger in my chili i never tri ani of their new sandwich or anyth i stick to the chili it by no mean good but hell it less than 2 and it help everyth come out easier in the mornehhh my mom was crave chines food so i decid to give this place a go sinc i had a buy 2 get 1 free entré coupon call in my order and they said it would be readi in just 10 minut so that a plus fast food when i got there for some reason i had troubl find the main door lol i thought it was on the side somewher by nagoya ani way they didnt seem too happi that i had a coupon which by the way save me 10 so yay i wasnt realli hungri but i did sampl a littl bite of each entré 
chicken chow fun dri it was ok flat thin long rice noodl pan fri with soy sauc onion bean sprout  chicken
beef  asparagus way too salty
orang chicken it deep fri  coat with a sweet orang glaze of cours it tasti but so is panda express haha 
steam rice they gave us 3 larg contain of rice which was way too much but a plus sinc some place dont includ rice but the rice was a cheap qualiti rice
togo contain i like their plastic tupperwareish togo contain prevent spill and leakag and they are reuseabl haha 

anywho this place is not realli worth check out the price arent even that low for take out qualiti food

hot tip look in your mail for valpack coupon that where youll find their buy 2 get 1 free entré coupon1st to review i guess that realli no surpris word get around that this place is bad

it been quit awhil sinc ive been to burger king most becaus they microwav everyth right in front of you an then tell you it was charbroil i was lure in by a cowork will to pay and want to tri the new funnel cake sticks

i stay away from the burger sinc they are frozen patti semibroil then microwav not my kind of burger i do howev enjoy an occassion chicken sandwich microwav or not i order it my wayplain

th chicken sandwich was ok but the funnel cake stick were terriblelik a vanilla flavor straw made of straw i couldnt eat them neither could my son

a place i wont be back to for anoth long while and that not even due to the terribl servic we experienc take more than 20 minut for 3 chicken sandwich  2 funnel cake stickrealli i had to make reserv for this place becaus on a saturday night over labor day this envi the steakhous was complet dead there was one other tabl in there when we left there were mayb 5 we had a restaurantcom coupon so thank good we didnt pay full price for this place becaus i wouldv rather taken my money to flemings

our waiter was this super mellow guy and was realli nice he did pay attent to detail becaus he knew we didnt want ice in our water and made sure he didnt accident pour it in when it came to refil it the littl things

wel the big thing was the price we order the 10 oz filet mignon to share between us for 45 and paid a 5 split plate charg 45 are you kid me we start with the gnocchi which had wild mushroom and parmesan fondu which was pretti good we also order the steam broccolini the steak was definit not worth the money becaus the outsid was cook to a slight crisp not a problem for me becaus i like a bit of char but the insid rang from wellcook on the side to cold red center which is not good a wellcook filet order medium rare is a cool pink throughout what i also didnt like was that they cut the steak in half for us and brought it out on two plate just becaus we split it well it probabl didnt get to cook enough sinc you cut the sucker open and it got colder by the time you brought it to the tabl 

what was good was that your entre come with a small crock of mash potato and roast season veget which was yummi that a nice addit consid most steak place just give you a steak a la cart 

they had forgotten the steam broccolini and didnt bring it out until we ask for it we had a wine from their seven for seven list which was pretti good for 7 the ambienc was veri hotelsteakhouselik i still felt like i was in a hotel and i thought the decor was tri a bit hard to be on a more upscal than what it realli was at least i didnt have to dress up to eat here they didnt balk at my track suit jacket i had with me becaus i was too lazi to pack anyth dressi for the trip 

so glad we didnt pay full price for it it was bare worth it even with the coupon i do not have steak enviwhat the heck am i miss here  the rice again was ooey and gooey again on my last visit stick to the roof of my mouth and have a waxi feel about it   i guess some peopl like it that way   i was hope that it was just a fluke the first time but now also the second time  other peopl review i trust give it more star  i just dont get itate here month ago  was excit to final find a phoenix sushi venu and one that also offer brown rice as a sub for sushi dish dont quot me on this howev sinc it has been mani month and i may be recal anoth venu  

one item did impress me and that was the complimentari appet that was compris of tempurad chip with perhap a squid salad top   i should have just order anoth serv of this  instead i tri an ao yasai mix gourmet green with ginger and a sushi roll w brown rice the latter i thought was pricey consid the veri small portion given  i was so unimpress by it unexcit flavor that i dont even recal what kind of roll i tri  pretti sad i know  

i told myself i wouldnt go back but i would like to give hana anoth tri perhap for lunch andor dinner with a group of friend and have app and winesaki have had good and bad experi at hana in the past and overal i like their sashimi choic but last night was the final straw the wait staff is veri hit and miss with most be fun and friend but a few be the typic cooler than thou hipster wannab type that seem to plagu central phoenix restaur these day 

i can overlook the byob which honest i find annoy in a sushijapanes restaur sinc i love an ice cold martini with raw fish and the sometim attitudey servic and even the hohum roll offer noth special realli but what i cannot overlook is the ridicul overpr item and the blatant overcharg my partner and i were go to order the oyster and when we were told it was 9 for 2 oyster we polit declin with more than a bit of amus 2 oyster realli durant which has amaz fresh oyster present incred and is one of the priciest restaur in the area charg 13 for a half dozen in a far better atmospher 

ok so then i order the chirashi bowl which appar is not on the menu but they will do it anyway i alway get the chirashi as it is my favorit item at sushi restaur and hana doe a veri nice one inde for 35 of cours you dont know this until after you get the check sinc it not list anywher i understand that i order it and i should have ask but honest i have order this a hundr time from sf to la to ny and even at hana befor and have never seen it more than about 2022 local it goe for 19 at stingray and 17 at sakana which btw is much better 

anyway i have never in my life complain about food price befor so it is a littl weird have to write this but i truli feel hana is fleec peopl and sinc they were the onli game in the area for a long time they think they can get away with it  well see what happen now with stingray open up nearbi and moira downtown along with a few other newbi schedul for open in 2010 competit is a great thing 

some advic for sushi lover it a bit of a drive but sakana is still hand down the best sushi in town with a full bar and dinner for two in the 50 rang includ drinklong overdu review we went here 15 month ago with a 25 restaurantcom certif 

i want to like this place i realli did the wine was fantast the servic was fabul wish i could say the same about the food 

they dont seat peopl earli so we were seat a few minut after 8 no problem we were hang out at the bar anyway 

we were greet with a smile and individu pack crunchi bread stick awesom 

we order a chees plate with five varieti it came with three dip sauc i prefer the chees without the sauc mayb that just me 

weve heard great thing about the prosciutto ball an order come with six it salti veri salti didnt go down well at all 

then we had the crispi duck more like burnt overcook duck with no flavor except char meat and there was bare ani meat 

the goat chees pizza did littl to salvag the meal but it was the better of the three dish 

overal i was thorough disappoint how did mario batali becom an iron chef if these are the product that his restaur come out withanyon who is lose their hear but refus to use a hear aid will assum everyon els is deaf and speak at about 200 decibel  and of cours 300 decibel is requir when talk on a cell phone which is perfect accept in public  coco i would like you to meet my stepfath  he will be dine with you whenev im involv  feel free to provid consist crappi servic  judg by my last two visit that shouldnt be a problem

i would say the food at this locat is general decent  and i would say the server are general friend and pleasant  unfortun it will take repeat attempt to get your order right

i ask a server onc if he thought he should write our order down  he joke said no then came back 5 minut later to say he forgot what someon at our tabl order  he did a nice sale pitch on the sweet potato fri then brought regular fri anyway  but he was so person i didnt hold it against him  on my visit last week four tri to get the breakfast order right  suppos caus by a manag insist on help the wait staff by bring out order  seem more like an attempt to turn tabl quicker  i guess it backfired

end resultnot  a bad place if your will to wait or eat what they bring you rather than what you orderive been back a few time sinc the last review but the most notabl was to see dj ztrip he was awesom no complaint there

bar smith though they fail on so mani level 

i got there sometim between 1030 and 1100 and there was about a 20 minut wait out front not the end of the world or anyth but after final get in there was a sea of bodi and anoth veri long wait about 50 peopl were line up by the stair case wait to get upstair there was a bouncer not allow anyon up there until peopl would slowli trickl out whi they put ztrip on the patio i dont know it the size of a shoe box and was clear to capac befor 11 pm fail fail fail fail fail 

i was in various line rough 50 minut and still hadnt made it upstair forget about step out of line to get a drink becaus youd lose your place the short of it is i paid for pre sale ticket manag to get there at a decent time and still had to wait close to an hour just to get in the same room as the guy it was a total let down 

at that point i was so readi to just walk out and ask for my money back they clear oversold the event and didnt give much thought about their patron who paid money to see this dj they were go to fit everi last bodi into that place if it kill themand everyon els in there 

after final get upstair there were so mani bodi no one could move at all it was a total clusterfuck i final made it to the back bar and stood in line for 10 minut just to find out their card reader broke earlier in the night fantast no sign say it was a cash bar that would have been a nice gestur 

also the bathroom were downstair so forget about have to pee at all dure the 2 hour your there if you had to go you better hold it otherwis youd be wait in line for anoth 30 minut just to get back up 

bi the time ztrip came on the sound was bass heavi and mild distort i inch my way to various part of the patio but the sound didnt get ani better so my partner and i said fuck it and went downstair for the rest of the night thank they were play his set downstair and upstair at least peopl could move more easili downstair plus the sound was better and the bathroom were actual access 

even at the end of the night there were peopl stand in line wait to get upstair bar smith get a huge f as far as im concern i wont be back to this place for ani headlin dj they obvious dont know how to run an eventi want so bad for barsmith to be a hangout for my friend and i it right downtown it got two differ danc floor they play good music it draw a suppos hip crowd and they have a rooftop bar  unfortun they fail on so mani level 

first off to get to barsmith you have to walk past a sketch as hell nightclub full of dude mean muggin you and chick with skin tight unattract short dress hollerin for attent  oh yeah and all of the bum line up beg for chang that harass you until you get to the door when i walk in the door last night the foul odor of vomit piss sweat and fart near blew me back out it was almost unbear  and the clich hip hop music with the djs hype man yell all the singl ladi let me hear you so all of the guy knew which chick were horni and avail for the pick thank they separ the two part of the bar and we took the stair to the top to find it complet pack with more obnoxi drunk people

electro music bang from the speaker and peopl were chat it up i made my way to the bar onli to discov one bartend and no more cherri vodka i was substitut skyy vodka for the same price as 3 oliv  and redbul brought two drink to a total of 17 fuck dollar  who are you tri to be barsmith 850 for a redbullskyy and the bartend pour skill suck becaus the drink tast aw and were way too weak not even fill to the top

and to top it all off there was some creepi as fuck drunk as fuck 40someth year old heterosexu white male get all up on mine and my friend shit be a drunk fool and secur was nowher to be seen i saw a group of guy acknowledg and encourag his stupid ass drunk behavior as well  ive been to barsmith a coupl time befor and experienc the douchebageri of a lot of the guy that go here whether it discrimin base on sexualitygend or just them be plain macho jack up asshol it like the scottsdal ed hardi douch vibe in downtown pseudohipst form

real realli disappointreallypeopl like this place

it bad enough when the bartend cant make a drink correct the first time  vodka and tonic mind youand i think i onli tast tonic water  when you go back or in this case robert m took it back for me sinc the bartend ignor me the first time i tri the drink tast 10x worse

mus was good thoughyou know there a problem when the guy are separ from the ladi for pat down and purs inspect at the front door was i be arrest or is this common check in practic at this establish the door staff seem to find pleasur in boss patron around and may be take their hostess author a littl too far there noth special beyond the threshold here either the venu cocktail qualiti and staff all tragic fail the onli glimmer of hope rest on the ghettotast music that lead to contagi head boppin  bootti shakin  the music was great and is the onli reason whi i give two star but i dont plan on ever returnif i were to rate this place base on the food alon i would give it a 45 the shrimp was realli good with the signatur hot and juici sauc even better than what ive had at boil crab gasp my friend and i share deep fri soft shell crab catfish and fri which were all realli yummy

what brought it waaaay down for me was the horribl servic we went to eat there on a saturday even so we were expect it to be realli busi but it wasnt thought that would be a good thing becaus our server would probabl have more time to be attent but no my friend mouth was on fire from the spici sauc and had to ask for a coke refil 4 time befor a differ server final came and refil her cup i had to ask for water 3 time my other friend plastic bib broke and she had to repeat ask for anoth befor someon final brought her a new one

when i receiv my bag of shrimp there was a hole in it and juic were leak everywher i polit ask the server if i could have anoth bag just to place the one i alreadi had insid becaus i didnt want to lose all the sauc to my tabl and he repli with a horribl attitud tell me i wouldnt need one becaus it would be messi anyway i then repli with can you just get me a bag like i ask for pleas and he proceed to throw his hand in the air say fine in a veri sarcast tone and just threw the bag on the tabl um excus me first of all i want to save my delici sauc for my rice not for lick off the fcking tabl dick i wish i order crab instead of shrimp so i could use the claw to attack him

overheard the tabl next to our complain about the bad servic and the unnecessari attitud as well i hope the manag at this establish figur out a way to proper train their employe to be help attent and polit until that happen i wont be return to hot and juicicame in for a quiet sunday breakfast with the bf locat dine room is clean and welldecor with bright and cheer color and the fresh fruit salad and parfait on display in the refriger case are eyecatch and make a good healthi impuls purchase

bf work night and is a heavi eater in the am while i usual dont have an appetit at all until the afternoon he opt for the grill chicken sandwich from the lighter side section of the menu 13 while i kept it simpl with a peachberri smoothi wish the calori count for the smoothi was list too as i found it odd they werent list in the lighter side section but the freshsqueez juic were with counts

mi smoothi came out first and was flavor and most creami just a touch ici portion was good and i like that it came with the dome bubbl lid so that the portion was not cut short by snap on the flat lid as they are often serv elsewher noth more annoy than see a giant fresh smoothi be pour from the blender onli to have a heap of it get toss out becaus it doesnt fit in my cup

bf sandwich was next plate with a side salad with balsam dress salad veggi were fresh and dress tast homemad the sandwich though we had mix feel about it was top with grill veggi eggplant and roast pepper and the veggi themselv were delici the chicken was in two small flat piec and was fair dri while the flavor was fair good this simpli was not a 13 valu for a sandwich what we receiv did not justifi the price have seen the product this is not someth i would pay over about 8 for

i love to support local busi and especi one that offer healthi option but it realli frustrat me to see place jump on greenhealthi trend and jack up price an unreason degre when their product doesnt justifi iti have been to mani a deli my friend and this is not a veri good deli the kosher style corn beef they attempt was fatti some of it was chewi and part of it had been expos to the air too long and gotten a bit hard 

i also suggest more train on the deli equip befor someon is in need of stitch from the slice wheel the girl make my sandwich was have a hard time as a result of the previous mention hard portion and near push her finger into the wheel befor decid to shut it off while she fuss over the meat 

i like to watch someon fuss over meat as much as the next guy but no one should lose a finger

th potato salad was veri bland

rath than leav me with a fond memori of deli i have been to in nyc boston cleveland etc it left me wish i had skip it and want the real deal even moreok so it time to light pho avina fack ass on fire  i rememb go here when just the old ladi ran the joint  she was top notch the food was good she crank out one hell of an avocado boba  those were the day parti peopl those were the days

now let me compound thing a bit  i am talk ton of shit to my co worker about how i love vietnames food and that you just cant get a good nuoc mia ninh kieu in phoenix obvious tri to be a food badass cuz i am and pho avina goe and sucker kick my shit in the ballz

pho avina just got put on notic  i use to eat there becaus i thought it was a cool littl authent vietnames joint  i dont go in for mass consumpt shit70710

dont get me wrong i still love jfg i just didnt care for it bbq pull pork sandwich and fri  the coleslaw was good but not so fantast that it worth the pain after  i thought that the pork had too much of the cloyinglysweet sauc  wasnt so sweet when pair w the garlic toast point  howev if you look at the includ photo youll see that the two piec of bread were under the pork and therefor complet satur w sauc  i like accompani bread to be crispycrusti love that crunch so all i had to enjoy that afternoon w the pork was the part that stuck out from under all that sauc meat  what a wast tsk tsk  the boat of fri was just a complet soggi mess  i shouldv ask them to sub sweet potato fri instead but whi must i pay extra to get a perfect crisp product  then again one woman treasur is anoth woman trash and viceversa eh

today wasnt a great day for me w regard to mr johnston two restaur see my recent coffe shop review  i hope my next visit to a johnston concept yield a happier adventurwhen you are in vega most of the place you would want to eat should have great food on the menu but sometim they fake it and tri to make it but it realli doesnt catch on 

this ocean one bar look like an upscal place and the menu look like they would have great food but it turn out that the menu is a lie and that the food is just plain ewwh 

ye i said ewwh how to describ that is a place you should not ever tri my guy had the burger and i had a bite it was a semi decent patti but still probabl bought from a store in the freezer section 

i got some pasta that i dont rememb but it was pretti much on the hard side with a load of chees 

our servic wasnt good and we wait realli long for the check to even come to us i hate when place make you wait forev 

the onli cool or good thing about this place is the nice seat and also the buy one and get one free drink the food isnt good and i would say just skip itbeen live around this place for sever year and never notic it until i saw a small sign on the side of the road that caught my eye well even with the sign just a block away point to the shop it was block by anoth build that made it difficult to spot go south on jone blvd

disappoint orders

egg benedict a pretti straightforward dish that consist of english muffin layer with a slice of canadian baconham poach egg and the most import  hollandias sauc what would make or break the dish would certain be the hollandais sauc well from experi with more than a hand of differ version of egg benedict dish ive had in the past their sauc wasnt great or even good in my opinion the home fri potato werent ani better

ortega burger came with chili grill onion pepper jack chees and jalapeno mayonnais i didnt think i couldv gone wrong with this one but it wasnt near as satisfi as the descript the meat was on the dri side the chili was blah and i didnt notic anyth special with their jalapeno mayo spread fri were fine better than anyth els offer this morn id rather have carl jrs  santa fe chicken sandwich over this ani day

servic was great price werent good for qualiti nor quantiti decor was island casual and food was lack in all aspectsummari stingi on the feta chees and too much use of dri spices

w start off our meal with a hummus app and 2 glass of hous wine onli 199glass dure happi hour mf 47pm no complaint about the wine and the hummus was decent

next up we receiv our greek salad not much feta in the salad not much cucumb not much green pepper i think there was one in mine

for the main cours i order up the greek spaghetti which is one of my favorit greco dish again i was subject to the attack of the miss feta as they spars grace my plate with a few block of the good stuff the pasta also had a good amount of dri spice mix in with it which wasnt veri pleas to eat

i realli want to like the greek patio especi sinc it close by to my hous but due to the issu abov ill be stick with the golden greek and my big fat greek restaur it worth the drive for meim realli sad

th peopl that onc own en sushi have sold the busi so what was onc a good qualiti veri afford japanes joint has been convert to yet anoth subpar neighbourhood sushi restaur run by peopl who dont know japanes cuisine

let me give it to you straight if see a menu that has roll that have 12 ingredi on it run far far far away 

although my husband and i didnt order ani roll our companion did the roll were the circumfer of the bottom of a coke can top with all these ingredi how can all the individu flavour come through what was the chef think well obvious soak it a dish of sauc is an obvious answer to this question if it wasnt messi enough alreadi it sure was one hot messi meal then

thi is not sushi i dont have a name for this atroc but it certain is not sushi

if the legit of this place didnt plummet right then and there it hit the proverbi rock bottom when they serv the paper thin slice of sashimi cut incorrect insid im cring becaus we told our pal that this place was good

tempura was over hard and thick and wasnt near as delici as it was from my previous review plus they serious cut down the portion size from my last review

and a final note they no longer have the ongo offer for free food either that i mention previous even if they did we will not be returnweak we took a coupl there for dinner recent for a special occas the servic deterior through the meal which was ok at a few point even good my main issu is the servic our waitress was inattent and anoth server step in a few time to fill drink and provid for my unreason request like a plate to eat the damn appet off befor we finish our 230 meal they start sweep clean the kitchen move chair and bar stool and general make it clear they want us out befor both sever sat down at the bar to eat their dinner and start text take the hint i suggest we leav and when i check my watch i realiz they were open for anoth 20 minut plus i live liter a block away but would rather drive to richardson or anoth place that doe not rush you out on a friday nightit taco time yeah right  just let you know right now not my idea to come here  but it was a cowork time to pick lunch and he swear by this place whi you ask i even want to know  well this is the onli taco time in las vega and he grew up on this stuff back in utah big dealnow let me eat  

noth on the menu was appeal to me both tast wise and calori wise i end up pull up the myfitnessp app and found someth decent  i end up get their crisp chicken burrito  i know their known for their burrito i just didnt want to indulg know that a big dinner was within a few hour  their crisp chicken burrito is basic a larg deep fri taquito in my opinion  tast okay but that about it 

as for the ambianceyeah right  this taco time is locat at a truck stop off blue diamond across from from the silverton casinohotel  when your in here you almost forget your in las vega  for a minut i thought i was in barstow or even baker  servic wasnt the best and they didnt even have fork  good gravyi doubt i will stumbl back in here70110

ive had torta el guero bookmark for a coupl of week when a friend told me of the wonder torta she had here recent i thought id visit it on my next day off  came in prior to 430p and the woman man the counter could not speak ani english at all  good thing i still retain a littl of basic spanish to request that a few ingredi be omit  had i wait till 5p id have no problem w the bilingu caucasian server that arriv  

chose the carn asada torta and the bread was good  howev the fill was veri spars  i suggest that teg either use smallers bread or up the fill a bit  the cost of the sandwich is definit too high i wouldnt order this same sandwich for that price again especi when i could order a huge serv that is equal as tasti perhap more so at phoenix ranch market the telera bread there is amaz  inde i had to order two side taco for their meat content pastor y carn asada to be abl to fill in the rest of the torta   base on what i tri if i were to come back id order the pastor  i dont think ill be back though

i will howev visit the michoacan ice cream parlor again next door  the coffe and mango flavor i tri were delici  what i wouldnt do to have some of the coffe right nowwas over at manhattan fish grill and my wifey couldnt help but notic the big word cupcak across the park lot so off we went as soon as we were done with lunch

sinc we have never been there we found out that their specialti was make custom cupcak made to order right in front you basic they have cupcak alreadi made for you to pick out and add whatev to your liking

so we went with the chocol cupcak and had them fill it with white chocol crème top off with java frost the total came out close to 4 bucks

what happen next was pure disappoint wifey took one bite and said it was way too dri i tri it as well and verifi her claim i think even on her wors day my wifey could of made a better cupcak we should of took a bite befor we left so we could of either got a refund or at least anoth replac in hope that it would be better

so for the price and qualiti it was not worth it the onli good thing that came out of it was that the mini strawberri cupcak that were on sampl were actual pretti good mayb we were given an old cupcak mayb it was just bake that way all i know is that we ate onli half of it and my wife love her sweet but she said she could not bring herself to finish it not come back ani time sooncome on  realli  just becaus oprah think there great doe not make them so  mine are better and they come out of a box and you dont have to wait in line for an hour 

i visit cupcak at there bever hill store and thought they were ok  but noth to write home about  in fact they werent moist enough

when i saw the one that open near fashion squar all that came to mind was realli  whi  and how the hell can there pay the rent sell cupcak  hey i am not hatin just askoki am go to say thisi am extrem disappoint in sprinkles

i tri my first sprinkl cupcak back when they first open  thank you veri much sarah g i thought the cupcak was amaz  but i am now think this was just way to suck you in  the reason whi i say this is the last 2 time i had cupcak from sprinkl i did not have the same amaz experience

simpli put  the frost was goodi cannot complain therebut i am not a frost fan i am a cake fan  the cake on the cherri blossom and the lemon cupcak was dri  i gave my manag at work the red velvet  she also said the same thing frost great cake dri  then she ask me how much i spent on the sucker and she was floor   325 for that  insanpublic enemi say it best  dont believ the hype

 driven to the la sprinkl store and refus to stand in the ridicul long line  i heard everyon spout that this is a good place  or that they heard about this place on the tv show the girl next door  

fortun ive had more than one cowork give me cupcak from one of their store  but the day old cupcak was a bit dri i wasnt over impress 

mi sister whos studi to be a pastri chef and happen to make awesom dessert want to tri them  so we head out in search of a fresh moist cupcak  amaz enough the line here at this sprinkl were not omfng long like la  onli 8 custom in line  but that could be becaus it was hot as hell outsid  

the one gal that took our order was realli friend  the other 3 were just as pretti as can be with smile that never reach their eye  as i was the last one in the line rush i overheard a girl say whew  that was pretti crazi   realli now  8 custom crazi  suuuur dont ever get a job a starbucks

i paid 36 for a dozen pretti look cupcak  3 a pop  flavor  red velvet carrot chocol marshmellow peanut butter chip and vanilla  i was bum that a few of the flavor i want werent avail  appar they make certain flavor cake on certain day  our order taker wrap the box in a ziplock plastic bag and recommend that we didnt put them in the refriger so they wouldnt dri out  seal in a bag they would last a coupl day sit on the countertop

th verdict  some of them were good  other eh  the favorit be red velvet carrot and peanut butter chip it could be just the ice  tasti  but im not sure they were worth the 3 a cake

id probabl just go back to tri the mocha but i wont be a regular  realli not worth the pricei like cupcak regardless of their popular you can do all sort of thing with them decor build a pyramid and they fit right in your hand and are fill for their size ive had some good cupcak in my time sprinkl isnt on that list  see i think that sprinkl as a compani doesnt realli like cupcak i think they like the fact that they can bank on a fad their shop is veri sceney which is the antithesi of the happi cupcak time i want to experi it the kind of place an anoerex would go and gaze fond at the cupcak and then leav not have eaten anyth 

i went in and was immedi greet by multipl employe and was explain their rotat cupcak stock system and told that their red velvet cupcak were the most popular i ask them if they use real beet to color the chocol cakethey just gape at me then each other final someon came up with noo we use red food color well thrill fyi european studi are consist show that a number of red food dye interact with children endocrin system caus migrain and adhd symptom and red 3 has even caus tumor in mice 

anyway the magic of red velvet is the earthi play the beet offer not just the color so i skip that and when for lemon ginger 351 is 351 but this better be a realli good cupcak here we go the frost has the onli flavorlemon extract that is it is sweet the way i like my frost but a littl crunchi and crystal from sit out all day the cake was like moist cardboard i mean that in the best way of cours  the cake was fine but had zero tast that was where i was expect the ginger kick when i finish it i realiz that i was expect ginger the root when the real goal was the ginger flavor of box cake which are two total differ world

wher you ask

two word urban cookies

drop micmayb im miss someth but this art walk was low on art high on some pisspoor lunch truck and snack vendor i thought it sucked

i was realli look for the art and the walk part of it  it was veri small and most remind me of a high school carniv  was i in the wrong place

i was card when i came in by a kid around 17 who never remov the cigarett from his lip as he spoke to me we saw some musician busk but they were so close togeth it was most just nois and peopl run into each other

ther were some adult a hand of older peopl and coupl but most high schooler in a lot of eyelin and hoodi wander around smoke and say fuck a lot

im no prude  ive done all those thing  but it just wasnt the environ i was expect base on the websit descript 

onc a month the pedestrianfriend street transform into a huge block parti dure first friday each celebr the entertain shift and multipli as ice sculptor fire breather and fortun teller serv as a backdrop for this ongo festiv of art perus and appreci local band perform throughout the even and the street turn into canvass for children young and old to decor with chalk first friday is a stage for local galleri and las vega vital downtown cultur scene it a place to meet friend new and old and rejoic in the preserv and innov of an histor neighborhood in this land of suburb and strip mall visitor come from near and far to peoplewatch sampl new restaur and revel at area bars

hug was an overstat i didnt see one fortun teller fire breather ice sculptor restaur or bar i saw a littl art a talent cartoonist and some cheesi postcard  i saw a mediocr comedian who seem out of place

i honest saw no art galleri mayb one if that funki hous thing on the corner was an art gallery

wher was the beauti streetscap they mention  we felt like we just were encas in a littl culdesac between some garag and some rundown shops

i love local histori local cultur i love old i dont mind rundown but it didnt live up to the hype

im convinc we must have been in the wrong place or there was a lot more we didnt see  but we couldnt get past all the teen and there were no sign or inform about where to begin or how to get there or where to park or anyth  so we just guess and follow the peopl and left after do one lap and eat a smash chipwich

i like wont be back unless someon can tell me where to beive been twice not a fan that pretti much sum up my experii was veri excit when my plan open up and my famili and i were abl to go to first friday

mi excit didnt last through the entir night 

i went to their websit to tri and deciph which lot to park in how the shuttl work and blah blah blah navig down town is difficult as it is we final found park that was close to the event they charg 10 wowza

a lot of the artistscam off rude a lot of them didnt even say hi when we walk up to their booth what a turn off what would compel me to buy your overpr art when you dont even have a decent personality

when you are look for someth to eat make sure you walk all the way through the event we settl on the hummus factori truck becaus we didnt see the other one and were slight disappointedther were more promis one across the street

ther was some odd show go on this chick had flame baton and was belli danc to a slipknot sound song later a zombi came in and it turn into a zombi fire fight we walk away ask ourselv w t f did we just watch

so okay food elementari school look art and random music playing

remind me more of a swap meet than anyth els i dont know if we will be backthis event is overhyp and is noth but a hipster infestation

th amount of galleri to look at arent much and half of them have a snobbi feel to them some of the street vendor can be like this as well

park is absolut hell and you must park far away from the event it will take a while to even find park sinc downtown is so convoluted

howev a tip is to park at the las vega academi student park area you wont get tow for this besid there some student present who have to stay late a night for theatr rehears plus lva itself promot first friday to it student particular the art major so feel free to park at lva if you dont mind walk a bit to the event

th food sold at first friday is overpr although they do have veri good funnel cake still though i suggest you save money and eat at ani of the nearbi restaur instead you get more bang for your buck that way

consid the type of event first friday is youll find all sort of peopl dress in eccentr fashion it got everyth from goth to rockabilli chick it a great place to go peopl watch and even get some photo ops

regardless first friday still has a lot to improv upon as vegass local art scene we realli dont have much cultur here at all so thing like this are essenti to keep the art alivi use to travel to phoenix for work which was one of the benefit of that job  this restaur in downtown phoenix came high recommend by sever of the secretari i was work with and sinc it was in walk distanc of the offic i decid to give it a tri  

to be total honest it suck  complimentari bread and soup was serv for starter  the bread was stale and ive had better soup out of a can  the server was so busi flirt with the tall and veri tan ladi at the tabl next to me to pay much attent to the rest of his custom  he spent a good deal of the time ignor me i was constant have to ask him for thing i shouldnt have to ask forsuch as a fork or a drink  

the menu is pretti extens though low on the veggi option  i chose the bowti pasta with veggi  it was carrot zucchini and pepper in a light herb sauc which was bland and serv just bare warm  veri disappoint  due to the slow servic of the flirti waiter i was there far longer than an hour and got back to work late out about 15 and still hungri  dont wast your time102112

order one of my usual a larg popey for takeout  tonight pizza httpwwwyelpcombizphotos5mmfh4emxvultbnekfwqselect3sdqi6icpqrcdiktp1rf6g9kvlhcd8501lorxkjmh6g was unfortun a terribl rendit the worst ive had in recent week and the worst ive had from redendo sinc i start dine here two year ago  wow  i hadnt realiz until now after look through my review that tonight visit mark a date exact two year from the day i first ate here  i had just clock out of work and call redendo to place my order in and the timet given from order to pick up is 20 minut so i swung by a nearbi drugstor to return some unus merchandis  by the time i arriv it probabl was closer to thirti minut sinc i got off the phone  a young man id recogn as have taken down an order wrong a few week ago hand me the pizza box and state that he had made the pizza himself which struck me odd sinc i onli knew him to man the regist answer the phone or retriev ordersentre from the back  whoever hand me my pizza usual show me the finish product befor i pay for it so he open the box and i just took note of the spinach and the ricotta and said it look great and hope that his creation tast just as good as it looked

i tore into the box as soon as i arriv home and from the first bite i alreadi knew that this was a subpar product  a coupl of month ago i start to request light on the mozzarella and heavi on the ricotta but tonight i forgot to specifi this so i was delight to find that this pizza had a lot of ricotta on it  howev the mozz and the goat chees were complet absent from this product  there was howev a lot of garlic  if you look at the photo includ youll see there a lot on the pizza and on the box that have fallen off of the two slice i pop into the toaster oven and i assur you that there were plenti on those slice  it was pretti obnoxi but i persev and ate the garlic piec which were much thicker than normal  i know garlic is good for the health and im still recov from a veri recent upper respiratori infect so i decid to overlook this oversight tonight  unfortun i couldnt ignor how aw it was the next night as the pizza tast even wors veri bland so much so that i couldnt even enjoy the rest of it  it veri import to note that on both night i ate this pizza i also suffer from headach  ive never suffer headach after eat pizza from redendo befor so this was also unpleas  i wonder if the new guy ad someth to the pie  i wonder whi he even made the pie himself and not the regular cookchef  if no one was abl to creat and bake a pizza worthi of redendo reput of which ive testifi to in my review and by wordofmouth whi not just tell me on the phone  i couldv order someth els  i couldv spent 25 includ tip on other entre and not on this disastr popey interpretation

i am veri sorri not to be abl to partak in the pizza calzon and chicken fettuccin aflredo entre from here in the futur anymor sinc i now cannot trust the qualiti and present of the product serv here but i thank redendo for the great pizza mom other relat and i did have in the pastcupcak  a dessert ive never fulli understood but appreci nonetheless this perhap has someth do with the fact that i can cut a slice of cake as big as i want and still count it as just one piec with cupcak howev i find myself satisfi my stubborn sweet tooth with three or four of the tasti littl treats

aft listen to all the hype regard these particular cupcak second to the blond bombshel owner i let go of my reserv and purchas a halfdozen milehigh frost cupcak at first bite i was disappoint the frost although rather abund was superb while the cake was dri and bland each subsequ cupcak tast test yield similar result all in all the cupcak and employe are nice to look at it but fail to encourag me to come back for morewent to the claim jumper yesterday to check out their happi hour  ive dine there befor and the food is decent this review is for their happi hour onli sat down and wait about 10 minut befor we were acknowledg menus final arriv drink order are place i get a glass of wine my dine partner get a coke we wait anoth 15 minut to get our drink and we still havent order  at this point im get the hungri cranki pain and the irrit is set indrink the wine calm down

fin the waitress come back to take our order bring anoth coke and he hasnt even finish half of the first we order the shrimp taquito and crab cake after anoth gruel 15 minut our order arriv with anoth coke the taquito are a shrimp tail intact wrap in a corn chip and fri they serv the 4 with some slimi sweet sauc and a poor excus for dress up tartar sauc the crab cake not cake come out and it was pretti delici but at 1095 it better have been here the skinni on the crab cake 1295 for 2 the happi hour special take 2 dollar off ani app on the menu knock it down to 1095  what they dont tell you is they take away the other crab cake cheeki rip off

stil be hungri we order the nacho ill post a pictur later just to show how gross they were the guacamol was brown i think they ad it prior to bake the nacho which consist of chees and black bean they were so soggi i dont think they drain the bean befor pile them on also the menu boast of an array of differ salsa there were 2 jar they were both the same salsa

bil came with anoth coke  30 buck i went home and made a sandwichweve been to cjs mani time but the one reason to come here is for their motherlod chocol cake anyway we decid to come here again 

we had to wait a good 30 minut for our tabl our hostess final call our name and brought us in the middl of the dine room and just left us there becaus she forgot what tabl we stood there for a good minut wait can you say awkward final got our tabl and our server was pretti prompt in take care of us 

we didnt order ani appet caus we know the portion are huge i order the chicken fri steak like i said it was huge but the onli problem is that there wasnt enough gravi littl dri and lot of bread i wasnt too impress my wife had the fish and chip the fish was pretti good crispi and tender my son had a salad with his dinner but the salad look realli limp so overal the food was veri disappoint to top it off we were so full and unimpress that we didnt even order the motherlod chocol cake now that disappoint 

i would have to say the servic was pretti good but the food is what made our experi disappoint well have to see if we come back or notafter read a few review im begin to wonder if i even dine in the same  place as some of you

upon enter i got a strang reminisc feel that id been here beforeaaahhh yes ive got it palatt is the reincarn of the hippi commune call the brotherhood that i was born inat serious my dad deliv me in a room full of hippies

i cant believ no one has mention this kind of correlation

im realli surpris that everyon wasnt barefoot the staff scuttl around like drone i saw flower feather and grizzli beard this is definit not what i expected

you order at the counter take a number sit on chair that might fall apart at tabl older than your great grandma food is drop off that it there is no servic here you get

 if your into the whole hippi dippi artsi fartsi grandma yard sale garden type of feel then you will most like enjoy it here not to say that i didnt enjoy it  i was just pictur someth complet differ and felt mild out of place so there for i was disappoint in that aspect 

the food it was good not spectacular no ooo and aaaah over everi bite 

i got the potato mish mash scrambl egg with potato baconspinachcaramel sweet onion gouda and monterrey jack with the raisincranberri walnut toast and fresh fruit see pics
th egg were a littl wet but over all had a good flavor toast was good fruit was soggi brown appl slice not so good

mi ice tea was cinnamon appl flavori wish i would have knownnot veri good for ice tea

mi husband got the doloreswith no salsa two fri egg corn tortillasblack bean queso fresco and avocado
it was also just ok 
the egg were cook over hard  the bean were dri and the chees was in unmelt chunks
hi oj was fresh squeez and sweet that was nice too bad it was serv in a veri small child glass

ok food need to work on a better system should have waiter servic if you eat outsid most tabl are coffe tabl height so you will be hunch over other than that i guess it all about the charm

peac and lovemy friend and i finish a workout and realiz we were hungri and crave sushi  we were frantic tri to find a place to eat sushi that was open late  first of all there arent that mani great sushi place in the valley simpli becaus the fish is not fresh like ani of the coastal state  we were still on a mission

saketini was open pretti late so we made stop over here  we got a sashimi platter albacor with crab roll and a few other thing  the albacor with crab roll forgot name was veri delici  some of the sashimi peac were good but some were not as great

overal we got our fix of sushi at a veri late hour  one thing that drop the rate of the restaur is we got an automat 20 tip ad on  we were onli a parti of two  i usual leav a pretti good tip but i do not like it when a restaur mandat a tip  a tip is someth i feel is up to the custom base on his experione of our supplier insist on take us here for lunch about onc a quarter  it kinda suck  not offens but aw bore  thing on the broad menu look like they should be better than they are  blah

plus we cant booz at lunch  what ive had for booz here noth recent has not been at all noteworthi  avoid51210

came in to tri some happi hour eat fibber mage offer 50 off all app and flatbread between 4p and 7p  to begin my dine experi i found the dark in the pub to be overwhelm a word id rather use in this context is oppress but im tri to lighten up  i wouldnt have mind so much as i couldv sat closer to the door left ajar which allow light to come in but then the music blare out of the speaker overhead was just too much  to compound the situat the song select were either u2 which i like or jar irish punk rock which i dont most of which were of the latter    perhap i shouldv walk away after make these observ but ive had fm bookmark for at least six year now and i want to get it over with

aft mani inquiri about food prepar the bread use which compani  specif ingredi use etc i decid id go w the crabcak and the brais rib slider  the crabcak top w roast red pepper and garnish w wasabi and mustard mayo the latter i opt out also came w a side mix green salad and a citrus vinaigrett while this dish wasnt the bestlook of all the dish i had that afternoon dont let the pic of the bread pud fool you it was the besttast but this isnt say much  i didnt care for the watereddown flavor of the citrus vinaigrett and frank the crabcak had enough flavor so the lack of dress wasnt a big deal  i dont know if id order them again though  what was a big letdown was the brais shortrib slider dish  now these slider look fantast but the shortrib piec were so sinewi andor fatti that as much as i tri i couldnt chew through ani  i realli want to like these bec of those gorgeouslook fri onion string that sat on top of each slider  thank my server offer to swap them for someth els and it was w a littl sad that i said goodby to those onion string 

late mussel havent appeal to me so my server suggest to tri fms wasnt give me much hope   surpris these mussel tast ok and the price is right for happi hour and if i werent alreadi not disappoint in the dark of the pub the loud of the music volum and the subpar qualiti of the shortrib i may have enjoy them more  with the hope of find someth good to write about i order the bread pud  at this point i shouldv just given up

th bread pud dish which youd think look at the pic i took would tast good  was a disast  it was dark in the pub yes but the dish look like they just place slice of bread down shower them w dri cranberri and pour some white chocol sauc  someth was amiss was it even bake  how was it prepar  there wasnt enough cream sauc to cover most of the bread  i was told that the bread was inde soak in the cream and then bake but this bread pud had to be the worst ive ever tri  the pic look great but dont be fool  

the server was friend and most of the star reflect her attempt to appeas me but i didnt enjoy my experi there and would never recommend this place to anyoni live a mile from here and trust me when i say ive been here a lot it use to be our go to place for a quick dinner when we didnt want to cook it also use to be the place wed go for group get togeth in the back room the bartend and server were alway awesom and friend even rememb our name and favorit beverag the food was pretti good too 

now let jump ahead to now over the last year new manag has taken over this was an irish pub and pretti authent feel but the new owner has a famili member who play for the seahawk american footbal team so it quick becom an nfl sport bar 

happi hour use to be from 47 which is great for those who work 84 and 95 now they chang it to 36 which mean by the time we start think of go out for appet and drink everyth is full price again use to have great half price appet but you can forget that now

mi friend want a burger the other day and brought the 8year old with her was go to give the kid some of her burger but the server said it was 2 to split a meal now shes a littl girl and bare eat anyth but the server was practic scare that her manag would find out she said if her manag came out and discov it then hed charg the ladi for two meal that ridiculous

a i said we use to come here all the time but this last year the chang have been terribl i will be go elsewher in the futur8308 scandal we be live in the world of scandal can you handl this can you imagin this

al you can eat that what they said but is that what they did i give star for the miso soup and the roll it was pretti decent a wide rang of nigiri and roll that was satisfi 

but here the thing they give you one hour to eat and when they feel your eat too much well they make you wait for your next order until your time is up 

we kept ask the ladi about our order and appar i guess we were order too much and so on our last order we wait 20 minut and when she came back with it she state we cant order anymor becaus time has been up what scandal 20 minut for sushi the funni thing about it was that was our smallest order that onli had 3 order of nigiri and 2 order of roll so sadso sad

29 for 40 minutesnot an hourit a hit or miss with this place sometim you get great servic and sometim you dont everi time we walk in the hostess usual just stare the server all suck at their job im a server i know what good servic is our server was horribl she liter walk up to our tabl chew food she stop take my friend order so she can yell across the patio to some friend drive pass us oh and dont let me forget to mention that she was play with her hair brush it with her finger in front of us then serv us our food this place is a joke servic is a joke it so bad that i know if i ask to speak to a manag the manag would have probabl done noth about it howev unless i find a place with better wing i will be back but sit on the bar i alway get better servic from the bartend 

so here a note to manag retrain your server or get a new serv staffwe should have gone to le burger bistro but by the time we sat down and peek at the menu we were too tire to chang our mind  

the blue chees  mushroom burger i had was good and huge but the onion ring were kind of icki and the restaur felt like a throwback to vega in the 70sas if time had stood still  plus we show up to dinner at around 7pm and it was like eat dure the earli bird special at denni  

there are plenti of better restaur within walk distancei recommend you go elsewherso yeah the gelato is good

but 800 for a child size small ass scoop good hell to the no 

howeverth ironi here is that while all the review here read the same about ridicul exhorbit price let face it when you are out random walk around in the forum shop at caesar and spot spark shini gelato wink at youyou are not go to think to check yelp or you might but i would ventur to say most wont

so unfortun in a spur of the moment kind of purchas like this all the 1 and 2 star in the world on this place wont save a line of 20 peopl pay 800 for gelato it didnt work for meand yes there was a line

random note to those plan to check out vega rememb to check the price of someth first befor you let your visual sweet tooth steer you into a ridicul expens treat or just walk away when they say eight buck pleasthis was a tough review for me  i want to give them higher mark realli i did

i went in with low expect  ive had jewish food on the east coast ok  thing were look good right off the bat  we were seat and water and a tray of pickl appear as our tush hit the cushion  my love wife pick up a pickl crunch off a bite gave a surpris express and said not bad  ill be the jewjudg  she is jewish after all  fair enough  i thought the pickl was pretti good compar to some ive had on the east coast

that where thing start to go awri  it took between 510 minut befor anyon came over to get a drink order  we order sever item to share  my wife and i share a corn beef sandwich and fri with gravi  the kid share matzo ball soup blintz and a latka  i order coffee

th soup came first and it was veri good and authent  coffe  oh right  my water has been sit empti for a bit  the rest of the food arriv pretti quick and my coffe arriv  water  oh right

th blintz were veri good especi the chees  the corn beef was good it pass muster as authent  fri  good  brown gravi  fine but it had an odd flavor  latka  veri good  water  oh right

can i get a refil on the coffe  oh right

th price are high  the sandwich are avail whole or 12  13xx for a whole corn beef is a bit high but it is big enough to share so that a plus  one sandwich and one order of fri was enough for 2 adult   the fri were 4xx  

coffe  oh right  i dont appreci have to ask for everi refil 3 time  i would probabl write it off to just one server have an off day or someth 

in summari  good kosherstyl food a bit pricey  it will hit the spot when im crave a corn beef sandwich  the servic was spotti  so what may have been a 4 star review has been knock all the way down to 3 star  

coffenot great compar to a good deli not good when you factor in the price

it was soon after move here from los angel that i found chompi be a regular patron of west coast heavyweight such as langer and even canter i was hungri for good deli food and thrill at first  

their food is meh at best and waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpr for the qualiti  if they charg 12 the price they do current this place would be 4star but dont come up in here tri to charg langer price and serv up schlotzski qualiti 

nextwhat the matter with chompi in tempe

that alway my question and i just dont have ani answer weve eaten at this chompi three time and were alway disappoint howev weve eaten at other chompi most often the one in chandler and were stuf and happi i dont get it

w went with a group of yelper to this chompi becaus it close to gammag and we were all attend the open night product of fiddler on the roof so i suggest jewfood now be an east coast jew i have certain standard which frank arent easili met in the desert but theyr not met at this chompi at all

i phone at 300 that afternoon to give them a head up sinc we were expect twelv peopl we wound up with eight  you know how yelper are i gave them the count the time and made clear that we had a time crunch need to be out of there by 600  615 at the latest when we got there the tabl wasnt ready

w were seat fitteen minut later and i told both the host and the server that we were attend the theatr and need to eat and get go our food arriv at 545 or 550 i cant say for sure which it was had a hard time get more pickl i never got the lemon i ask for sauc had to be request repeat and the food was noth to write home to bubbeh about my extra lean corn beef was fatti and chewi and my daughter patti melt request with extra onion came with a mere four piec of onion she ask for more but they didnt arriv until she was near done eat i would have contest the extra charg for those onion but i had to get go or risk lose the opportun to park in the gammag lot from the rumbl i heard around the tabl we werent the onli disappoint diner in our party

now ive review the chompi in chandler httpwwwyelpcombizchompiesrestaurantandbakerychandl and gave it five star so the problem clear arent pervas in my opinion if wed had time we would have gone to the chompi in chandler or the one in scottsdal but the temp locat was five minut from gammag oh well ill consid this my farewel address i wont be back to the temp chompi againway overpr the pastrami sandwich was good though it had a good flavor but i cant justifi 1299 for a sandwich and a littl cup of potato salad now im not just talk about this sandwich the rest of the menu was overpr as well even the kid menu item on there were up to 8 or 9 dollars

servic was ok seem that there are better place to spend your money than here like fancier placei eat a lot of mediterranean and middl eastern food it probabl one of my favorit cuisin i had this place bookmark forev but i never get up to this area so after a hike at mt charleston it was the perfect time to stop in 

i was crave kabob and a greek salad i couldnt decid which to order salmon or filet kabob our waitress explain that i could order one of each and it would be the same price as the entre which was 1295 i went with that 

i receiv my salad first it had good flavor and all my favorit in a typic greek salad my entre come out i tast the basmati rice bland no flavor i move onto the hummus  pita the hummus was ok but my pita was basic store bought pita bread slice into triangl anoth let down so then i tri the salmon it was so dri and ined last thing the filet kabob again no flavor at all i never salt my food this need it terribl i end up use the hot sauc on the tabl to give it some flavor 

when the bill come i notic she charg me 1295 plus 695 for a side kabob this is not how she explain this to me this meal was terribl and not worth 5 let alon 20

call this place a greek restaur is like call carrabba italian food never againwhile the titl might be better suit for a manhattan chelsea night club the allur of jodi maroni is an easi one here at sky harbor  everyon hate the typic airport food option but most folk even vegan love hot dogs

but these hot dog arent even worthi of a joey chestnut or kobayashi throw down they often remind me of a layman version of a costco dog but cost near 4x as much sad to say ive eaten here more time than id like to admit but there isnt a singl dog i can recommend on the menu

i can howev digress somewhat on my experi here all of which includ slow and lackadais servic and were driven by the hope that each time would be better ive had their chicken andouill dog which was realli just an overcook hot dog serv in a semitoast bun now substitut the chicken andouill with their bratwurst polish dog louisiana boudin hot link chicken appl chicago style dog sweet italian and you have the same result

th biggest offend was their priciest option the kobe beef dog suppos made of wagyu the red meat from heaven a gift from carnivor god yet even at 9 airport price yike it still tast like  just a costco hot dog perhap a tad juicier and an interest snap to the case but noth mind blow or back break but certain wallet killing

in the end i mean jodi maroni no harm after all ive had a much more decent version of his hot dog in other citi but a littl airport kiosk in a space full of commut who are will to pay the extra buck for as bourdain would coin it meat in tube form nourish is not go to be make anyth revolutionari anytim sooni spent a lot of time think about review this place i held off for a lot of person reason 1 i use to work here but be unbiasedther are a few thing im bitter about but it main with the owner most of my friend refus to deal with trader vic becaus of me but overallif your on the strip it easi to get to but if you park in ph valetnot so bad if you park in miracl mile parkingit like a lord of the ring quest ya if you dont know your way around  you can walk in circl when you get there the hostess stand is in front and you cant tell if it a restaur when you walk in it a littl more posh than most other tvs 
app i like the coconut chicken i hate the price i like the kahlua pork slidersbut it not kahlua pork it like pork in a sweet sauc the food is not cheap believ me for the qualiti and size of portion  it suck lobster potstick yum satay is ok  i mean ive had authent  so when i tast this stuff it just ok
main cours my fave are usual the chef special they had ribey onc which was great all in fri rice was good not worth 20 buck but it not bad it hard to say i havent been there sinc februari  so i dont rememb the foodso it kinda forgetable
breakfast is good if they still serv it the waffl yum the stuf french toast is amazing
drink i develop the wasabi mari so of cours yum i also develop the coconut raspberri chocol frapp yum
mai tai is good if made right origin they use fresh lime juic  this place use lemon concentr for some reason you have to order it from scratch otherwis they use a mai tai syrup for speed most of the other drink tast the same all citrusi the bowl eh can be worth it usual they have 68 ounc of liquor in it but it better between two peopl otherwis there no point to get a buzz 
so definit one up on the view but it true  this place is bore they run out of liquor a lot it not fun like it use to be ehview one star some drink half star some staff half starthis is some of the worst chines food ive had in memori  this is like those place they use to have in the suburb in the midwest in the 80s

everi singl item was either deepfri or cover in a sauc load with extra sugar guai lo style

i got the appet sampler which was just sever version of slight differ shape bland tasteless deep fri eggrol and wontonish look thing  drip with oil

ord the salt and pepper pork chop becaus of anoth yelp review and also they list it as chef special  these turn out to be doubl bread and deep fri piec of pork with a ton of bone still on  some piec was just deep fri bone and the extra extra extra bread they coat it with is complet bland and tasteless  i think they should call it the no salt or pepper pork chop

i also order the kung pao chicken extra spici pleas  asid from a coupl of stray pepper the dish had zero heat  it was also chock full of zucchini  loooooootttt of zucchini  they shouldv call it kung pao zucchini with a coupl littl piec of dri chicken breast  and this dish was not season at all  nothin  no salt not even a littl msg

the onli dish that was passabl was the young chow fri rice  good enough not oili but onc again complet underseason  

i giveem two star becaus they seem nice and fri rice was sorta ok  im never call them againim not gonna lie im pretti horrifi by the experi i just had at aureol  ive been there for happi hour and it is fantast  two for one small plate wine and cocktail are pretti amaz  and those sirloin slider are unbeliev the two star are for thoseand the happi hour  but i have to say the dinner experi was just weird and offensive

to start i walk in and spoke to the host stand to let them know that our parti would have one more for dinner  it was then told that they did not have my reserv  that was strang id book with open tabl and had mysteri alreadi receiv the point  turn out they found my reserv and told me that my parti was alreadi seat  i guess i look at them funni and they point at the tabl  turn out i was sit with four peopl i had never seen befor  so they gave my tabl away  no big deal they werent that busi but it was weird that they argu with me that id alreadi been seat when i was stand in front of them

so they said theyd prepar anoth tabl while we wait patient in the bar  after 30 minut no one came to get us so we check in againand final got our tabl  you know it a bad sign when the first thing out of your server mouth is a giant sigh  then he said cocktail wine  no greet no smile no noth  we ask for the wine list and he stare blank at us  we repli that we had no menus but that didnt seem to matter either  so much for that wine spectat award  they have a lot of great wine but you wouldnt know it the server have no clue about them or no desir to talk about them  after be pressur into order beverag we final got menus

th menus are pretti simpl and dont go into a lot of detail  when the server came back he ask if we would like for him to talk about the menu  we said yes and he proceed to explain that they had a tast menu and an a la cart  and that was it  when we ask for suggest he mutter someth about be realli busi  then he ask where we were from in a condescend tone  ummmreal  wtf differ doe it make  youd think wed walk in with fanni pack cover in condom and sucker from a bachelorett parti  

after answer no question anoth server came by and ask if we were readi  when we ask him to talk about the menu he went into the same spiel about there be a tast menu and an a la cart  yes we can read but what about the thing on the menu  they kept ask if we were readi but wouldnt answer ani question  at that point the bread guy was look like hed be a more promis server  it was serious like pull teeth  one even made a snide remark while walk away  most place love to talk about the menu not this place

id reach a point where i realli want to walk out  im in vega for busi quit a bit more than id like and i know that almost anywher els would provid better servic  my friend ultim decid we would stay and we place our orders

long stori shorter my octopus and heart of palm salad had two sliver of heart of palm and fishi chewi octopus i actual ask my friend what was suppos to come with the octopus becaus i could not rememb and the onli other main ingredi on the plate were cherri tomato  fingerl potato  what is with this place and fingerl potato anyway  theyr in everyth but anyway  my veal loin was overcook despit my order it prepar as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm  the onli good part of the meal is that this place seem to alway send over comp desserts

i know everyon so amaz by the wine angel but i would have had a better experi watch the rock climb wall at the gym

i now hate this place  we were treat like an inconveni rather than valu guest  i miss fleur de lys i realli hope they reopen it  if they dont and you absolut must go to this place onli go for happi hour otherwis you will end up leav piss and sorri you wast your timethis place was not my bag  to say the least  when i go to vega i like to splurg and check out great restaur well i was roll with a differ crowd this time and after a few night of go big we went straight wt for our last supper

wel then again it is like right next to the mont carlo which is a crappi place to stay at anywaysi should of figur if your feel like mexican this place is just ok yes just ok their homemad taco chip are definit a winner and hard to put down salsa tasti 

i like the 2 or 3 combo option on the menu lot of item to choos from i tri the shred chicken and beef taco serv with rice and refri bean shell were homemad but a littl greasi my husband went with the shrimp enchilada 1399 noth special and expens 

the have a long list of margarita includ their kickass texass top with a shot of beer dure happi hour 3 to 630 most margarita are 599 although that may seem like a good deal dont be fool becaus the glass is fill to the brim with ice 

overal kind of pricey for a mexican restaur and not all that impress with the qualiti of the food let take it up a notch hereim not familiar with the earl of sandwich chain but the whole tudor imageri thing seem so veri 70s and yet somehow it appear less ludicr in vega where everyth has to have some theme no matter how contriv this busi sammi shop is in the middl of the hubbub of activ in the planet hollywood neverend miracl mile shop center gee mayb it would have help to have the staff dress like a cutrat masterpiec theater product of the six wive of henri viii becaus the food deserv a behead 

ok it wasnt that bad just unexcept it remind me of the equal mediocr cosi chain in new york where they serv up sandwich between flatten toast bun overd with dress i had the veggi which had feta chees lettuc a roma tomato cucumb red onion roast red pepper  mediterranean dress see my photo i just rememb that it was most wet and turn quick into a spong as i was munch it the tomato soup almost save it but it was scorch hotwhi oh whi do chain alway do that

okay so i onli order a tuna salad becaus i realli wasnt that hungri but my other gfs order sandwich and accord to them it was an overal mehh  

mehh as inyou can find a much better bang for your buck at a local sandwich shop in your neck of the wood item arent expens so i give them that they have everyth you would find hot sandwich duh wrap salad coffeetea potato chip breakfast option and even dessert  there a lot of histori behind this franchise250 year to be exact so they must be do someth right  uhhright  unfortun my experi wasnt quit entic or memorable

earl of sandwich is like subway  as in you place a sandwich shop all by it lonesom away from potenti competit and not mani food option avail and youll get hoard of peopl to come in smart earl real smart due to it vega locat ie insid planet hollywood im not surpris mani peopl line up here this is an easi grab n go mealtyp set and when in viva las vega sometim you just want a quick fix while you go around galav sin citi  

okayso on to my food

how can you mess up tuna salad right  well you sure can in this case waaaay overdress and it remind me of cafeteria food where the ladi in apron and hair net use those hand scooper to pile on a ball of coleslaw or mash potato on you cafeteria tray yai got a tuna ball insert imagin  i should have known better but i was realli crave a salad is this premad i could have sworn i saw some toss up front ohand i hate when they dress the salad for you i like it on the side i should have ask prior but everyon seem to be in a rush to order and move out the way so i grab my salad and herbal hot green tea and went on my merri way

rat scale from 15

appear ball of tuna  1  
tast mushi overdress still edibl  2
origin if cafeteria food is origin then i must be from anoth planet  1

overal score 2 star becaus i enjoy my herbal hot green tea and the salad wasnt that expens thank good 

so mayb i should have gotten a damn sandwich but i wasnt feelin it at the time and my gfs werent that impress by it either would i give this place anoth shot  if i had no other choic mayb ok yes no mayb ha im so sad earl of sandwich has definit downgrad from the glori it use to be

i came here on my last trip to vega onli to find out that earl is now onli a shadow of his former self 

let me interject with some background histori i frequent vega when i live in southern california when i say frequent i mean at least onc a month i know vega like the back of my hand i can tell you what hotel are locat where and what time each of the nightclub guestlist close i was veri familiar with earl menu drunken slur out an order for the earl cobb wrap debat over the potato salad in the fridg with my heel in hand at 4 am in the morn  that was my thing

so on my most recent trip i happili approach the cashier at earl announc that i would like to order the earl cobb wrap this was what i had been look forward to all night postclub not squeez myself into a dress not enjoy the live dj perform at a million or billion dollar club or whatev but shove earl in my face drunken after a night of danc 

then the cashier said the word that absolut broke my heart we dont have the earl cobb wrap

i stare agap at him the wrap that i had eaten loyal for 4 year straight on my everi trip was gone just like that 

i spent a while in disbelief drunken lament my sad to mrcashier befor reluct order a chines chicken wrap and make my way down the queue 

walk through the line i brighten up at the thought of at least get my potato salad i peer into the refridger and my spirit plummet onc again what was onc a generous portion of potato salad think 6 oz was now 23 oz the same appli for the yogurt parfait  it was half the size it use to be and surpris surpris the price were still the same origin prices

bi the time i get to the front cashier where custom pay i was one sad drunken ladi i shook the potato salad in mr 2nd cashier face demand whi whi did you make this smaller what happened

mr 2nd cashier respond toneless he was probabl use to these reaction corpor happened

when i receiv my wrap instead of the wheat pita bread earl wrap use to use it was some stupid flour tortilla dri and definit did not soften the loss of my belov earl cobb wrap bleh

and so i shake my fist as i angrilli write this review darn you corpor darn you how dare you take away what was onc magic about earl of sandwichthe servic here is alway pretti bad the servic is rude and inattent on a regular basi but last night take the cake 

so last night mark j and i are cruis around downttownmidtown wonder what is open and tasti at 9 pm on a saturday night we spi a sign on thai hut door  open till 10 pm score

w go in and sit down a few minut after we order drink and the waiter bring us the wrong drink btw we get news that two more of our friend will be join us a waitress approach us to take our order but we tell her it will be a few more minut becaus we are wait for two more peopl to arrive

answers

if you respond with d to all of the abov  you winthe bf notic cefior had open up in our neighborhood and we were wonder what stuff they servedfrozen yogurt  then becaus of jeff ps recent visit and the free coupon we got in the mail we decid to give it a go

th bf had warn me that it was like pinkberri which is the current rage is southern california  he said it liter tast like the kind of yogurt you buy from the store so i should be warn  it a good thing he did tell me that  i had yet to experi pinkberri myself

 had my share of frozen yogurt from place like golden spoon  to me it like ice cream that smoother  but as i said it like ice creamwhich is sweet

not in this case cefior serv up italian nonfat frozen yogurt and it a differ kind of frozen yogurt  it sour like regular yogurt and i was just not dig it  they offer four flavor when i was there  origin green tea raspberri pomegran and blackberry

they sell their yogurt by the ounc and they will weigh it out for you too  top are an addit 95 cent which seem a bit cost for me  but i guess they have to recoup their cost when their offer thing like mochi capt crunch and fruiti pebbl cereal oreo cooki and fresh fruit chunk mango strawberri raspberri etc  

you can also have your frozen yogurt on shave ice aka snow ice which is then top with fresh fruit sweet red bean or green tea yogurt  or have it blend into a smoothi for peopl on the go

i guess they are expect to do realli well they have 17 locat alreadi with two in vega alon  and by the end of 2008 they expect to have an addit 30 more store open worldwid  ambiti arent they

th girl work there are nice and will let you sampl the flavor befor you make your choic i wish the one who had help us offer a lid instead of stick a coupl of spoon in the yogurt  we still had to drive home  the bf went again last night and this time the girl work did offer him a lid

they also offer a frequent eater card  buy 9 and get your 10th one freecheck this place out due to the major of high review on yelp it was pretti warm out and we were look to cool off so we just order drink and pass on the eats

w are alway up for tri new stuff so wifey order a grape slush kinda drink and instead of go for an avocado boba smoothi one of my usual i ask for their most popular one which the girl behind the counter say is their peach perfect so i go with that wifey grape smoothi was disgust fake artifici tast and i had never had difficulti with a boba drink until now 

the peach smoothi part was okay but when it boba drink i feel i enjoy them more when i order asiantrop fruit flavorstaro avocado milk tea coconut lyche mango etc and i enjoy citrus berri and stone fruit flavorsorang strawberri blueberri peach etc more when im in the mood for jamba juic or tropic smoothi cafejust a person prefer i guess

thos boba straw are big for a reason but get those pearl up the straw was like get augustus gloop up that pipe in charli and the chocol factori they cook the pearl a tad too much and they expand a few millimet too muchmi cheek were get sore and i felt like i was go blue in the face like violet beauregard

needless to say the trash can look hungri so we fed them and we continu our search to cool offno 1 boba and ici juici still get my boba votealohastay away  that all i can realli say  my mistak was not read all the other yelp review befor tri this place otherwis i would have just said no

look can be deceiv and this place is pretti busi with larg parti take over the tabl  not onli is there a regular menu but if you look around youll see pictur with number post on the wall  good luck tri to find out what they are becaus they are list on the menu and there no price  when we ask a waitress about a particular pictur on the wall all she could realli say about it was that it was fish  uh we could tell that it was fish we want to know what kind of sauc or how it was cooked

in the begin the wait staff was on us to order but sinc we were take so long it as if we were forgotten  how could they miss us with their bright yellow menus still in front of us

aft pass on their expens pho 699 to 799 i chose the com ga hai nam hai nam style chicken with season rice for 899  initi i had seen an entré version of this dish and was go to inquir about it but sinc i want the season rice i chose to go with this option  the big f is a big fan of com bo kho beef stew with steam rice for 799 but usual see it serv with a french roll instead of rice  

as we wait for our food to arriv the wait staff at a nearbi tabl was attract my attent  although i couldnt hear what they were say their action were speak louder than their word  they were talk about clear a tabl and appar the previous diner left their bare touch strawberri shake on the tabl  im not sure what the busboy did with that shake but he sure didnt toss it into the garbag right away like he should have  what realli bother us was the plate of pho garnish that were return to the kitchen for further use  how do i know he did that  well he had a clean cart with a garbag can attach to it and he dump all the other garbag in there  but he made a point of take that plate of garnish and bring it back to the kitchen  that look suspici to me

when my plate of hainames chicken arriv it look aw  check the photo out for yourself  first off it look like leftov chicken all thrown on a plate and cover with scallion ginger and cilantro so i couldnt see the bang up chicken underneath  and there was no skin left on my chicken  part of the dish is the tasti skin and it look like they gave me the healthi version  onc i got past how littl chicken i got i notic someth els was wrong  uh where is my season rice  there a huge ball of white steam rice on my plate and the season rice is half the dish  when i ask the waiter about it he said they ran out of the season rice  when i explain that was whi i order the dish he went to the back to the kitchen  he came back reaffirm that they did inde run out of season rice and he would give me a discount on the dish  i was hungri so i ate what i had in front of me  it was far from special

th big fs beef stew was just okay and hes had a lot of the stew in other place  he was initi turn off becaus it didnt have the same color that he was use to  he point out that there was a lot of msg in it too  i also saw him pour soy sauc in it so i knew that it was not hit his tast buds

when we went up to pay i notic they didnt give me ani discount  i had to ask the waiter about it and he took 2 off the total bill  at least he did that

in the end bad food with averag servic and suspici kitchen practic  although they offer a few uniqu famili dinner option you wont see us walk through these door again ani time soon  keep on drive there are plenti of other better vietnames restaur along spring mountain

cash only

upd after post this review someon contact me say their wife work here parttim  he mention that they do not resel the smoothi but they do reus the pho condiment sinc they are a bit expens  the last i check bean sprout and lime were not expensi had go raw on my to do list for  year but never got around to it until recent 

let me start with the good the femal  work the counter was veri friend and welcom after i told her it was my first visit she suggest juic  green zing granni smith appl lemon ginger base off my bittertart palat i describ to her 

i order the green zing and the gimm the beet chees burger with a hous salad 

the juic was made rather quick  i was realli look forward to it tast like motor oil and was luke cold pretti disappoint start to my first experi but no biggi 

the beet burger came out and i realli enjoy veggi burger especi hous made  the live bread  it came on had the thick and consist of beef jerki but tast like tree bark the beet burger itself was onli slight less disgust  i  came into raw veri hungri so for me to say it was terribl is most shock to myself 

the hous salad was the best part as it was mix green kale and a flax seed oil garlic dress that was just ok and that round up a bit the salad was by far the best part of  and otherwis aw meal  i ate the entir  meal as i was hungri after eat i was liter turn off by the thought of more food even if i went  next door to get a slice of pizza 

they do not refriger or cool  or heat item to keep with the raw theme that didnt seem like a big deal to me but onli ad to the aw tast tree bark flavor meal i just ate i like the concept of raw and natur yet they put to go item in plastic bag plastic cup that are not made of corn or anyth sustain or green  they have bottl juic and vitamin in a refriger as you walk in but then everyth tast luke cold as if noth is refriger that you order

i wouldnt wish go raw on my worst enemi if anyon want a free  get juic card with a stamp on it it all your   skip it  and thank  me for save your tast bud laterive been come to this place now for a few month becaus it is open 247 and is right down the street from my hous  i also order take out at this place at least onc a week if not more and have notic some thing that have final made me choos not to come back to this place anymore

first of i would like to say that the price at this place are great veri hard to beat qualiti of the food is okay to good  some item are a great deal at a great price that is what kept me come back to this place  

now sinc ive been order take out for the past few month ive realiz that they alway mess up on someth in the order  for this whole time it been someth veri small no onion ring instead of regular fri miss bacon in a burger no guacamol etc  now this has more often then not but in my head was not such a big deal that it would chang my opinion about this place also dure my experi here ive never been charg a togo charg this past order their was a togo charg and when i ask whi that was there and that ive never been charg that befor he arrog said we alway charg togo charg bs buddi this was my first time okay that no big deal though let get on to it

just recent my girlfriend order a salad for take out  when she came back home to eat it there was just the salad no dress  this was obvious someth that need to be brought to their attent so we call them and had to drive all the way back so that they could give us salad dress  onc the second trip to this place just for one order was done we get home again and crack open the salad  onc the salad is toss with the dress we just got we realiz that the salad was iceberg lettuc when it clear say on the menu that it is a mix green salad  also it was suppos to have other item in it as well blue and red tortilla chip etc and those were not present either  they basic made it complet wrong and tri to pass it off to us this is absolut unaccept and im not will to pay for someth i dont want

w place anoth phone call to the restaur this time to talk to a manag sinc all the other employe seem to have the head up their ass and i want a resolut to fix a simpl salad that they somehow miracul ruin  the manag that answer the phone was bryan he seem nice on the phone and when explain the situat he said it was okay and to come by either tomorrow or the next day to get a refund  

upon go to montana to pick up my refund we were met by anoth manag scott this guy was not on the same page as the first manag and was actual extrem rude and complet unprofession  upon give us the refund he had the nerv to say how i do busi is to have the custom bring back the togo order to fix it which we alreadi did and he also threw in that it is the custom respons to make sure that their order is correct when they pick up their order excus me dont you manag a restaur that not how it work you dont say a custom is wrong fuck you man just get fire up think about this ass and how he is somehow a manag  oh and by the way when he came to give us the refund he threw it on the tabl and walk away  how matur as long as this guy is work there they will never have my busi again

scott if your read this get a new job this one not for you get a job where you dont have to deal with peopl becaus youv got bad attitud and shouldnt be deal with customwow be from new england area masshol  i usual am pretti lenient to place sinc we are land locked

sourdough bread to start hard exterior did not tast anyth close to fresh anyway look over the menu and was a littl shock price higher than pappadeaux n think the food qualiti better match

appet pei mussel  decent flavor  but 13 look over dehydr almost as if they were dead way befor cook time or recook or someth those we unedible

wif got the clam chowder which was actual realli good  henc 2 stars

i thought 22 buck for some scallop hmm let me tri that out huge plate came out with these littl marbl size scallop 12 of them that almost 2 dollar a piec for each lil scallop side zuchini was ok but the cole slaw definit not great some bite had that sour weird rubberband taste

waitress awesom alway smile refil our drink 

finish with a 60 bill not even close to satisfi and never go back

if you want seafood on the east valley go ahead n hit up red lobster if you want some great seafood hit up n phoenix to pappadeauxworth the drive and time will never be dissatisfied

lesson learn let say your drive down the road with an extra twenti buck you dont know what to do with

or for that matter  watch your friend eat  four of the kennedi prize petfirst and foremost andreoli is an overpr italian groceri store  as it is a groceri store visitor should not expect tabl cloth or good servic   mani of the unusu item it carri can be found for less at nearbi aj but not the broad select of chees or salumi  the homemad hot lunch can be veri good but this is not the place to bring the boss  becaus the food is homemad it vari in consist from day to day  i will say as one who live in itali for mani year the dish are inde authent and worth a tri if not worth the price  one warn dont order the pizza and expect an ordinari pizza  it a rustic pizza made with bread dough  we did not like it  andreoli himself incident can be quit grumpi to those he doe not knowtemp marketplac is desert ridg bigger huskier more intens yet slight dumber brother made by the same develop compani the layout of the place is similar but wors to dr with the district in the center and the big store surround it separ by a vast impenetr wasteland of park lot the district is an admir concept i think it like a tradit mall but at least there an attempt to move forward on it by make it outdoor that cool when it nice out but when it 139 degre out the mister are in full amazon jungl forc the biggest gripe i have about the place is the layout of the place the design is horrend 

first of all it just irrit me how the giant flashi sign face the 202 beckon unknow random passersbi to come shop there meanwhil the entir shop center fat ass is plant firm and stubborn toward temp the citi it suppos to repres the drive past temp marketplac on rio salado featur a glorious view of the back of pier one and old navi and target load dock it ugli and most import it didnt need to be design that way 

second this place is one of the least pedestrian friend strip mall in temp which is shitti becaus it also one of the newest our plan and develop should be propel forward not go backward doe the develop know anyth about the citi it in doe it repres that if your go to creat a mega structur like temp marketplac shouldnt it at least vagu repres the qualiti of it citi temp marketplac is imposs to walk around when your outsid the district if you want to for exampl walk from bevmo to pier one you must first throw yourself into a the middl of  a harrow situat there are no well design sidewalk or walkway across the meander confus road system you must just walk across the park lot between the speed frat boy in mustang and the suv drive soccer mom whove gotta get to sport chalet fast and have no time for pedestrian temp marketplac simpli doe not account for two major fact about it environ and thus it consum peopl will be walk and peopl will be ride bike and it didnt need to be design that way 

and then there big brotheresqu advertis that are go on via loud speaker all the time what up with that i love the one with the most anglo sound chick they can find harp about how great san feleep cafe is you cant even pronounc the place name right and your do an ad for it but the music is hilari sometim it sound like a gay club circa 1992 out there it like all whitney and technotron make me grin 

the good thing is that the orbit earth goe through tm the bad thing is that the light rail should have been a bit more access other than that hope temp marketplac can be an exampl of what not to do for other develop of similar place in the futurive been have a run of realli bad lunch destin in the past week 

i was crave mexican food earlier this week and a cowork had a coupon for a buy one get one free entre at qdoba now im not realli sure what an entre consist of at a place where everyth is order a la cart but figur that a burrito was as good a guess as ani so i opt for the pork

now accord to their menu this pork had been simmer in a blend of tangi tomatillo jalapeno garlic and lime juiceand their market divis deserv prop for that appet descript becaus it all a smoke and mirror act it tast like pork plain old pork veri tender pork but straight up pork all the same

add cilantro lime rice uh plain ole white rice with speck of green black bean at least they didnt tri anyth pretenti there pico de gallo some of the blandest tomato and onion to ever grace a burrito roast chile corn salsa for real now becaus i couldnt tast a hint of pobalano chile or jalapeno and salsa roja write it in spanish make it more authent duh and wrap it up in a tortilla with a diamet the width of your torso what do you get a bland 3000 calori monstros of a burrito that need to be dress up with guacamol chees and lot of salsa to make it edibl if not veri palatable

w got the food to go and the bag for our two burrito felt like the bottom was go to fall out out of curios i weigh the burrito when we got back to the lab it was over 61000 gram becaus my electron scale record the weight as err and that it max limit that over 1 pound and 543 ounc for you nonmetr folk out there or if you prefer to express it weight more figur it was the size and weight of a bunni but didnt tast near as good conejo son muy sabrosos

 also tri two taco pork and beef see abov for insight into the calib of ingredi and the three chile queso dip with chip it was to put it mild a disappoint 

but if your look for a steril fast food environ serious if chipotl is own by mcdonaldswho own this joint where you can take bland picki eater to enjoy burrito that constitut more than your entir recommend daili allow of calori in one fell swoop hit up qdoba with that info in mind you wont be disappointthe word that most apt describ the sneaker experience

eww

thi exclam should be accompani by a scrunch up nose sneer or depress sigh depend on the intonation

do the smell of open sewag waft from the bathroom entic your tastebud eww scrunchi nose

do shrivel potato skin overcook fri zucchini stick or soggi hot wing float your boat eww disdain sneer

do the fact that they constant chang their special and schedul event without notic lure you into this depress hole under fals pretens sound dandi eww depress sigh

i live danger close to this place so more often than not ill end up here when there a disput along the vein of whatta you wanna do tonight i dunno how bout you

most frequent this is the end decis on a friday night when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportun to win 20 to 30 buck if you come in first or second place but it difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it cancel everi other week without ani prior notic that kind of busi ethic doesnt instil ani loyalti in your custom base it also kind of trashi how our win credit are alway hand written in near illeg chicken scratch on a piec of regist tape onli redeem for food and onli on a day other than trivia time i get it you want to lure us back on a weekday so well spend money in the bar klassy

i wouldnt have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it the nacho are huge and cover in lot of top but it primarili cheapo nacho chees sauc or sour cream which add littl flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppi mess the wing are soggi and generic the hot isnt spici in the least mayb they were refer to the temperatur and there an absolut terribl island jerk flavor the zucchini stick are alway overcook and soggi the chees stick are hard and chewi not stringi mozzarella the potato skin look like shrivel littl potato abort adorn by three bacon bit and some nacho sauc the pizza is pretti decent and probabl your best bet i wouldnt recommend anyth els on the menu they use cheap bargain basement product and it show in the qualiti of the food

that leav the bar to make up for the abysm food too bad that pretti hit or miss with an emphasi on the miss for about a two month stretch sneaker seem to chang their daili special week by week if not day by day one day it would be two dollar ladi mix drink all day next week just 9pm to close then it would be two dollar draft all day chang to half price wing dure happi hour i dont like the bait and switch i understand that a new or struggl place need to cut cost and redefin it special but when it chang that often too quick for even the signag on the tabl or menus to keep up there a serious issu with manag that need to be address 

it seem like theyv final settl thing to 75 cent domest draft beer dure happi hour coor and bud and half price appet solid then from 9pm to close the daili drink special start good keep it simpl stupid

th servic at least tri to make up for the crappi food and ever chang drink special theyr alway more than patient when it come to explain the chang and alway apologet when they get the brunt of our disappoint when weve been victim of the ole bait and switch 

the decor look like a tacki colleg sport fan decor it with all the tabl sport differ team and mascot and paraphernalia splash all over the wall willi nilli there also a weird ident problem go on with some cheap wine print on display in the bar and a gigant statu of uncl lester from the addam famili dress in a refere suit they offer rock band but ive never seen anyon play it they offer the buzztim trivia but hard ani televis are ever tune to it there a coupl pool tabl dart a basketbal game buck hunter and a coupl other video game in the back it just seem to be have an extrem ident crisi tri to be someth differ to everyon but half ass it so no one end up satisfied

theyv taken to serv beer in plastic cup and give out paper plate for food dure happi hour which is a bit on the depress side the general vibe make it seem like it on the brink of close ani given week which is too bad becaus they easili have one of the best patio in temp 

if your go to go sit on the patio and enjoy the greeneri cool water friend duck and turtl sun themselv it will make you forget just how much of a downer it is insid the placefarmer market in phoenix are alway a let down and this one is no except  there simpli are no farmer  there are one or two peopl who buy a bit of bulk produc and resel  there are a coupl of peopl who have cut and small plant then there are the crafter  and resel who sell cute littl thing they buy and embellish or make  depend on the time of year there is a baker and there is usual a person who make oliv or pickl  i dont count the oliv guy and the hot sauc guy as farmer becaus their product are actual made in commerci kitchen and have slick packag so they can sell off their websit  nope there just isnt a farmer market in phoenix but it is a nice place to walk when the weather is good and i feel like a nice walk

for a real farmer market

ar peopl just give this place good review bc they want to pretend like theyr super cool and are total down with hole in the wall place in the hood 

bc this was serious nast we order the queso w chorizo and that was bomb ill give them that

our food came out i had one bite of my chilaquil and was like readi to spit it out the green sauc was creepi and the steak was veri off in flavor and not season at all i ask for a to go box and box up the steak to feed my dog 

mi friend order their torta she was like i cant tell if i dont like this bc it gross or bc im full i tast it and was like bc it gross she call me today to tell me she tri eat it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasti 

well be stick to the torta from gallo blanco bc even though their servic suck at least their torta is amazebal 

serious some of the grossest food ive tast the staff was friend and the place was clean and pack i just person find the food super nastiit locat insid ph right next to the park lot escal it on the corner and you might miss it if your thorough slosh 

i was plan to get manag belliger and want those yard drink from fat tuesday but see the long long long line decid to come here instead i had purchas the groupon deal for 2 yard drink earlier in the day 21 for 2 and decid that now was as good a time to get drunk aswel all the time in vegas

1 the drink were not strong it was basic drink peach slushi i know theyr probabl tri to get you to purchas an extra shot but i didnt want it

2 rude holi cow the cashier was impati and rude as all hell i dont know whi as there were no line was i disturb her chat time with her cowork i dont careeeeeeee

3 they overcharg me by almost 10 this was on top of the groupon when i point that out to her she just shrug and said they alreadi made the drink for me so what ugh fine at 32 for 2 it still cheaper than buy at full price im in vega to have a good time not to deal with some idiot who cant do math or punch in correct total on the cash register



i give you an extra star becaus the yard cup had a happi face and remind me not to throw a temper tantrumour night start out with wrong drink order a server who couldnt tell the differ between clam and mussel and er did not know the menu well at all this not onli make me sad but make me think the manag dont have a rope on their waitstaff  tell us the special are lamb and snapper  if you are interest in them let me knowotherwis i will just be recit the speech  um are you for real  i know this isnt necessarili an upscal place but that not someth you say to your tabl 

anyway i did enjoy my cabana burger with avo bacon and blue chees ask for med rareand actual cook to medium rarewhoope the chimichurri sauc was pretti wonder too 
howev my yummi food was pretti much cancel out when my dine companion seafood stew came out with two dead mussel shouldnt the kitchen be catch that when ask to get two edibl mussel the server a differ onew couldnt catch our didnt realli know what to do eventu after 5 minut a whole new dish of seafood stew came out  while everyon els at our tabl was alreadi done at this point  um okay huh noth was taken off our bill not that i necessarili thought it should have but mayb comp us a drink or not whatever

good burger shoddi servic at best huge beer menu i would stick to the bar portion of cabana room i  certain think this place would be much better if the servic was ramp up mayb we just got the dudthe onli thing i will ever rememb about this place is the ici custom servic and the inflex menu i order a bean and chees burrito sinc im a substitut kind of person and on the menu is said absolut no substitut  yike so instead of get 9 out of me they onli got 6 but let talk about this bean and chees burritoi was under the impress that a bean and chees burrito was basic  bean and chees wrap up in a warm tortilla and mayb some grade chees on top 

well this was not the case half way through my burrito i came across shred beef piec im not a vegetarian but if i was i would have had a heart attack the first thing that came to my mind was absolut no substitut  but doe that mean onli they can substitut or is the cook just go senil either way i didnt like that not one bit i didnt realli even want the bean and chees burrito i realli want the taco salad but i couldnt ask for substitut so i was forc to pick the plainest thing on the menu and they go and add stuff to it 

i did like that they left the water pitcher with us at the tablehowev the tabl they gave us was the smallest tabl in the room we bare had room for our plate and utensil letalon this big water jug i felt cramp and this was emphas by the guy sit behind me becaus when he scoot his chair back a littl bit  it near knock me face first into my plate oh and by the way larg group they absolut will not split check so this is not the best place to go dutch 

i will end on a posit note did i mention alreadi that they left water for us to refil our glass ohi did well i guess i ran out of posit  sorriwe had a late night uye with my yelpies

yelpalici dish we kept hear about is the fri chicken so of cours that was my prioriti they were do a promo special of 16 get you 10pc chicken and a 1000ccbig ass mug probabl a liter of draft beer so almost everyon grab that  

winner winner chicken dinner it was light batter crisp and came out pipe hot it wasnt veri greasi like most joint so that was definit a plus they serv the order of chicken with small banchan of sweet pick daikon radish cabbag kimche we had 4 order at our tabl of the special and onli 2 got kimche and a slaw of thin cabbag with a thousand islandesqu dress  i share one of these with my buddi nin and needless to say we gobbl it up and i know that bitch was eye the last piec hope id say i didnt want more lol  all went veri well with it but i was talk with nin and seem to agre that mayb we should have gotten a side of someth rice yeah im total filipino in this sens  or some sauc to break up the dens chicken flavor in my mouth again we gobbl so lack of sauc or anoth side didnt stop us from enjoy though it could be even better will ask for sauc and rice next time definit some of the better fri chicken offer in vega and i do love me some fri chicken 

other than the chicken there are a few rice and noodl dish and plenti of snack plate there are some odditi on the menu like snail so if you like the bizarr to be your late night eat then this place is worth explor there are more tradit item than their are friend bulgogi fri rice etc and i like that they keep it real like that 

now here like the rub

som peopl were readi to go so he brought out all the bill even though some peopl were still nosh it was take so long that peopl were wonder what the hold up in bring back all our check  later we found out card machin were downif mayb some of us were told earlier some peopl could have muster cash and gone on their way or at the veri least let peopl know what the situat to keep peopl patient also some of our late comer order food and was first sit on a separ tabl as other peopl left we move their empti plate to their origin tabl to make room for them to sit with the leftov group becaus of the empti plate on their origin tabl they didnt get food sinc they thought they alreadi got food and ate it errwel the order was put in so someth should have came out so where did their chicken go the server though was veri apologet about everyth and tri veri hard to make thing right even made some fri and tater while our compadr wait on their forgotten chicken order 

mi chicken was a 4 the servic was attent in servingcheck in and tri veri hard so even though there was some major in hous mistak that normal would be a no go i can appreci a place that tri their hardest to make it right no one is perfect and sometim there is just an off night i know they are under new manag and i am not quit sure how recent that happen so they veri well can be still smooth out the kink  i had troubl figur out what star rate to give it but after some thought i think 3 is fair it was an ok night base on what went on 

still i think this place is a interest environ pleas look at he bathroom and make sure to read the song lyric text on them hilari and veri random song choic are mesh into the art and has some adventur plate that are a must do veri soon as well as a solid bazic with their fri chicken good now if onli they had waffl i would die

 i will be back soon with the bf sinc he would like to tri the chicken but after much thoughtim go to do this cash onli and wait a while for now i think the yelper crew is chicken to tri this out again 

updat so i didnt know part of the stori of the credit card when i wrote my origin review and that alon make me bump it down anoth star to not communic with all us that the card are down and then proceed to write everyon credit card number to do it later is veri unprofession even if the intent werent shadi sorri but even though that didnt happen to my card these are all the peopl i am with now i understand whi matthew c want to burn the place i also forgot that one yelper went off with their card think it was paid for and left and later we were told he hasnt paid angela had to call him to figur out if they were pull someth sneaki on us it was veri weird that now they were abl to swipe angela card just fine to pay for joe bill when a few minut ago it wasnt work for the other yelper 

whatev was go on it wasnt handledcommun well and that the bottom linelet me prefac this by say i have been in the servic industri for the better part of 20 year i understand how restaur work as far as servic reserv repeat custom etc i was so extrem disappoint in this place here my stori 

while look for a centrallyloc place for the fam to dine we came across this pizza parlor and rememb see it on tv on their websit it state they take reserv for parti of 6 or more so i call to make a reserv the gentleman that answer the phone took our name and phone number and then proceed to let us know the rule 1 they wont seat you until your entir parti is there not realli understand sinc they push tabl togeth and could have easili separ them should our parti not all show up 2 they onli hold the tabl for 10 minut kind of understand sinc so mani peopl flake out on reserv but 10 min is a littl short especi if there traffic and 3 we had 15 hour to eat becaus anoth parti was come in he ask if 3 was an ok timefram i said it was up to his kitchen and how fast they can pump out the food  they did good  he said there was onli one tabl in the restaur that could sit 6 or more  howev when we arriv they were push tabl togeth on the patio to accommod a parti of 6 and they had anoth larg parti just in side the patio and we sat in a differ locat so not sure how he thought there was onli 1 tabl for larg parti  plus each tabl is a 2top and can be combin with x number of other tabl to accommod  there was plenti of room insid the restaurant

so after hang up i alreadi felt like they didnt realli want us there four of the six of us arriv a slight bit earli  we introduc ourselv as the reserv and they prompt correct us by say they dont make reserv they just hold the tabl and our tabl would be given away at 610 if the entir parti was not here right at 6pm we call the other two who inform us they were 36 mile away accord to their gps but they still wouldnt seat us we explain they were onli 7 min away but they said it didnt matter and ask us to wait outsid in 100 degre weather sweat our ae off they never offer water or anyth to drink just liter shuffl us out the door and proceed to ignor us for the next 7 minut sign 2 they didnt realli want us there 

sinc we were in 3 car and not familiar with downtown glendal we decid to stick it out the other two arriv and we were seat back by the bathroom sign 3 they didnt realli want us there 

the restaur was not pack nor did it get pack while we were there so im not sure whi they couldnt seat us or even let us wait insid in the air condit the onli reason this place recd 2 star rather than the 14 i would have prefer to give it is becaus of our server sandi she was amaz we want wine so she made some suggest for both red and white the tabl took her up on all that she suggest she was polit time funni profession she just rock she save the dinner for all of us thank you sandi 

the food was fair good we order the fri ravioli realli good and bruschetta as app the salad came next ok to split with someon  they are fair good size definit ask for the dress on the side we couldnt eat half of our becaus it was absolut drown in dress the pizza was pretti good be care of the pie that have garlic on them  they are larg piec of garlic so you definit want to make sure your date like garlic too  

we wont be back nor would we recommend this place to friend we will tell them our stori and let them make up their own mind and we will definit have them call ahead to see if sandi is work becaus she realli did save the nighti guess i had more expect of this place from see it on food network the food was good but the servic decor and music was not good i onli gave 2 star sinc i enjoy my meal my daughter had the pizza and i had the chees ravioli 
if you want a smile from the wait staffgood luck one was more interest in her phone and the guy was lack all express thank our waitress i think her name was patti was decent
th decor is outdat and could use some colorit veri drab and dark in here 
the music is rapthi is an italian place and the music took away from the experi i dont think i will be back againoh man i had such high hope for this place well let just get into it when wegot there we wait about 2 minut befor be acknowledg then after final be greet we were shown to a tabl that was 2 seat and veri close to anoth tabl with peopl so i ask if there was anyway to move us to anoth tabl in which i point too onli to be told oh umm if i sit you over there and a parti of 3 or 4 come we will have to move you be so perplex by this answer my wife and i sat and stare at each other for a moment  

then still want to give the restaur a chanc we order we got stuf shrimp and a bianca pizza well the stuf shrimp was fine i wouldnt order it twice the pizza was also veri bland and just not what we expect feel a littl dissatisfi with the whole experi we just left after thatmindboggl rhetor question of the day who on earth choos to have their bachlorett parti dinner at lucill 

mi down home girli girl who bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palat absolut ador this joint 

to start the servic was absolut atroci parti of eight on a friday night annoy i can see how it could be more annoy lose the reserv and shove us into a corner design to seat five mayb six max a bunch of elbow bump scantili clad chick all doll sip fruiti ass hurrican and the like probabl pretti humor to observ not so humor to navigate

put on your woogirl face though becaus this is a partay woo

br out the mild scandal goodi bag fill with peni lollipop dirti fortun cooki and flavor lube ie the tame stuff just scandal enough send your great aunt esther into a connipt fit serious if this was the genuin highlight of this meal it realli doe not speak high of the hot garbag be slop on a plate at lucill woo

and we wait and wait and wait 

bread final woo

wait are you sure you didnt confus biscuit with hard tack becaus not even the scrumptious honey butter youv got is worth the dental bill incur from teeth this rock 

again we wait and wait and wait 

pull pork woo

hold up how doe a pull pork sandwich manag to be incred greasi and dri as a bone at the same time have i slip into some altern dimens is it opposit day becaus if so this shit is fingerlickin good you best slop on that bbq sauc to add some semblanc of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesnt soak through the bun in 25 second flat worst pull pork sandwich i have ever eaten hand down the garlicki mash potato as a side were the onli save grace of the meal

i serious have no idea how this place stay in busi if it were not for the over abund of low swingin crotch fruit i brought to the parti dinner here would have tank hard and fast it was awkward drawn out 3 hour and ridicul expens the best part about the experi was walk out the door woothird time is a charmon bad review and one good review with a friend in town we decid to go for bbq i have been to lucill a coupl of time the last time was descent so it seem like a good option tiebreak indic the first review negat may be the more accur again the food was good but my friend wasnt happi with the gravi slather all over the chicken the issu with slow and incorrect servic remain  it took a while to get drink refil were slow and incorrect sever peopl came in after us and left befor us dessert was so slow we had to cancel it they must make each cobbler from scratch as order becaus 15 minut later we still had no pie an addit displeasur is the restaur is veri loud  especi on the patio it is hard to hear other at the same tabl due to the nois two hour for a friday lunch for three is a bit ridiculso disappointed

mi husband and i went last night with our infant daughter asleep in her carrier and here is a rundown of how it went

w were prompt greet and ask by the hostess if we need a carrier sling  i declin and said id just tuck her carrier under the tabl by my leg  the hostess then had a subhostess  come over and take us to our tabl  she also ask if we need a sling  again i declin  minor annoy  

what wasnt minor what that she took us over and seat us with 80 of the other patron in the most empti place  we were almost all group into the same corner of the restaur  nobodi want to go out to dinner and listen to all the convers of everyon around them when there is room all over the restaur  spread out your diner give peopl some elbow room and privacy

so then our waitress come up and take our drink order and that when i saw that they are ask almost 5 for a mason jar full of strawberri lemonad  i almost laugh out loud  serious who the hell think that 5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberri lemonad 

rais eyebrow  uh huh that what i thought too  absurd

so i order the bargain 4 plain old lemonad  im definit not a cheap ass but im also not an idiot

th lemonad price actual made me think of the 5 milkshak scene from pulp fiction  and if you dont know what the hell im talk about then stop read this review right now and go rent get pulp fiction on stream netflix    

ill wait for you to come back

drum fingers

okay done watch the movi  that scene was good right  okay back to the review

anyway the drink were prompt and ill just say it that a pretti fuck good lemonad i dont know if it worth five dollar but it pretti fuck good

so the waitress then ask if if wed like an appet so we order a 4 half order the full order was 7 of fri green tomato which by the way is also an outstand movi   what  youv never seen that either  gasp


go on ill wait  again

tap foot

back  outstand film  amiright

back to the review  again  

the half order of fri green tomato was a complet fuck joke  there were two yes i said 2 fri green tomato  not onli was i flabbergast at the utter lack of valu for the 4 i just paid for that tini plate with 2 piti tomato slice but they were imposs hot mushi and utter tasteless  even the shitti red pepper sauc they were swim in was complet bland  unbeliev  should i even bother ad that it was deliv to our tabl by a differ server who walk by us with two plate look confus turn around mutter someth under her breath that sound like they order the wrong tomato put it down and walk away with the other plate still look utter lost

so when we order the world biggest rip off of for an appet we also place or dinner order  i ask for the bbq shrimp dinner 20 and i substitut mash potato for the cheesi grit sound yuck and i decid to stick with the green that it come with origin  my husband order the beef rib and corn on the cob i have no idea what that cost but our final bill was almost 60 you sort that shit out becaus i cant math veri good

our food came right away which was good  what was veri bad was that my plate was utter cover in some parsley and dri rub garnish that had been liber sprinkl around and over the whole plate by someon im assum mustv had a grand mal seizur right as they were hold a hand of this stuff  my food and plate was cover in this crap  i scrape it off as best i could and easili came up with 14 of a cup of this sprinkl garbag all over everyth  it was awful

ad to that the green were horrend  bitter cold and tasteless 
the shrimp were drown in this ghast bbq sauc that was an unappet blend of too spici and not quit bbqi sauc  i cant put my finger on it but i didnt care for it one bit  so i sat there and choke down my 20 worth of shrimp and pick at my mash red potato which were the onli thing decent on my plate  i even complain to my waitress that my plate was cover in this nasti crap and had ruin my food all she could do was look at me and say oh im sorry

r that it  no offer to get the manag or replac my food anything

worthless

in comparison the husband food look pretti good as i look on mourn at his plate and look back in disgust at mine

i want to like this place i realli realli did  the decor is fabul and the place is uber cute but the bizarr seat pattern the ridicul price for thing like lemonad and 2 ined fuck tomato and the overzeal garnish of ined chop parsley and dri rub were too just muchwhen i first start use bb i was a huge fan we got a ton of stuff and it was great but what i notic as week went on the excit dull  we end up toss a lot becaus it was almost bad when we receiv it  

as a famili of 4 it was disapoint to get 8 thing of one item and then 1 of someth els  it alway an unknown or odd assort becaus it pass out among the basket  the best part was be push to cook new thing cook veggi id never use befor  person id rather pick up from a farmer market there are sever great one around i still push myself to tri new veggi but now we choos them and how much of themafter a year of basket i have  to downgrad bounti basket the qualiti was never except but nonetheless im see the qualiti continu to declin too much produc that is spoil within a day or two im realli get tire of certain stapl they throw in everi week lousi appl romain lettuc i bought a case of honeycrisp appl when they were in on special  extrem disappoint they were tini and start to spoil after just a few day that may have been my fault for not take them out of the case immedi and check for bad appl 

bounti basket is more concern with quantiti over qualiti which is fine becaus that their whole mo im just tire of it and will have to look into a csatook mom and myself to have dinner here after work on sunday 412  nice space  we were given aboveaverag servic when we were seat at the robata counter  actual it the level of servic i expect given the atmospher of the restaur  anyth less would have been suspect  when we had to move to the bar in order to take advantag of revers happi hour the servic level drop consider more on that later

sinc we had arriv around 830p we studi the menus to see what we could tri off of the regular sushi option for dinner the softshel crab and happili found out that roka akor recent start offer on a smaller scale a few robata app onli to be serv on sunday  i thought what a nice way to be introduc to the robata menu  i ask the usual question regard allergi concern and ask how certain item were prepar  i even hand the bartend  colin a list of allergen to hand to the chef  evid this list was onli go to be look at onc sinc mani of our dish had to be correct after delivery

off of the robata app menu i order the shrimp 5 for mom and the zucchini 150 and the black cod 5 for us to share  off of the regular sushi menu i order the softshel crab roll 9 for 5 pcs for mom  the time of deliveri of these item was haphazard  it took at least 10 minut befor the plate contain two mediums shrimp to arriv  to charg 6 for two grill shrimp is just ridicul  it did smell wonder and look appet but mom wasnt wow by them certain not at 3 per shrimp  the softshel crab arriv about 5 minut after the shrimp did and look great  mom found the rice good enough but she still wasnt feel ani love  the plate of zucchini arriv rough about 5 minut after the crab roll that 20 minut after i order and held 5 pcs of season zucchini salt pepper and soy and a dollop of mustard sauc at one corner of the plate  mom like the one piec she tri but as much as i tri to get her to tri the mustard she didnt so i cant report on that aspect  so here we were 5 minut befor happi hour was to commenc and all i had to nibbl on were the zucchini piec black cod was nowher to be found  correct colin the bartend said he spi it at the robata counter but did not make a move to retriev it  i ask colin if i could give him my happi hour menu select all cost 5 each so that he may have them readi for entri at 9p  he took my order of crispi squid and a salmon roll  i also order two roka akor burger one without the housemad bun and instead ask for an extra slice of heirloom tomato as a sub  would you believ that the crispi squid again onli for mom to enjoy bec the batter contain  and the salmon roll which arriv with  which i wrote down on the list as two of my allergen appar the chef did not rememb nor did colin recal to alert the chef arriv befor the black cod app  anyway the salmon roll was left for my mom to enjoy while the chef prepar anoth allergenfre for me  befor i go on let me say that mom love the calamari  this was the first dish that wow her and she exclaim that this version of calamari is the best shes ever tast and even beg for me to forget about my allergi and tri them they were that good  but i stood my ground  i found the salmon to be veri freshtast and mildflavor  the peasiz misomayo garnish that sat atop each piec was so mild the roll could have been serv without these embellish and no one would know the differ  id say that the black cod 3 pcs arriv at least 45 minut sinc the time of order  at least  arent robata item esp seafood suppos to be quick to cook  i will say that the cod tast superb and id order them again  well mayb  5 for three small piec is too much i think

last but not least to arriv were the beef burger oneatatim  funni the first burger which arriv without avocado but with a bun so that was quick return  my mom burger came with everyth on it but she didnt tri her until mine arriv she was still work on the calamari and the salmon roll  i like the beef patti cook perfect to medium rare although i wish there was more flavor  mom burger look amaz  too bad the light at the bar was veri minim one oil lamp for the both of us until colin saw me take photo and lit up anoth and place it in front of me but the fire die down soon after

i hope to return again to see if the servic improv better memori recal and time of deliveri  i found the ambival show by colin of the greater than 30 tip id given him offput  factor in the price of the comp salmon roll plus tip base on the burger origin price of 4 each too  hmm mayb not too soon a returncan somebodi pleas give me a tongu scraper quick the tast or lack thereof of the crappi 9 bloodi mari is pierc my tongu one of the thing that irk me the most is when you go to a restaur spend ten dollar on a signatur cocktail and it tast like garbag 

in this case it tast like water tomato juic with a sprinkl of pepper and a massiv celeri stick that engulf the glass 

so you say you should drink beer when you go to these place your right but then dont put crappi drink on the menu just to fill up space 

all in all we are in scottsdal after allther are a million place to go that have more to offer 


i left after the drink you got me at hello no not so muchbúzio has been on my to tri list for quit some time  when i saw a groupon for it i bought one and plan to have dinner here on the night i was go to see penn  teller at the rio

i had a reserv for 630 and i was prompt seat in an almost empti restaur  there was one tabl occupi and one person eat at the seafood bar  i had look at the menu onlin but i took some time look there chang my mind and then order  i was brought a bread basket serv water and brought an ice tea quickly

i order a jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail the miso chilean sea bass and the 7 layer chocol cake for dessert  the lump crabmeat was the best part of the meal  the crab was tasti and the cocktail sauc they brought had extra horseradish to mix in  i realli enjoy this appetizer

th sea bass was disappoint  it was on the menu under their hous signatur section of the menu  it describ as sea bass with a hous made miso glaze  what i got was more of a miso gravi than glaze and it wasnt appeal  when i tast it i wish i had order the plain sea bass  the sea bass was moist and veri hot temperatur  the entré come with two side and i chose cole slaw and garlic fri  the fire were good but they had absolut no tast of garlic  the cole slaw was ok

when it came to dessert i had ask my server if the cobbler was warm  he said yes  i ask him if it was alreadi warm and he said no  i order the cobbler and ask that it not be warm  about 3 minut later he came back and said they ran out of cobbler  i opt for the 7 layer chocol cake  i wonder if they realli were out or if the cobbler was inde kept warm and he didnt want to tell me that

servic was spotti dure the night  empti sweet n low packet were not remov from the tabl until i put them in the empti crab cocktail glass  ice tea wasnt refil as quick as mani restaur of lesser cost and the tabl was not proper buss  the waiter didnt remov the bread basket and bread plate befor he brought the dessert  after i had taken a few bite of the cake a bus person came by and remov those items

and then there the groupon  the fine print say not valid with ani other includ total reward  that mean they dont give you the tr price  it not that much of a loss to the custom and it shouldnt be that big of a deal for búzio either  1 more for the appet 3 more for the sea bass and 1 more for dessert  you got 5 more out of me for use a groupon  was it worth it to you  also the groupon state that an 18 servic fee note they cant say gratuiti anymor becaus of ir rule will be appli to the bill prior to discount  i somewhat understand this but my server got cheat a bit becaus i normal do 20  not that much differ but hey im get back part of the tr price i couldnt have  

final reserv were made through open tabl  at ani other restaur as soon as i check in open tabl say i have 100 point  as of this afternoon my open tabl point are pending

thi appar is the way búzio oper  dont be busi friend with the custom  instead challeng them and nickel and dime them everi step of the way  groupon normal are sold by new compani to drive traffic and make a name  the other reason is to help fail place  sinc the búzio groupon is an ongo seller i can onli imagin that theyr struggl to stay alive

what a mistak it was to come herei am truli disappoint in this experi i have heard so mani amaz thing about mastro and how their steak so amaz and perfect  i was surpris that my experi was a complet opposit of the thing i heard  it veri nice when you walk in and the hostess are veri nice  we made a reserv in the loung not know how loud it would be  squeez into a tini booth in the corner we sat down and realiz how far we were when face eachoth but odd enough how close we were to the next tabl  5 min pass no server no one to ask us if we want water 10 min final someon come with no introduct just stick the menu in our face like here order  so at this point i felt uncomfor go to a place for my boyfriend birthday that didnt realli seem to want us here  we look over the menu everyth of cours al la cart i was warn of the price alreadi  we order a bone in rib eye bone in filet and lobster mash potato  food took a long time to arrive

bon in rib eye  right when my steak came i could tell it was overcook becaus medium rare is not hard to touch  i was reluct to send it back becaus i was so hungri and i didnt want to be a bother but my boyfriend assur me that if were go to pay over 50 for a steak it should be perfect my steak had becom well done after we were abl to flag a waiter down  brought me a new one and right away it was well done again also the waitress shine a brightlight at me and told me pleas cut down the middl so we can see  at this point i felt so awkward i didnt ask to chang the steak becaus i dont want to be so difficult twice  overal the flavor was realli good but overcook 

bone in filet  my boyfriend order a medium rare as well and it was also overcook but onli to medium  becaus a filet is such a good cut of meat he didnt exchang it caus it was still enjoy  i have got to say this was the best piec of filet i have everi eaten  

lobster mash potato this was pack with flavor and chunk and chunk of lobster realli amaz  no wonder it more than 30 buck  

we order coffe so we wouldnt be coma induc from all our food realli realli good coffe  sinc it was my boyfriend birthday they brought out a cake which was veri nice  

so from feel bad about send my steak back my boyfriend and i both told our waitress thank you for send it back we realli appreci it not onli did she not acknowledg us she roll her eye  like wow im sorri i want some qualiti for the 200 buck i spent  i realli never had such bad servic at a high end resturant

honest im not sure how i feel about this place yet the filet was realli good but the servic threw off the experi  and if this is a steak hous they should realli perfect medium rarewhat exact is go on here

th boyfriend some friend and i went here on a friday night 

we wait about 20 minut to get a pager and wait anoth 30 minut until the pager went off and were seat  under that impress we thought this place would be good

w order mild bbq and 911 wings

first the mild
thes are fri greasi chalki tast bread wing smother in butter no salt no tast disgusting

second the bbq
these were the same chalki flouri wing bare touch with bbq sauc it doesnt take a magician to toss a pan of fri wing in sauc yknow they couldv spent the extra 5 second toss some more sauc so the wing were actual cover in it fail

911
thes brought tear to my friend eye the boyfriend who can normal stomach anyth hot onli ate 1 our friend ate 3 they paid for it later in the bathroom lol

th onli thing about this place that was posit was our waitress she was so attent and friend she was right there when our sodaswat got low and didnt take long at all when we ask for the bill she was veri awesom and receiv a veri nice tip from us

thi place is just gross gross gross gross stay awayi decid to take the owner up on her offer of a dozen free cupcak which she offer after read my origin review to tri to entic us to give her busi anoth chanc i call ahead of time to let them know the situat and that i would be stop by the ladi on the phone said that i could pick the order up at anytim befor the close of busi 

upon arriv i was immedi greet by a staff member i then inform them that i was there to pick up the aforement cupcak rough a minut later i was greet by the owner and prompt question as to whyyyy i had post a negat review on yelp she then ask whi i had not call them person to express my concern about the cake tast i explain to her that yelp is an open site and consum are free to share their reviewsexperi whether they be good or bad at which point she agre but still seem displeas 

she mention that the bakeri never charg for tast they mere requir a deposit of 20 via a credit card if a custom fail to show for their cake tast appoint the credit card is charg i state that it appear to be a miscommun by her staff as i was led to believ that i was be charg for the tast on this point i was incorrect in my origin review 

she gave me the cupcak they were were cold which i found strang and said i hope you post a better review this time to which i state well i hope we like the cupcak i prompt thank her and took the cupcak a random assort chosen by the staff befor my arriv and left to go home and call my fianc to vent 

mi fianc and i will most like will not be eat all of them but for the one we do tast our opinion are as follow  

better than sex cake  the fudg was tasti a littl thick but some peopl like it that way the cake itself was soggi and the flavor was somewhat flat the caramel was a plus but could bare be tast i believ the caramel is the reason whi the cake was soggi the whip cream fill and toffe piec were a delici accent veri messi 

littl deb  the fudg frost was good but again too thick the whip cream fill again was delici the cake was dri and again somewhat flat 

plain jane  the cake was dri howev the cream fill was delici 

plain jack  the cake was moist and the fill was tasti out of all of them i think we like this the best 

oreo  the cake was pretti moist the whip cream fill was again a hit the more you eat the frost the more the oreo flavor come through 

cosmo  the cake was dri raspberri fill was decent veri tart the coconut was a nice touch the frost was over sweet 

boston cream  pretti good and im not a big fan of cream style pie the cake was veri moist 

spumoni  the pistachio bavarian cream fill was more like a pud the green color threw me at first but i overcam my fear of snot color food and sampl some the cake was moist 

cake of the month  pbj the peanut butter frost terribl the cake was moist and there was actual grape jelli insid that flavor combo was not bad if they could have actual use peanut butter instead of the peanut butter frost it would have probabl been better togeth 

now that weve odd on sugar we can safe say that the cake was overal dri the frost were neither a hit nor a miss the whip fill was the star of the cupcak it safe to say that if were in the mood for cupcak ill save myself the money and make them myself at home 

4 star for the cupcak be free 
2 star for the cupcak be overal noth to write home about 
go with 2 star if i could give a 12 a star here i would rate it 25so i have been lure back sever times

it such a scam they suck you in with the fanci menu and these fab chip and salsa trust me after eat those youd expect to the food to be pretti damn good but no to quot jenn h  it is  blech die

if and when i come back ill stick to the chip and salsa i also would usual order the tabl side gauc  but have found that they put such larg chunk of onion and jalapeno it realli take away from ittak your time chef and fine chop that shit

il give 5 star for the chip and salsa
and 15 for the food but you cant have bothummm  i  dont  get  it  
 
can someon pleas explain to me how this place is ani differ from tcbi from the earli 90s  besid the ridicul tryingtobetrendybutjustlookingcheap decor  i went in saturday afternoon and it was pack  i got sampl of their flavor which are pretti limit to start with  the custard were good  the yogurt were ok  i dont get the hype over the twangi tart it tast like plain yogurt to me which in and of itself tast like spoil milk  no thank  i wound up get a pinalada smoothi and quit frank i make way better smoothi in my blender at home  the pineappl tast can and there was hard coconut or mango in it at all as list on the menu
 
admit i didnt have a crepe which i am a sucker for especi with nutella so i might be back in here for one
 
so  what is it that set this place apart  they offer a few flavor of frozen yogurt  and  top  and    is it just that im spoil by all the incred local ice cream parlor in boston like jp lick and emack and bolio to even care about this place  i just dont understand the draw whi anyon would drive so far for frozen yogurt  are there realli no other option out here  sadi wont write too much about this buffet it got the job done as far as fill our tummi but it was noth amaz the onli thing it had go for it was the mimosa and even those were mehok just expect your run of the mill cafeteria offer and you wont be too disappointone word expens 

i was with a friend of mine who had gotten engag recent and we were check out the bridal store next door we decid to get a bite to eat and there was a big banner advertis that they won some sort of best new restaur award so we decid to give it a tri 

i am not a regular tea drinker but sinc it was their special i gave it a whirl it was okay just tast like tea but it was 350 the menu was the same way i think all the sandwich were about 12who do they think they are to top it off the food took forev were were there at about 230 and there was onli 1 other tabl but the food took over 20 minut 

the food was decent flavor wise but we realli felt like it was overpr next time i want some ice tea i will just stick to starbuckcame to this hot mess last weekend and was not impress  wait way too long befor we receiv ani servic drink took forev order a mai tai and receiv a glass full of sweet  sour not a great crowd and veri rude disrespect bouncer luckili there is a saddl ranch right across the way that end up save the nighti was told by a close famili friend that i need to give this place a tri he told me that they do teppanyaki style cook and one of the thing that he kept rave to me about were the sauc which they make in front of you that went realli well with the differ dish  he was rave about the food qualiti the fresh of the ingredi and how it was a whole calib abov other teppanyaki chain  walk in we saw the swanki and posh interior and i felt we could look forward to an awesom meal  unfortun me and my gf this was as good as it was go to get and left here veri disappoint which was unfortun consid my famili friend realli hype us up and consid we saw all the posit yelp review  i will say we did go do go dure lunch and mayb as a result you dont get the full experi that the dinner crowd get but i with all honesti i am base most rate on the qualiti of the food we received

w walk in and got seat fair quick as there was a group of other walkin sit and wait  i talk to the other sit there and found out one coupl was sit there for about 10 minut and the other group of three peopl had been there for almost 30 minut and still hadnt taken their order  so needless to say the other group seem slight irrit becaus of the wait but i guess i can see how it isnt exact cost effect to do teppanyaki cook for just two or three peopl  but still sit that long can be a littl irritating

th soup was a littl on the salti side for my tast the soy sauc kinda cover up the overal flavor of the dish  the lunch combin also came with some fri rice which was hot and did have some crispi rice piec which was a nice thing but i felt that the flavor was a bit on the bland side  the sauc that my friend told us about werent be made in front of us they were come out of a squeez bottl one be miso base and the other tast a littl soycitrus base both were good but didnt find it much differ from the same sauc you get at benihana  the chef we got that day didnt seem that into it he was there and cook it but didnt say veri much or do much interact with the guest at the tabl  the onli reason i bring this up is that teppanyaki is suppos to be a show part of the reason you usual pay for this is to be entertain while you eat

th chef continu on and start to make or meal i had tri some of the veget stir fri that my gf order probabl the best thing i had dure this meal the veggi were well cook not over done and rubberi nice light char on it and pretti well season  if i knew what was to follow i would have stop eat here  next came the steak and prawn  while i went and ask for medium rare he serv it well down the steak was a brick and the prawn were overcook and rubberi  my gf and i share a side a scallop which were onc again over cook  no moistur left in the disk shape brick we were given it was ined we didnt bother finish the dish

i was realli disappoint in the meal i realli had high expect for place base on the review and recommend that i got  i realli want to like this place becaus i want to come back and do a late night food run and tri their okonomiyaki  but after have such a bad lunch experi i dont think ani amount of booz and drunk munchi could get me to come back on this trip  ill give them a tri down the road for dinner mayb it will be better experi  but in the mean time i gotta go call my friend and give him a hard time about that recommendwhat qualifi them to call themselv nativ new yorker

what doe peddl cheap batch of tasteimpair wing crunchi pizza and nacho platter have to do with new york

or even new yorker where the man in the fanci hat that serv me my wing what you dont have one then again i ask what new york about you

and not to be picki here but usual your suppos to wait for the chees to melt befor you serv the smother fri is that whi im pay the 50 per ranch is your shred chees heat machin broken 

doe new york know your up to thismy yelp review for the miss dozen wing got the manag attent back in decemb 20 2012 so i thought i would write an updat  messag from the manager

i have put you in my manag log for a dozen wing on us  pleas let us know immedi if there is ever a problem and we will happili correct it if you wouldnt mind updat your yelp review state that this has been resolv we would great appreci it

that is nice that they realli read the review  i just have not had time to go back sinc decemb  thank for reach out to your customas far as locat and overal vibe of zteja goe it a hit it seem to serv alot of young attract peopl the outdoor eat and bar is fun and the big screen tvs are a cool but the food and servic was just a total miss for me 

unfortun the food just didnt have much go on first the cornbread is a fun idea and is a nice chang to free appet but it was super thick and lack ani real cornbread flavor or consist the catfish taco were a whole lot of cabbag and not much els i liter could not tast the meat flavor hidden under the amount of cabbag stuf in and sad the bake seafood enchilada were anoth miss it appear to be two tortilla cover in sauc and rice with two shrimp insid i couldnt tast much els and felt i could have taken a better stab at make this meal at home myself  see my pictur to get a better idea

on top of this the servic was a bit lacklust there seem to be a waiter and waitress simultan serv us one take the order one get our drink the other bring out our food the other with our check  as confus as this was it was difficult for me to get my water refil and had to flag down the waiter 23 time to get their attention

id like to add that dure my stay in phoenix i saw the hottest girl of my entir vacat at ztejaswhich was a plus lol but serious if your cruis the mall and look for a quick bite to eat it wouldnt be a bad idea to check out zteja just dont expect to much im sure this place doe it drink much better we dont have a tgi friday in my hometown so my boyfriend and i specif plan to visit this locat on our recent trip to vegas

w were seat right away which is alway nice  we then wait at our tabl for 1015min for anyon to even greet us or smile our direct  when our server final arriv the first word out of her mouth were im exhaust  she then proceed to complain to us about her last tabl as an excus as to whi we had to wait so long just to get waters

w had enough time to decid what to order as we wait so long  i decid to tri the special the hostess told me about steak and lobster for 1399  what i didnt know is that it was on a time limit  the server had the nerv to look at her watch after make us wait 15 minut and tell me i bare made it in time to order that  i also order a cocktail at this time

th cf steak was  not bad but the gravi was less than averag clumpi and bland therefor lessen the overal tast 

the pancak tast as if were made from a generic box mix with some extra ingredi chocol chip ad  noth specialanyon can make the same at home

th bg well the biscuit were hard and oili  the gravi again bland and clumpy

mistak 1  not a big crowd on a friday night grant we did arriv a littl later than the normal dinner crowd 8ish but there were veri few peopl eat here which was a littl disconcerting

mistak 2  had to wait over half an hour just to order even though the place was empti  our waiter appar decid to go on a smoke break and were not talk cigarett here peopl right when we sat down  this left me no option but to go to the front and ask the girl whi we werent be serv  they apolog profus and got our waiter out to our tabl in a few minut 

mistak 3  the food was not that great  we order two small pizza two appet babi back rib and stuf bell pepper and pork tenderloin cook to medium  the pizza both were cold and tast like cardboard and the pork tenderloin was a littl on the tough side definit not cook medium  the appet were okay but for all the food that we got we both left readi to snack when we got home sinc we didnt finish our less than spectacular meal

i will say that the price were reason and the atmospher was pleasant but those are about the onli redeem qualiti i can find in this restaur  we will sure not go back to javino for the simpl fact that there are an abund of restaur in scottsdal alon that offer the whole packag in the dine experi without compromis the servic or the qualiti of food  nice tri though 

255met some colleagu for drink here the other night  we were have a good time then all of a sudden at 845 pm our server come over to tell us that it was last callwhat  yep last call becaus they close at 9 pmyou gotta be kid me  what is this

servic averag  employe seem bother by my presenc  wtf 

food the cupcakeri boast nobodi make them better i beg to differ  i came by on a friday morn just 2 hour after open and they alreadi ran out of a flavor  better place would make sure to have enough product avail and make more when they run out  first sampl the julius intens orang flavor is there with good moist but there was someth not quit right about the flavor someth artifici and chemicallik that had me reach for my bottl water  second sampl southern bell a classic red velvet that again was good on moist but someth was miss in the flavor depart the tast was odd  come here if your into the gaudi of the strip and want to see it in a cupcak shop  overdon and artifici sum it upwant cupcak skip this and just go to the smiths

300 per cupcak 000 for the rude attitud on the side

i had the red velvet i wasnt impress my husband had the chocol both where dri over sweet ice and the top were realli hard
 
return factor nah i can get delish red velvet cake at smith and earn some smith pointmy son want to treat his boyfriend and me to dinner want someth near the theater we were head too and someth they havent tri  i saw humbl pie was in the area and ask if they were game and yes they were now i have heard good sold thing about humbl pie from mani friend so i was pretti excit to tri them out  

it was sunday night around 530 we walk in and where greet right away and ask how mani in the parti then the host turn his back  a server walk up and ask how mani in the parti i had to answer becaus it appear the host had better thing to do whi even ask if you didnt even care

w were seat hand menus and drink order were taken  for appet i order the toast ravioli  they were stuf with ricotta chees and serv with marinara sauc to be honest this dish lack flavor prego sauc has more flavor that the marinara sauc that came with it  12 the ravioli were toast perfect the other were just hard even though the dish look great the dish didnt wow me
 
mi son order the lasagna which was the win dish of the night everyth cook perfect  his date order the penn with vodka sauc with chicken 5 buck upcharg when it came out it look like ad the chicken to the dish was an afterthought it was just a chicken breast dice up lie on top of the pasta the sauc had great color but lack flavor 

sinc i was at humbl pie pie is what i am get right  wood oven cook pizza sound amaz  i order the bbq chicken pizza with smoke mozzarella bacon fontina green onion and bbq sauc the bbq chicken is one of my favorit type of pizza so i was pretti excit when i got my pizza it look pretti amaz but when i start to eat it i notic it was cover with greas even my crust was soak in greas i couldnt eat it all my belli was becom a greas pit it was just too much for me  


our server was never around it wasnt that busi the food was ok the place look like a lot of fun the lasagna rock but my return rate veri lowyell at me call me name beat me up just pleas pleas pleas dont make me go back to saddl ranch  ick from begin to end  

i made the mistak of bring a coupl out of town buyer here last night a monday mind you think it would be fun and kitchi  you know they could watch a coupl lush get on the bull and made fool of themselv and fall off rustic cowboy atmospher good enough for entertain out of towner anyways

oh how wrong was i  just my luck it was their 1 year anniversari parti and the place was pack  and pack with the worst kind of peopl  it look like a real world cast call had thrown up all over the bar  skanki underag girl liter fall over chair and be annoy in the way all the time  oh and im pretti sure that all the steroid ever inject in az were in that bar too  and get this they were all wear crystal on their shirtspuke

it took forev to get serv at the bar which we obvious didnt stay at long becaus my client want to get the hell out of there asap

th onli reason in get ani star at all is becaus i cannot entir turn my back on ani place that serv cotton candi  that would be the 5 year old in me  the last two time ive been to saddl ranch it been disappoint both time my group and i arriv dure dinnertim and ask to be seat insid for dinner when we arriv the entir restaur was practic empti and yet both time they told us that the wait was 45 min an hour due to reserv parti yet like i said nobodi was there and in the time we were there i never saw one reserv parti arriv while the wait to sit insid was 45 min  an hour coincident enough they alway have seat avail on the patio which is where they seat everyon who were walkin sinc we were hungri we end up sit out on the patio and the seat insid remain empti for the major of the time we were there do they want peopl to sit on the patio to make it seem like more peopl are at saddl ranch then realli are who know but when it that hot it too to eat outsid i understand that restaur get crowd but weve now come to saddl two time and have been told it too full to be seat insid both time and we could either wait an hour leav or sit on the patio in 115 degre weather next time i will probabl choos anoth restaur to visit when it time to paus the saturday activ and have a bite to eat in a live set instead ill keep this place on my list when i need a spot for a rowdi night out and i dont need sitdown servicthe food is pretti much ined after dark it turn into a hot sweati ugli trashi danc fest of scari peoplewho want to fightor wors yetfuck

two star becaus it is possibl to day drink here and surviv but for the love of god as soon as the sun goe down run runargh i thought i would be the first to review this place

whil sit at the bar for lunch on saturday i actual look at my husband and said i wish yelp had half star sinc he is not a yelper himself he was thorough confus by this comment i explain to him that i realli want to give templ bar 25 star the reason this place is the definit of averag if you could creat the word averag in restaur form it would be templ bar  sport grill

w order chip and salsa lame i know but there realli wasnt anyth betterand they never came it wasnt a big deal sinc the mediocr food came pretti quick i mean there were onli 3 tabl with peopl on a saturday so i would hope the food come quick but how do you forget chip and salsa

mi husband had a mediocr burger and i had a mediocr chicken sandwich the food is edibl but not good i wouldnt mind come back for drink but i would never depend on get my next meal at templ bar it also smell like stale beer where we were sitting

i cant imagin that this place will make it the real estat has got to be pretti expens on the corner of bell and thompson peak parkway and the place was virtual empti should have been a sign the food is not good and clear the servic isnt either sinc they cant rememb to bring chip and salsa the chip and salsa did manag to make their way onto our bill which we quick point out and was resolv but you cant have small mistak like that when there are 8 peopl total in your restaurant

i wish i had more posit thing to say about this placetheir patio is great but there no shade i mean come on did peopl from seattl design the patio it arizona you cant have a patio with metal furnitur and zero shademeh ive experienc better ive been here a few time and would have to say for everi time i enjoy my visit the next coupl of time i dont enjoy my visit mayb im cranki becaus for the last 3 night in a row ive been less than happi with my venu choices

mi wife was hungri and want to order right away but i insist that we get our drink first it been my experi that if you order your drink and meal at the same time it take forev to get your drink especi sinc there were onli two server work dure a pack hous dure monday night footbal sure enough it took some time to get our drink but at least our server was easi on the eye and seem to care about her customers

th food is sometim good but it normal not the greatest i want to tri a burger but our server said that they couldnt guarante medium so i decid to get a reuben the reuben was passabl but i forgot to ask them not to put so much freak thousand island on the sandwich dont get their philli sandwich the last time i had it it tast like it was expir they at least replac the philli sandwich with anoth item

i think the best way to enjoy templ bar is to onli drink the adult beverag while sit out on the gorgeous patioa buffet with a view that the extent of paradis garden that view is strict a daytim thing so it seem a major of the patron are here for lunchbrunch it a run of the mill vega buffet with some interest item but is an overal lacklust experience

first timer here might find the space impress becaus it is there arent mani midstrip lower end properti that will offer a spread like this let alon with view of a vibrant garden that essenti the bread and butter of the experi becaus the option and qualiti of the food are subpar enough to have folk second guess their visit

dur the brunch hour there is a bottomless mimosa option which is an attract option for the weekend warrior look to continu their saturday hangov anoth thing i didnt expect was the asian noodl station where one can custom their bowl of noodl soup i made a killer wonton noodl soup  im still shock their crepe station is also a semithumb up but it realli depend on whos make them

th rest of the buffet is a tough to swallow liter anyth fri is instant fail the pizza is almost alway a sure bet for a nothankyou most of the seafood is bland citi and if your shoot for ani of the bbq or mexican fare then bless your appetite

pric arent backbreak for a strip properti at 24 for dinner and brunch other than that it 1520 for everyth els if you happen to be rockin the 24 hour pass then consid pass on the flamingo version of buffetlandi hate this walmart  i hate the fact the last time i need help find someth the associ didnt speak english although she was veri nice and found someon who did  but sinc that person could not have care less to help me i was back to squar one  i hate the fact there are peopl beg for money in the park lot  hello  im at walmart  think about it  i hate the fact it take like an hour to find anyth  and most of all i hate the fact that my husband and i  spent 4 on gas to look for diet dr thunder becaus it 33 cent cheaper than diet dr pepperand they onli had four of them anyway  huhnow that i think about it mayb i belong there806
first visit  happi hour  two roll a philadelphia and a spici salmon roll deepfri with roe on top  most sushi spot glad substitut an ingredi if the regular order contain allergen i cant have without an upcharg  not kabuki  ive had owner chef and cook tell me themselv that if a recip is easili amen theyll glad do the substitut w no offens taken  this kabuki chef isnt one of them  so food photo will reflect these recip omiss  order a glass of hous pinot grigio which had a big black speck float in it but this was quick remedi  

so few hh app and drink to choos from  server were friend enough but sushi chef was visibl annoy full facefront when i had to return a dish as it contain an allergen i request not to be use  i could understand the offens if i had forgotten to includ the info or if i had multipl order that made it hard for him to keep track but a mistak on the second of two dish and with a list of allergen on a note right under your nose as a remind  

atmospher is noth to right home about  i did like the lone red mosaic tile in the women restroom  love the contrast against the allblack themethe 2 previous review want you to believ this is the best mexican parti place around

i must have miss the parti becaus at 12 noon it was complet deadno lunch crowd

and they fail to mention this is in the commerci center plaza a veri scari place to go let alon eat

wel the place is huge seat for 100 peopl and a larg stage plus privat boothes

th chip are hard  flavorless and the salsa too tomatoey and no spice at all no bean either

th price were veri moder and the portion were fair but noth realli special

i order the carn asada plate for 10the carn asada was nice  tender but it was not charbroil as the descript on the menu claimed

th pico was weak and the jalapeno had no spice at all

mi wife had a carn asada taco which was pretti larg and also a chees enchilada which was the highlight of the entir meal

i was disappoint with the cleanli of the place sinc there was no crowd and it was also pretti lacklust food not spici at all

thank good i had a restaurantcom coupon for 10 offi went to sutra to attend the mixer where yelp was be featur after soak in the cool sceney vibe i decid that i was hungri i ask the waitress for a menu when she came back she told me that the right hand side of the menu was half off and made a coupl suggest i love the name of the roll that sutra has there were select like cougar and 30k millionair i had one of each as if the roll were made to live up to their namesak they didnt impress me they mere annoy me the lack of fresh and flavor were the biggest factor in sutra failur i end up leav plenti of sushi on my plate but i was reliev that they were half off otherwis i would have return them upon first bite 

i would not eat at sutra again if i had a choic i would advis you to eat elsewher and come to sutra to see and be scenei have been to samba a hand of time over the past five year it has never been at the top of my list for restaur to attend in fact the onli reason i have attend this restaur the last few time we have gone is becaus of a groupon 2 and becaus a group of friend want to go i feel like this place is on it last leg 

from start to finish it was a constant blunder we show up at 645 on a sunday night and they were slam the hostess said she would definit have us seat by 710 i didnt ask for such specif but okay cool 

we wait in the empti bar we were the onli two peopl there it took our bartend 15 min to get us a glass of wine and a mojito i sat there wait to pay anoth 10 min when the bartend final took my card she sat it down on her cut board where they slice the fruit and proceed to finish make two more drink for other tabl she call me sweet and honey sever time which i found veri disrespect she final back my alcohol and juic cover credit card end of that stori 

the hostess final come to seat us at 720 we sit down and the waiter show up after about a five min wait i order a glass of wine about 20 min later we had to ask for it again our waiter then tell us he has a larg section and he is sick im sorri but i dont realli feel like get sick either i serious question the health practic there 

the food is pretti static it grill meat and a fanci salad bar it realli not bad the flank steak parmesan pork and lamb are all pretti decent 

the place is a littl pricey coupl glass of wine two dinner and tip will put you over 100 the wine by the glass are weak      daili lunch  dinner buffet      

bare resist the great smashburg right next door i drop into genghi here for some mongolian style lunch buffet today

t servic from martika was friend  i load up my lunch bowl with a varieti of meat from the select of fourteen  includ various form of chicken beef pork and seafood  i particular enjoy be abl to toss in bacon  scallop     

over in the fruit veggi egg etc area i select numer treat includ a top favorit chines snow pea pile my bowl up as high as i could without ani spill out onto the tray for which the sign say they would charg you extra     o

for cook sauc this time i went with a cup of khanzu  a cup of dragon after tast them plus a littl garlic water

at the end of the helpyourself line you select starch  one with the smallest bowl two with a medium which i had or three with a larg  i chose fri rice  rice noodl which the chef cook  combin with the content of the bowl you turn in  then pretti soon your new larger bowl contain everyth cook is brought to your table

i like this locat a littl more than the one on bell rd but less than either of the ycs mongolian grill locat i have visit  the dine room comfort was ok not great and the food came out tast ok but it was greasi  it also rather expens for what your getting

smal  899
medium  1099
larg or unlimit small bowl  1399the bad review are pile up here for a reason  be a big fan of batali show on food network i was realli excit about get a chanc to eat at carnevino  unfortun this was the biggest culinari disappoint ive experienc in a long time  first of all i know it vega but this place is horribl overpr for what you get  if im order 40 pasta entre they better be some of the most rich incred pasta ive ever had  i had the black fettuccin with crab instead it tast like someth i could whip up myself on a monday night use about 2 worth of ingredi  actual scratch that it didnt tast like someth i would whip up becaus i wouldnt have made it so bland  anoth member of our group near sent his pasta back becaus it was too salti overwhelm ani other flavor present  their famili style portion 40 were what i would expect a half portion to be  the half portion 17  24 were appetizers and cannot be consid a meal  i am a 170 pound male not a larg person  if this is what mario batal consid to be full size portion i serious wonder how he can stay so overweight 

we order sever 9 side with our meal and all of them were just ordinari  noth stood out  veri averag  no flavor  there was onli one entre that someon els order that look impress to me and that was the veal chop  big 2 thick and practic hang off the plate with the bone in  unfortun not mani peopl in our parti order meat dish which is the general theme of the restaur so i guess the moral is if you do decid to go here stay away from the pasta and go with the meat  

the wine list as note by other below is veri extens but offer few if ani reason price options

al in all it was a twocours meal that took 3 hour  two cours took 3 hour  i dont know what was take so long in the kitchen but we were die by the end  and still hungri after drop 100 per person  i gave the review 2 star instead of 1 becaus the waitstaff were veri profession and i at least felt like i was dine at a 5star restaur even if the food didnt reflect that

i left carnevino crave some macaroni grill bad  that should speak volum  if you want to drop some big buck on a nice italian meal in vega look elsewherhappi and fat 

the oper word that come to mind when i hear the name mario batali sad the overpr lacklust fare at carnevino onli made me the latter but as a disclaim it has been quit a while sinc my visit here so hope theyv made some improv sinc then 

locat in the palazzo carnevino semifail from the getgo while it maintain the topnotch custom servic and decad chic decor expect of a highend vega establish the ambienc was mar by the raucous sound of beasti boy blar from the stereo system im not neccessarili oppos to them but the like of intergalat and sabatog didnt jive well with the upscal environ  

the menu was sneaki too so watch out case in point the price list for the pasta rang from 1731 howev these are for appet portion onli an addit 15 need to be tack on for the entre size also the steak for two is list as 72 but it 72 per person make it a whop 144  a steak legitim worth that much wouldnt be for eat as it should be plate in precious metal and embed with swarvoski crystals

w end up order the bison carpaccio  fri calamari appet 16oz bonein new york strip grill sweetbread  pork milanes pretti much all the main cours fail and for an establish that boast the highestqu excel prepar steak i was serious expect more than the the chewi bland new york strip that was serv the appet were actual pretti good and id recommend get the bison capaccio but other than that the highlight of the meal were the complimentari chees puff  the bread wbutter  pepper lard 

needless to say this was a sad way to start out our trip in vega luckili our night of debaucheri at xs later on that night made up for it two starthey say good thing dont last well my friend sad it true carn vino has sunk food is good but not as good as it was in the past and the servic stink 

i cant tell you how disappoint i was on my last trip to carn vino in vega this from my favorit restaur in vega for mani mani year 

a year ago my husband and i move to london and have endur a hard year of veri few good steak and at price that dont allow for mani outing so on our trip to the us this year we were die for red meat and had to make a trip to carn vino oh yes that glorious gigant fred flinston size ribey and ny mouthwat good oh yessssss and i love the amaz pasta that are also serv here combin the two and oh babi bring it

know how busi the place get we made our reserv well in advanc here is a summari of how they proceed to let me down 

mishap 1  60 min howev upon arriv we had to wait well over an hour to be seat even with a reserv we wait patient know food bliss was await us

mishap 2  30 min after be seat we had to wait anoth 30 minut befor anyon came to take our drink order this is shock sinc the tabl around us were empti i have no idea what the waiter was busi do but it was clear not his job

mishap 3  30 min and then anoth 30 min for someon to come to talk to us about the menu the waiter was a real piec of work he was realli out of it not pay attent to what we were ask and so differ from the servic wed had in the past 

disappoint after final get someth to drink and order we all anxious await our starter the feel that the night was not go to end well start to sink in when the starter arriv and were not as good as i rememb the dozen time ive been in the past i shook this off and wait for the pasta which i knew would be heaven

mishap 4 instead of our pasta cours arriv next  we got our main meat cours we flag down our waiter who was no where to be found for 1015 min and ask him what happen and he admit he made a mistak and didnt put the starter cours in for us im not sure how he manag to mess up sinc we seem to be his onli table

mishap 5 short after this half the pasta cours made it to the tabl along with the manger who proceed to argu with us over excus for their mess up instead of just admit the mistak i have never seen a manag behav so childish in a restaur and youd think youd get a some nice servic at a place were your spend 250 per person for 8 peopl the waiter score big time with a fat servic includ tip although he did not deserv a dime of it 

bottom line is i dont think this review realli tell you how bad the servic was the servic was horribl and the manag should be fire but i admit i still thought the food was good  although sad not as good as wed had in the past 

weve had a few friend also go there sinc and they have also said they had horribl servic and subpar food i dont know if i feel better know it was just not a fluke night i realli use to love this place

i write this review broken heart i hope mario read this and goe and kick the butt out of the manag and staff with his orang croc shoe to get them to live up to the glori that this place onc represwhenev i have guy friend in town and they ask me where a good place to pick up chick i send them here walltowal vega girl stumbl around in their slutti finest guzzl sick sweet giant martinishap alcohol aberr involv shit like marshmallow and copious amount of various syrup score here is like shoot fish in a barrel you cant go wrong and if you get bore there are plenti of other drunklocaltrimpack bar nearbi all comfort nestl within stumbl distanc in the safe valiumch fake that is town square
for the ladi id recommend this place if you like super sweet ginormotini and hord of local douchebag on the prowl for puss good lucki came here for a meetupcom happi hour event on 106 the host of the event advis me to check in at the front for my ladi onli vip card when i arriv i was greet by a brunett at the host station who didnt even bother to say hello let alon give a smile she state i had to be a nevada card holder to get the vip card i am not realli sure how that make sens sinc they have numer locat around the area but a free drink coupon isnt worth ruin my mood when go to hang with a bunch of peopl i have never met before

i attempt to ask if anyon els from meetup had arriv she just state um well i think someon might be here but youd have to look around  

thank when i walk on to the patio a group of femal spot the fact that i look like a deer in headlight and i was abl to find where i need to be onc the host arriv she took over quit a few tabl out on the patio they allow us to take up about 45 tabl and the waitress who was help us was veri friend and accommodating

mi low review is by no mean due to her servic i felt she kept my drink full and was super friend i wish i rememb her name but she was a tini littl pixi asian femal with beauti long hair she even recommend i check out golden spike to be honest she was probabl the save grace for whi i gave this place two star at all

th drink were ok noth special and if it wasnt half off for happi hour i would have stop at one i tri the shrimp martini dont bother get that it onli 4 shrimp and not includ in the happi hour appet special so it was 12 i basic spent 400 per shrimp for a tasteless littl tidbit

som of the other member of my group got the chicken skewers

i enjoy the down dirti martini and the cucumb martini but the bus boy took my cup befor i got to actual eat my cucumb which also didnt help this place becom somewher i want to return

th cake pop martini is super cute but the tast is like sweet milk and just wasnt for me

overal this place is worth it if you are go with a good group of peopl and you are prepar for the fact servic can be spotti i can total see if i had a bad waitress how terribl wrong thing could go as they have rule about split the tab but our waitress was great about take cash they did add on the 20 gratuiti automat sinc it was such a larg group even though they gave separ check person i felt like that was lame to do without advis us not to mention it short the waitress out of larger tip becaus i was so taken a back by the fact they ad it on now dont get me wrong i still show her love for be good at her job but the manag of this place need to get everyon on board to provid good service

th patio was nice and over all it is a good place to sit out and enjoy the compani of peopl check it out but i would not pay a cover for this placei was stoke when this place open yay sushi without drive 20 minut to anoth town

mi enthusiasm was shortliv quit frank the qualiti is spotti sometim the sushi is great sometim it blow you never know which your go to get until your alreadi eat it and by then it too late on my first visit i ask the bartend for a maitai and he didnt know how to make it that a pretti typic sushi bar drink right

i would often pop in alon and sit at the sushi bar where the waitress tend to forget your aliv ive order drink and edamam and been serv and eaten my sushi befor either of the aforement even arrived

i total avoid the tepanyaki tabl whi would i pay upward of 30 a person for what essenti friend rice 

after three mediocr experi in a row ive given updear breadfruit 
 we becam acquaint on the internet like so mani relationship these day do and i must admit that i becam fascin with you quick your menu sang to me with so mani tasti word and your locat couldnt be better 

we final met last night and i am disappoint while you have a veri cheeri atmospher and wonder staff your food just didnt woo me at all the fish was overcook burn on the endseven and left me unsatisfi the slaw look promis but prove to be near imposs to eat you tri pick up long string of cabbag and bean sprout just see what happen and the breadstick oy the tast of it was fantast but it was so overdon that i thought for a second that i might have to send you a dentist bill if i finish it 

mi dine companion was enamor with your curri tofu sad the one bite of his tofu end up be the highlight of my meal sigh 

i wish that thing had turn out better breadfruit becaus i realli want to like you but when visit you leav me hungri for the hole in the wall caribbean place on camelback and 35th ave i know that it just isnt go to work out 

good luck to you

ye the mango fish roll httpwwwyelpcombizphotosthebreadfruitphoenix2selectkklpgd3aa5bpvwdonaufygkklpgd3aa5bpvwdonaufyg were definit crispi and tast delici and yes the ovenroast plantain httpwwwyelpcombizphotosthebreadfruitphoenix2selectqjpbnwkko0gme66g9w2taqjpbnwkko0gme66g9w2ta were firm on the outsid and justlikebuttah on the insid but were they worth 1050 and 5 plus tax respect  i dont think so  i took photo of the food w a pen next to the plate to show you how small these portion were  realli 12 for a small mango fish roll slice threeway  and im suppos to feel good about order an entre and dessert after

th sweet potato puddn httpwwwyelpcombizphotosthebreadfruitphoenix2selectghufceowcgwschxrw8zmvaghufceowcgwschxrw8zmva was just absolut fabul but you wont catch me drive all the way to the breadfruit to spend my hardearn money here  at least i know theyv reinvest some of the profit into remodel the place it look fifti time better than when it did on it first year of open  if you wish to dine and convers w your companion it best not to come here on the weekend when next door rum bar is hop  then again mayb it was just hop on this night bec of the rumtast event held there  i havent been back sinc so i dont know how busi these two busi aremy husband jamaican and i were veri excit to tri the breadfruit especi after read so mani rave review sad the best part of our experi and meal was the drink which turn this review into a 2star instead of 1 

even with a halfempti dine room at 8pm on a weekday we were told they did not have a tabl avail and had to wait half an hour at which point we were escort into the now nearempti dine room 

our appet and entre were bland with onli hint of jamaican flavor and serv lukewarm  hubbi had a upset stomach and touch of queasi a coupl hour after dinner 

the concept of the restaur is great but i recommend anyon visit the breadfruit should go for happi hour and get the rum punch or other tasti cocktail and skip the food  then you might not be disappoint  this was my second visit to blue adob and i wont be back the first visit was for a famili birthday dinner about 10 peopl and they had troubl coordin our tabl goof up our order and general didnt seem to care about us much at all but the food was tasti onc they got it right so i thought id tri again with the evfn group

two of the staff seem tri to help but everyon els either ignor us or seem inconvenienc by all of us order dinner and drink what a mess

now i know the servic problem wasnt a fluke it seem to be a restaur live on a veri good cook skill in the kitchen and those skill are the onli reason it isnt get a singl star for good new mexican style food id suggest los dos molino not too far awayi was among the larg group sever other review mention that visit blue adob grill the point they made in their review were right on the money becaus of that ill keep this short and add just a few more

th one server take care of the group was hit and miss he paid attent to some and seem to ignor other i was encourag him to go around the tabl to take each order but instead would take one at a time back to the kitchen and ignor other as he was walk away not veri effici still he was tri so ill give him that one of the two star abov goe to him

i share a chicken quesadilla and bean queso dip appet noth complic but it was good the plate other had look appet also  when and if they ever got them that account for the second star

th manag walk up to me at one point near the end of our visit i was stand by our assign 4 tabl chat with anoth person in our group in an annoy voic she said im go to have to ask you to not crowd the other tabl  i was 3 feet away from the next tabl  i count the tile on the floor just to make sure is 3 feet consid crowding
  
those three blank star lack of followthrough lack of servic and lack of account by the managthese farreach god of cafetopoli you see 

whose minion such as paneracl and chipotl have erect from sea to sea

desir like the vendor beyond the acropoli offerings

cafeteria dine serv gyro and mani such things



th fare was befit of abov mention ilk

two star at best though servic was silk

th dolomad came hard the hummus was tasty

spanakopita came fri as the cook may be hasty

falafel were shape as tatertot would

pasti insid the two were not good



salad lack oliv but for a dollop all ground

feta was spars with no pungenc found

drachma went quick when food was just ordered

high qualiti greek food the price could have afforded


english majorswa that iambic pentameti ate here dure restaur week and it was accept the set is love without question the decor is impecc but the food was just ok if it wasnt restaur week price i think i wouldv been disappoint i had the rock shrimp cevich which was top with too much mediocr guacamol the swordfish was simpl and cook veri well simpl is a good thing with fish in my opinion it had good flavor i realli enjoy the tomato that accompani it  the fingerl potato were accept though they could have use a bit more season my dessert baba au rhum was ok i notic none of these item except the fingerl are on the regular menu but it seem youd put your best foot forward dure restaur week when you can count on some new custom who have been look for an excus to tri your restaur to seiz the moment in this case they didnt creat a new regulari should have known that an italian restaur with a french name would be bad news  it just the start of the ident crisi go on

i dont realli get what theyr tri to do here  are they aim to be an upscal restaur  becaus the server in tshirt and the stripper pole place throughout the dine room dont realli lend themselv to that  and yes i said stripper pole metal pole place in between two leather arm chair  the menu suggest they are tri to go in the direct of casual upscal but the qualiti of food and servic doesnt support that  

i ask our server for a suggest for a light dri non minerali white wine  i got a veri oakey butteri heavi white  total what i ask for thank  overal the wine list was unimpress howev i did like the fact that you can order a quartino  i was underwhelm by the servic our server would disappear for long stretch of time and serv me the salad my friend order in addit to serv the wrong beer to the wrong peopl he also seem to be lack knowledg on the food that we order tell my husband that the soup had pancetta flavor when it actual had pancetta in it  other member of my parti had their flatwar replac after use their knife for bread and butter while i did not  it was spotti servic all around  

the qualiti of the food did not make up for the poor servic  two peopl in our parti order the scallop a bostonian and a new orleanian who are use to great scallop  we both agre they were pretti aw  veri much overcook veri chewi  scallop should not be chewi you should not have to work at eat them they should just melt in your mouth  not to mention one of the scallop was a bit sandi and obvious had not been proper clean  i know i know stupid me i shouldnt order seafood in the desert  especi after eat amaz seafood for a week in ny  the glace that they were serv in had an extrem strong black licoric flavor  i am not a fan of black licoric in fact i know nobodi that is  the veget that accompani the scallop were limp  the aforement soup that my husband order did not have quit the right consist due to the presenc of the extrem hard pancetta which detract from the textur of the bean  his salad was ok it did come with huge flake of toast garlic which fool him as he thought they were almond flake  

when ask if we would like dessert one my friend threw down an emphat no just the check becaus the whole experi was just sub par and no dessert nor digestif could possibl save it

just as a side notei know that im a short girl but i hate it when i go to restaur and sit on bench and my feet dont touch the ground  it make me feel stupid  

the food the servic the atmospherewhatev it is that they are aim for just isnt workim in  a quandari about scratch
i walk over there for lunch todaymi first time tri out scratch
th note on the counter said pleas be seat so ok i sat at the communal tabl in the middl of the room and waitedand waitedand wait ten minut by my watch nobodi behind the counter or take food out look at me or acknowledg me so i decid i must be do it wrong i walk up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that no we wait on you but he nice took my order sandwich and coke and let me pay btw i includ a 20 tip up front when i paid with my card so i was tri to be proactiv about get good servicelesson learn and said they would bring thing out
i waitedand i waitedand i wait while sever peopl came in seat themselv were brought place mat utensil ice water and their order taken and their drink order brought out 
i final walk back up to the counter and ask to at least get my drink orderprofus apolog from the man behind the counter gave me a bottl of coke which turn out to be frozen solid anoth trip to the counter 
bi this time you can onli smile at the comedi of error they final brought me a place mat and the rest no ice water never show up and then final the sandwich
i suppos the sandwich which was good on good bread well made and tasti is the reason to give scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 star the servic was below 1 star
th littl salad they serv with the sandwich was fresh and the vinaigrett was tasti so that was nice as well
wa it 1100  tip for a small sandwich good well that is my quandari i think at that kind of price point the sandwich need to be terrif not just good and the servic should at least be adequ and it was nowher near adequate
so 2 star for now and mayb i will go back and tri it again in a few month25 star realli ive been hold off on the review becaus i stun myself by pay 650 for a macaroon realli i did that ugh it was tasti but 650 

and that not even count my breakfast 9 for a wedg of quich and a salad that i didnt want  i just want a piec of quich 

i dont mind pay for good food anyon who know me know food is pretti much what i spend my money on  but im have huge buyer remors over my meal someth not right with thatdear owner whi did you stop at 68 i suggest you ad one more number  as we all know the pho busi is quit competit especi in this asian mecca of town  surviv on cheesi and pervert market i say 

pleas redeem yourself it just embarrass restor honor in the name of the pho communiti which extend all the way to socal  

it was this 2star recip that i observed

1 ad a dash of black pepper befor my pho bowl arriv who doe that trust me nobodi in my pho eat career have i seen this  you either a believ your broth lack flavor b thought it was cool and tri to be differ if need we can use the shaker that was alreadi sit on the tabl clear a pho faux pas

it threw everyth off  slurp after slurp was quit pain  the ident of the broth was more evid onc i ad the hoisin and siracha blandish  henc the bp face palm

2 empti tabl and chair  clear this was a dead giveaway but i was semi hope that the pho god would bring me good tast fortun on this great sunday afternoon face palm

3 servic was so sloooow i thought at sever point time itself had stop  in comparison to some legendari viet place i know i get my cup of water the second i sit down or atleast within reason time  10 minut befor take order 10 more minut for beverag to arriv face palm

if you are truli a pho place it shouldnt take you more than 10 minut to deliv a bowl of pho  in fact the veget took just as long to come out  the antifresh did not help either you would think be direct link to an asian groceri would help in that regard  face palm

no excus for slow when the place is half full

anoth thing pleas invest in better rooster and hoisin sauc not your mysteri generic bottl  face palm

al of this face palm has caus my face to go numb the onli way i would return is if a one was ad to the restaur number  by then i would expect an enhanc in the food and possibl a scandal atmospher 

sorri not worth the 7 bone and someth cent  for now on i will decid whether to risk my appetit by factor 2 sigh heed epic fail the endmy brotherinlaw and i drop in here between microbrew stop on our littl tour of vega microbrew  as best as i can recal it was around 1130 at night and we realiz that besid a light meal we split earlier in the even we hadnt had dinner  after leav sin citi brew and walk around debat where to go next hunger crept up on us

when this happen we were in front of harrah  so we walk in and ambl our way around to the cafe at harrah  the price were reason and the food was reason mediocr  we each had a 12 sandwich and bowl of soup

our servic was bizarr  we were sit caddi corner and the waiter first approach from behind both of us silent appear like dracula from out of nowher  the rest of the meal he would onli arriv in this manner  when he left the check i put it out on the tabl where he would have to come to the front of the tabl to reach it  after he had walk by sever time without pick it up i suggest that mayb he would onli get it if it were on the corner between us and he could grab it  from behind  i move it there and within a moment he slip up from behind and nab it  by this time we were refer to him as our backdoor friendi wasnt feel this at all  we met up with a coupl of friend and one said this was his spot  my wife like cafe rio a lot too

theyr famous for their sweet bbq pork which wouldv been greatin a barbecu sandwich the sweet was too much and realli weird in a burrito even weirder in the salad my wife got  i would just go with the fire grill steak or chicken if i could do it all over

i also dislik how they wouldnt put guacamol in the actual burrito itself  i was given a teeni weeni scoop of the incred hulk tv seri color avocado on the side  that was gross  mexic mexidont mexiwont

a coupl of thing save cafe rio from 1 star and that the qualiti of the tortilla and the drink station  their fresh tortilla could possibl be the best by a mexican fast food chain and the biggest reason i may give it anoth shot  the drink station is bigger than the usual and includ horchata limead and various teayou know what realli fuck up about this place it consist for instanc if you eat in the dine room you get a burrito so damn big that you cant finish it serious this thing was humong and pretti much full on burrito mad it tast alright veri  in line with chipotl or ani other shitti corpor burrito joint noth special i assur you except for it girth  

so on our return trip to there airport we deic to get a burrito but this time order it from the counter instead and had it to go we deic that we would onli order 1 sinc they are so damn big im not sure if in the 2 day that we gone and came back they had some serious chang or what this burrito was so chicken shit and terribl small we wonder if there was a problem kid size mayb anyway of cours i ask and was told that was the normal togo size 

that pretti much bullshit anyway you cut it if your go to sell a burrito sell the same one whether you dine in or take out so if your in a pinch like we were order your food in the dine room from a waiter not togobarack obama ate here  that right bitch the next pressi had a burger here  this from the owner mouth

at ani rate man did i want to love this place unfortun my burger was over cook  the season was great so i think it was just my bad luck  i will go back  but here the real reason to eat here it fuck cheap  5 get you a burger fri and a coke  you cant beat thati like seafood i like pizza so i order the seafood pizza big mistak i had been wait about 20 minut for it when the waitress inform me that it didnt look good and shed ask the cook to start over it didnt look good what doe that mean sound like she was look out for me though so i didnt complain well i dont know what the first one look like but it couldnt have been good if it look wors than the second one which arriv anoth 20 minut later kind of look like soup seafood pizza soup the sauc 1 part tomato sauc  3 part water was actual drip off the plate i tri to pull out a slice and all i got was soggi crust becaus all the top chees includ slid right off and land with a splash the shrimp were mushi like littl bad banana the squid i think it was squid but i dont know that for sure tast like pencil eras realli gross that right that no typo that gross with a capit gwent back again last week the menu has improv but the servic seem to have gotten wors our waitress disappear for over 20 minut after bring us the wrong check i was final abl to flag her down and tell her about the check onli to wait anoth 15 minut for her to return noth ruin a perfect nice dine experi like a 45 minut wait for the billspecial 3 item combo 899  3 margarita plus chip  salsa plus bean dip for freeat all stationcasinos

w visit palac station around 10pm friday even and there was no wait to be seat dure the unlvmbb game 

servic was fast  friend bring drink  chipssalsa out almost immedi i order my regular the carn asada fajita and the wife got a 3 item combo of beef enchiladabeef taco and someth mexican

a you can see from what pictur not what you think when you think fajita right im think slight saute pepper  onion  medium rare fine slice carn asada with tortilla pico and sour creamguac on the side mayb even some cilantro and hot sauce

r cheap and cheesi meat was tough and not marin like youd expect didnt even touch the rice  bean just didnt pass the look test 

sidenot  the side picosour creamguac were in the same small bowl and water togethernot veri cool either

how this place has fail to find someon to cook good mexican food in las vega boggl the mindi stood for a long time wait to be notic just so i could get seat they seem veri short staf and the hostess was run around tend to tabl and didnt notic the peopl wait our server was great poor dude was run around tri to keep up with all the tabl but with them all full and bare ani help it was hard i had a hard time get someth to even drink when i was first seat and get a refil was even harder 

the complimentari chip and bean dip are great howev the salsa are nasti my wife and i share some con queso dip and that was the best part of the meal veri cheesi and lot of flavor i had fajita and they were not cook how i ask some of the meat was still raw and the rest was tough onli get 3 tortilla my whole meal was complet crap too i couldnt even catch my server to ask that the fajita be remad becaus he was out of sight or rush food to a differ tabl the bean that came with my meal were also hard cabo need to get more employe on hand so thing can run more smoothword that best way i can say it ive had better 

i realli had crazi high hope for staci pull up to the former corner store i could smell the smoke in the air and felt my hope rise even further away from me i wasnt sure what i was expect but i knew i want it to be good 

walkin in i saw the they love on yelp sticker and was so glad staci is good and unfortunat he know it we look over the sign and wasnt sure what to get my mom order the small beef sandwich with onion ring i start to order but then stop my self and was given a smart ass remark from the cashier my bad dang ummm let me get the larg pork sandwich with sweet fri and small cole slaw and grape koolaid our order came to near 20 for a simpl lunch

w wait and sat and heard some slime businessmen talk about titti cigar and car shudder overhear their convers made me regret be straight gag our food was brought to our tabl and i was underwhelm 

the fri look limp and lifeless like they were rememnt from the past lunch hour not at all crunci or flavorful besid the sugari cinammon sprinkl atop them the sandwich was okay but just okay it remind me of manwhich with extra liquid smoke the cole slaw was uninspir who knew cole slaw need inspir it need heavi dose of pepper and a kick of salt to be decent the koolaid was too sweet to drink and i wound up chug a third of it befor ad some water to it and then was abl to ward off diabet coma for that day 

mi mom like her sandwich but didnt like that it was soo small she was realli disappoint but like the flavor and want more she also like her onion ring i had a coupl and they were good i want to give it anoth go becaus so mani peopl like it it has to be good right it could have been a bad day or someth im realli hope it was becaus base off of my experi best bbq in the citi hardthe fall from sushi grace 
kampai use to be my favorit sushi restraunt there fish was veri high qualiti and purchas fresh everyday now kampai is simpli meteocr the new owner have complet chang the menu sushi chef and the qualiti of fish has gone down drastic honest i would not go back to kampai now base on price alon they are just to expens for the low qualiti food that is serv now less is definit more as far as the old kampai goe their menu was simpl and so were the ingredi in the roll if you do choos to tri out the downgrad kampai i suggest the spici tuna roll and the vega roll both are decent tast this sushi restraunt has noth special to offer it consum anymor if you have been loyal to kampai you will see how bad a mistak the origin owner made when they decid to sell also kampai is now open all the time so you can eat their crappi food almost anytim of the day nowsorri to say this nextdoor bbq spot is lacking

i have tri it three time now each time i find myself wonder whi i am here again the decor is just plain sad someth between a fast food taco shop and a dollar store the servic is slow realli slow

pop by here for the last time on saturday night with my kid two halfrack of overcook rib and three mac and chees order with a can of diet coke set us back over 40 which i would have glad paid at joe waldo or even famous dave to be fair  on my first visit and when they still seem to care my pull pork sandwich was decent

i realli want this place to do well sinc i can walk here but ala it seem they are bare hang on and cut corneri was super stoke when i realiz there was a bbq joint close to my offic too bad it just ok

i couldnt realli tell the differ in tast or look between the pull pork and the brisket  serious  it was weird  the spici bbq sauc is garbag and liter look and tast like ketchup with hot sauc ad  bunk  the lemonad was surpris veri wateri and bland  the side of bean was ok noth special  nextit pain me to give retro a two star review 

it like throw my hand in what look like a jar of honey onli to have it come out bloodi becaus it was actual a jar of thumbtacks

thi morn i order a bunch of cupcak to have deliv to some veri special busi colleagu not to methi is import to note

deliveri to the las vega strip run about 20 fine no big deal here is the thing that ground my gearsth cupcak were deliv without the special note that i left for the colleagu and on top of that they were address to me 

cupcak are not cheap nor is the deliveri i put a lot of faith into retro becaus of all of the posit yelp review perhap i shouldv research a bit more about their deliveryservic 

the onli redeem factor is that the cupcak were delici per the recipients

to retroim not sure if this was an honest mistak or not but pleas take extra care of your client who requir deliveri servic 

i know that i will hesit to use retro when it come time to make an order for valentin day sorrihave heard so mani good thing about this place i want to give it a shot the main thing that kept me from eat there is the realli good taco shop just down the street and anoth good restaur 3 door down from yayo coupl that with the fact that i didnt realiz it was yayo that had the crowd and such when eat at the other place i thought it was a differ establishment

i digress

it was a midweek late lunch when the wife and i final gave yayo a go it was a relat nice blusteri day so the door were all wide open let the natur light in while the wind help to keep the place from be too hot inside

th menu look small at first on the display board then we were hand full menus still not huge just a singl side of a piec of paper a step or two up from legal size paper the revers side is their beer list a huge huge beer list

deb between their offer i settl on the chicken nacho which is one of my gaug of a mexican restaur if you can screw up chicken chees and chip i dont want to give you a chanc with anyth else

al of their nonbeer drink were singl serv bottl or can includ water which is kind of ridicul then ice tea was suggest given the weather a nice cup of ice tea sound like it would hit the spot

find a seat in the eclect decor handmad look wood furnitur featur dine area near the door we enjoy the breez over a las vega weekly

with a desir to quench my thirst i took a sip of the tea whi do place fail to mention when it is flavor tea i am not a fan of most flavor tea so get a jasmin infus assault on my tast bud liter left a bad tast in my mouth

aft a reason wait my nacho came out the gentleman deliv them was veri apologet for the wait explain they had to melt the chees etc it was refresh to see someon feel bad for take a reason amount of time where most place act put off when you ask them whi it took an hour for service

start with some of the out chip i dove in the qualiti of the chip and chees made it seem like flavor tea would be the worst part of the meal and then i got to the chicken

perhap i should have guess if the tea was go to be flavor the chicken may have had someth off with it as well the best way i can describ the chicken is that it had a mediterranean or middl eastern essenc to it if i was eat at paymon i would have complet understood the flavoring

onc i scrape all of the chicken off the rest of the nacho were delici save for the bit that had absorb some of the funki chicken flavoring

if i am in the mood just for some meatless nacho and have someth to drink in my pocket i may go back the qualiti of food was good the ambianc was welcom some of the flavor though i wouldnt give the chicken or tea a second chancuntil last night visit to the yardhous i was a big fannow im not so sure here why

a good friend and his fianc were visit from california and want to get togeth for dinner  drink  sinc town squar is locat on the strip it was a conveni place for us to meet  over the past few week ive been drink a lot of ipa and chimay and was tell him that the yardhous would be a great place for him to give them a tri  sinc they dont have a yardhous where he live in california we were all veri excited

th better half and i met them at the yardhous  it was pretti pack for a sunday even but we were abl to find 4 spot at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seat immedi  after brows the beer menu we decid on a stone ipath bartend said they no longer had it  ok how about the long hammer ipa  nopeno longer carri it  he proceed to tell me they onli had 1 or 2 of the ipa on the menu becaus they are in the process of switch out the menuwhat  wtf is that  i understand chang out the menu but not be abl to offer what you have list until you make the changethat bs  especi for a place that claim to have 100s of beer on tap  okwel if that the case we ask for a chimay tripleguess what  they didnt have any

at this point i was a littl embarrass becaus i hype up this place as a solid go to place to enjoy new brew and good food  we settl for a ranger ipa and call it a day

for food we order hot wing 4 chees pizza jambalaya and slider  the pizza was veri soggi even though i order it well donethat the second time weve had pizza and it come out soggyw wont order it again  the rest of the food was good but not great

overal it was a disappoint night at the yardhous  there are ton of place in vega that serv good bar food but came here specif for beer that were not availableand that suppos to set them apart from the rest  i hope this was an anomali and not the begin of a trendokay there are a few thing that are go to be brought up and im almost guarante to get a manag comment on this but whatev it happening

w here last night to tri the gardein line here i was veri excit to see that vegan meat have been ad to some of their dish how cool is that but upon do some internet research befor we order i found out that due to cook method all of the dish wouldnt be vegan or vegetarian they cook everyth on the same grill as the meat what sens doe this make none it like have a black coat and put bleach all over it  it doesnt resembl a black coat anymor and is taint if you mix vegan food with meat what is the point 

and here come whi it is 2star it is not standard procedur for the vegn menu to be cook in a separ pan you have to go out of your way to ask for this and even then a manag come out to explain that it not go to tast the same as if it were on the grill hmm  do you realli think a vegan want dead cow mix in with her food hell no grant yardhous has alreadi taken some action and put a littl dot next to a few item that absolut will come in contact with meat sinc these item are fri and have to go in the same basket as everyth els but they havent specifi that all the menu item will come in contact with anim product which is not okay it would be realli help if peopl who come here know this right off the bat if i hadnt had my phone on me that night i liter would have gotten sick sinc i havent had ani sort of meat in 6 year 

here what i would suggest just like other compani befor you chipotl come to mind pleas automat make all the vegetariangardein item cook separ from the meat you dont want a lawsuit a la mcdonald it is ridicul that these vegan meat come to you and then you crosscontamin them with anim sourc to make them not even vegetarian oh and this isnt just for this yardhous it goe for all of them  trust me i will be contact your corpor offic today also it would be nice if you could put a littl v next to the item that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu make order easier and the confus of your staff minimal

anyway i order the veggi slider that come with fri and we also order a side of sweet potato fri matt order a thai chicken pizza after some back and forth the slider couldnt even go on the bread onli the wheat bread is vegan so i got them protein style wrap in lettuc the sweet potato fri we got as our appet were sever lacklust veri bland no tast no top like sugar or anyth we couldnt have the sauc sinc it contain bacon so i guess that where all the flavor is after the aforement back and forth with the wait staff we got our food do they serious onli have the meat and the bun in my case lettuc for the slider noth els no tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard for serious the tast of the gardein patti was wonder but for almost 11 for plain patti is ridicul the fri were way better than the sweet potato one but it just wasnt worth the price i wish they would have suggest to make my order a veggi burger sinc that essenti what they did anyway was cut the patti into four piec and pass them off as slider at least then i could have had the wheat bun and top 

it was veri difficult throughout the night to tri and signal our waitress i know it was veri busi and that i did ask a lot of question and such but she was an expert ninja not the best custom servic in the world i also unfortun dont see this gardein line last here at yardhous until cook the item separ becom standard procedur i can see a lot of vex vegn honest what is the point of have vegan meat if theyr go to end up on the same grill as actual meat i just dont get that logic yardhous itself is a bit pricey and i understand this but at least give the custom the most you can plain slider are not okay in fact i dont think ive been anywher that has complet bare slider 

due to the lacklust food the outrag price tag and the lack of good custom servic yardhous realli deserv a 1star review but i still love that a chain has decid to put vegan faux meat on their menu the intent is there but the execut is aw but can be easili improv upon i might be back sinc there were other item that look appet but onli when i want to deal with the headach and the hassl until then ill stock up on gardein at whole food and make my own delight at homei want to do happi hour befor a night of bing drink so i decid to make reserv at sushi samba for me and my 5 girlfriend on the reserv site i was told that happi hour was serv throughout the restaur which sound perfect becaus we had a big parti and we all know how crowd the bar area can get howev onc we arriv we were told it was at the bar area onli whomp the bar area is super small but we manag to snag a littl tabl and squeez all of our bodi around it not the most comfort seat but itll have to do

w order everyth on their happi hour menu all the dish were about 5 and we want to tri everyth unfortun our waitress came back 3 time just to tell us that they no longer had this item on their happi hour menu bogus i ask whi and she told me that their menu is ever chang and sinc we came on the last day of the month they ran out of ingredi realli  so instead of eat we decid to just drink and ate whatev few thing they did have on happi hour we order some roll off their regular menu and they were all lack a 16 roll with onli 4 piec kind of ridicul wouldnt you agre and it wasnt even all that we left hungri and disappoint luckili we were buzz so we got over it rather quickmy dine experi fell short of my expect consid what we ate or shall i say what we didnt eat compar to what we paid there were 21 of us for dinner and we had the chef select also known as omakas typic you would get the most innov dish order this style  howev we were serv typic menu item  i think it was just a strateg way for them to serv a larger group without have to cater to individu order 

the good was that most of the item we tast were pretti good the bad was that we werent given enough food to tast everyth even though we were all charg the same price  

instead we share each plate of food between 57 peopl which includ the follow 
1 tuna tataki onli got to tri it becaus someon didnt eat raw fish 
2 wagyu beef dumpl not enough brought out so i never got to tri it 
3 mini yellow tail taco  i like the spici foam which ad a nice kick to the citrusey flavor of the dish 
4 crab tempura how ridicul is it that there were onli sever piec to each order so the hub and i had to share one bite of one piec this wouldnt even qualifi as an amusebouch 
5 sea bass and shrimp skewer again not enough so most of us share skewer 
6 steak and mushroom stew everyon got 12 thin slice of beef which was tender and flavor 
7 sushi rollssashimi the sushi roll were the most generous item serv about 5 cut roll but imo were rather underwhelm the sashimi on the other hand was delici and fresh we were given about 3 slice each of yellowtail tuna and salmon which i easili could have eaten by myself

i felt bad for the hub becaus he was still hungri and ask what was be serv next onli to be told that it was just dessert follow by a 2500 bill 240 per coupl 

ye our server was pleasant and friend yes the food was quit tasti  and yes they need to recalcul the amount of food for group order from the chef select sure i expect to pay a lot for this kind of meal but what i didnt expect was to leav unsatisfi and want for morei will have to admit that i was pretti disappoint with circus circus buffet  it was much better than i thought it would be  i came here hope to recalibr my vega buffet meter and i was look for someth that was a 1 or a zero  not to say that there still arent element that put them in the run for the worst buffet i have been to  includ total dri out food item and rude staff

long gone are the day when you could eat here for 5 buck and get the worst case of heartburn in your life anyth that incorpor a meat mixtur tast like they were use offal in their food long befor it becam trendi  but sad the price has gone up to just under 20 for dinner and so has the qualiti  now instead of be horrend they have climb the rank to reach the status of dorm food  just palat and recogniz enough ani place that has milk dispens is guarante to be like dorm food

to summar my find and some of the items

corn dog  dri out and grey wiener just like you find at ampm

slic beef  i need two gulp of water to get this babi down  dri dri dry

fri chicken  greasi and dri out like the hungryman frozen dinners

taco meat  amaz reproduct of the beef fill use in taco bell

burrito  an exact replica of tina 25 cent frozen burritos

lasagna  can we say stouffers

mac n chees  kraft mac n chees is cheesier

and my favorit there is a station that has some stuff just label as meat  awesomi now know about servic it suck 

i was look for a few thing and ask an employe if they had them and if so where do i find it 

one item was bulgur wheat the person i ask did not seem to understand my question so i spell it out for her she had never heard of it and said if we have it  it will be out there somewher as she point in the general direct of the whole store 

on to the next question do you have crystal ginger she said it is in the produc depart i said i do not want fresh but crystal she look at me and onc again said i do not know i never heard of it 

mi thought not express was well dumb ass ask someon who might know but this seem to have been a foreign concept to her as she made no move to do so 

i pick up a few other thing i need and had sever more to find 
that be dill no dill anoth be mint oh they had mint alright it is call live mint it has three leav on it with stem lead to a root ball i was kind of look for mint that can be use today 

i continu on look for item and could not find half of them 

know my level of frustrat and what happen when i reach the top of it i figur i better get out of this place befor i do someth realli stupid so i left and went to safeway and they had everyth i need with great servic in find what i could not 

this is my last visit to sprout it has been a frustrat place to shop for a long time now and i would be even more dumb than folk think i am if i continu repeat these experii realli wish i could give the lpc a better rate but it would not be justifi 

this tini and super cute restaur is onli about a mile away from me and becaus of such i have been here about 5 time although i could give the restaur a 3 star mayb even a 4 star rate on a good day it is everyth els that fall short i have tri the sandwich and veget varieti plate and actual found them both to be flavor and fresh tast 

howev the servic is justaw and the most recent time i would say the servic fell short due to the owner and not the waitress while the waitress seem new she was super friend and attent well as attent as she could be with the owner call her to the back to not surei am sure she was help platecooksometh but that would leav the 6 tabl or so of diner unattend the time befor we were wait on and serv by the owner he seem nice enough but also had to keep tab on the back of the restaur and would be mia for long period of time there is no way that anyon with an hour lunch break could eat here and realist make it back to work on time 

final i have a hard time use the groupon voucher i have purchas here the same day groupon was not accept becaus they alreadi reach their limit for the day hmmm

sad i will not be give the lpc anoth tri but i hope they listen to review on yelp and get back on their gamethe flat food is just okay the best deal is the flat iron steak for under  1000 but the rest of the menu and drink is way over price for what your get as more dine place come to queen creek area this place will be less attractive

pro flat iron steak pit fire danc etc

con overpric menu and drink price for the local area and depend on time to mani kids
        bartend need to be more friend and smile
        custom servic is miss need worklong befor i was yelp is that realli a verb i went to this establish i must confess that i realli did not rememb the experi 

so with famili in town we decid to tri it again befor go i read the review i found myself confus with the mix review but after our experi i now understand 

this restaur is for atmospher onli if you want a good dinner or good steak go somewher els 

now there are two way to eat at this establish 

first 
go to the sit down restaur portion order from menu have food deliv like normal 

second 
sit out at patio yard in back to get food you must go to walk up window order and have food brought out i am not sure if menu for this is the same for restaur or not 

now tonight the saturday befor easter we went to dinner figur that it would be busi we tri to go earli 500 but get there about 30 minut late found that the park lot was alreadi veri full and patio area was pack 

still have some lucki famili gene we found a park spot right in front and were abl to get seat at tabl in restaur side immedi 5 minut later i dont think we would have been that lucki 

so when you see the review about park and long wait i understand their frustrat 

three of the four order rib eye steak the fourth a jack daniel chicken it is pretti tough to screw up a chicken breast so cant comment on that howev the rib eye not worth the 18 price tag veri poor piec of meat and not cook veri well i was up sold on the mushroom which were serv on top this did noth to cover the poor qualiti of meat and poor cook 

now i fanci myself a pretti good cook i make a mean breakfast do well on dinner and do veri well on the grill so anytim i find myself think that i can do better at home i know the food is not veri good 

servic was averag not sure the waitress even gave us her name and was clear too busi with too mani tabl to provid qualiti attent 

mayb on a differ night when thing are not as busi it might be better but if the cut of meat is the same qualiti i dont care what you do to it how good your servic person is or how mani mushroom you put on top it will still tast bad  it will never be worth the 18 price 

three steak dinner one chicken dinner one alcohol drink for each no dessert total bill 11800 includ tip not

i am sure the patio atmospher would be veri fun fire in pit roast marshmallow and often time live music so if you are look for fun place to go with friend to enjoy an even under star this might be the place 

want a good steak or other type meal go somewher elsi agre with some of the other review who have had a tough time rate this place  part of me want to give it three star but i just cant becaus of the averag food high price and overal crazi of the place  

in a nutshel stf is a touristi place with an old west vibe mix with live entertain and fire pits

you will find a mix crowd here  famili with kid and adult out to drink parti and danc  it can be veri busi with kid run all over the place so be prepar for that  

food is averag  i have tri mani thing on the menu and have not found anyth that i could not make better on my own weber grill at home  

last you best drink befor you get there or in the park lot ha ha becaus unless you are order pbr youll be spend a lot of money on boozi was unimpress and im prepar to back up my opinions

 it the weekend and the trophi husband and i are look for a spot to lunch a tasti meal and a drink is in order this should be spot but it is notdamn it damn it damn it i realli want to like you red white and brew i want you to live up to your gilbert is go to be swanki just hang out on this bar stool and drink some overpr wine and watch it happen atmospher the place say hey this could be nice we have a hip look and your staff is hot but it all stop there it was not meant to be 

first the servic is off way off i can forgiv bad servic in fact i can flat out ignor it if the food is good so we are stand around wait to be seat in a complet empti dine area with the waitstaff seat eat their meal and look us with that what the hell are u 2 idiot do look now i get it if it is 3ish and here are 2 nimrod who roll in for the late lunchear dinner but no it is 1pm on a saturday drop the attitude

no problem i have run into this and i will not be undon we seat ourselv at the bar the bartend after 15 minut show up and hand us menus anoth 10 minut goe by and she ask us if we want anyth to drinkge ya think ok the rant on the servic end the food see the abov but just say blah

w both order the lunch special prime rib and pull pork sandwich call me stupid but if you call your lunch special special i actual expect you to put a littl someth into it the sandwich are about 10 a piec which i would not have balk at if not for the fact that my prime rib was noth more than roast beef sandwich meat and my trophi husband had littl to say for his pull pork the biggest issu i had was the enorm plate of fri that sat next to my briefli bast sandwich meat sandwich on some crummi groceri store hoagy

 i essenti paid 10 big one for a 5lb bag of oreida fri and a few handful of lunchmeat yes a huge portion but not my idea of a prime rib meal 

now on the wine front a veri nice select and for that alon they earn point but the pricesexact whi am i pay 900 for a glass of kendal jackson that i can find on the bottom shelf of safeway for an entir bottl at 11more to the point put someth on your wine list and charg me anyth you want as long as i cant find it at everi groceri store in a 5 mile radius i might live in chandler but i do leav the burb and i have seen the big light so if your staff want to act like they are somewher other than the middl of nowher then back the tude up with more than steam lunch meat and fri  denni been do it for year and they realli have the market on mediocr food so aspir for more500 movi for the kid  drop em off at harkin  pickup at 630  one errand to run im get a selfseal spare for my bike this time  sheesh alreadi with the flat and then we can have a nice dinner outalon  not time to go farwher to eat

what around here s gilbert  the 202  hmm  theyr all chain  were just not up for chain tonight  what around here that isnt a chain  smell of wood burning

what about that place red white and brew  ok  not a chain  winner

so we head over to rw  b  the servic was pretti good  i would say it almost extend into the park lot  we were about 20 feet from the door and someon was hold it for us welcom us to rw  b

after we order drink and perus the menu we settl on share an appet and split an entre  we share chicken empanada  they were littl fri pocket fill with spice chicken and a littleim not sure what els was in there  not bad lack a littl in complex  fresh and pipe hot we receiv these within minut of ordering

for the appet we share chicken marsala  the portion was pretti larg good for share  rw  bs chicken marsala was not as robust and flavor of a sauc as i was hope for  the chicken was tasti and tender but marsala is normal such a profound flavor sauc that i was a littl disappoint  it was serv with carrot spear and a choic of mash potato or rice pilaf  we order it with mash it came with pilaf  no problem  we tri the pilaf while we wait for the potato  the pilaf was nice flavor but troubl by occasion grain of uncook or driedout rice  the potato arriv and were veri standard and on the salti side  again portion was large

throughout our meal we were see basket of littl cheesi look roll arriv at nearbi tabl  we final ask what they were as we had not seen anyth like that on the menu  our waiter inform us that they were bread stick and that we had to ask for them  alright can we have some bread stick too pleas  rw b should consid the novel approach of offer up bread stick when you are seat likeeveri other restaur i have ever seen that serv bread sticks

it was then i rememb read christi ts review of rw b  at least it not a chainim give this place two star becaus the food isnt that bad albeit horribl overpr and obvious not grill to order  now if i were give star for the number of time i unintent saw my waitress ahemunmention this place would get eleventi one star  i know it a gimmick but i realli dont need or want to get a full view of my waitress crotch while eat  there a reason strip club have buffet  nobodi want nake peopl serv them food
speak of food the burger are eight buck  eight freakin buck  you realiz that that about how much a burger at delux is  of cours the side dont come with your eight dollar burger  theyr a la cart  so you want a burger fri coke and mayb a tip for your halfnak waitress 15 easi  save your money and go to chuck box   the burger are better and the employe actual wear clothwe like to support local own busi but some local establish make it so difficult for us to do so

mi wife and i went for lunch and order a sandwich lucca herb roast turkey and a bruschetta plate burnt mozzarella  pesto wild mushroom  caramel red onion  fig tapenad fyi there is no tabl servic so you have to order at the counter  

i will say that the staff was friend so that the posit though there should have been more staff work the counter becaus it got back up 

the sandwich tast ok but the present was unimagin the bread not fresh so dri it was fall apart and the portion smaller than similar price fare fare from other establish we frequent  frank the best thing on our sandwich plate was the potato chips

th bruschetta was laughabl for 699 we receiv 3 small slice of bread that were onli partial cover with a visual unappet mix of top the bread was not adequ toast so each piec was somewhat soggi in addit none of the top were warm even though the chees on two piec was melt and the third top with what we would describ as a chunki mushroom past that was claim as serv hot which led us to believ these item are prepar in advanc and not to order henc the cool temp and soggi bread

seri 699 for 3 small slice havent the owner ever been to postino to see what present flavor and valu are all about 

check the photo link in my profil and youll find the one i post of qcom sorri excus for a bruschetta plate 

and to all of you who will argu but the postino bruschetta is 1350 yes it near doubl the price but at postino you receiv a 4 larg piec of bruschetta cut into third for 12 slice total each slice about the size of one qcom bruschetta b easili tripl the amount of top on each piec c someth flavor that youll actual enjoy eat d a beauti present e tabl servic from friend knowledg staff

dont get me wrong i think it great that the rea famili has brought a fine rang of oliv oil and relat product to arizona and we have use their oil in our home kitchen

unfortun the del piero eateri is oper more like a tourist destin where they figur it a one shot opportun to get maximum return for minimum invest from custom who probabl wont be return 

our suggest take the tour buy some oliv oil then go somewher els for lunch where they have taken the care to give you superior ingredi prepar with skill in suffici quantiti to justifi the price and with friend effici servic to boot

oh yeah as for the gelato dont bother go to frost at san tan if you want a real authent phenomen gelato experience

thi comment for the owner while we were wait for our lunch we went over to the wine tast area the young ladi host the tast was veri pleasant and outgo but when we heard her say the pinot gris was made from white pinot noir grape we and the other coupl tast at the time realiz we wouldnt get an educ with our tast to qcom and all other establish do tast pleas pleas pleas dont have a wine novic do the pourafter three and a half year work with busi owner plan event tri to connect peopl to place worth prais ive learn a lot now this is not to say i know everyth there is to know about run a small busi id be run one if i did but i do know a coupl of thing and im about to reveal a million dollar secret that will take ani busi from bummer to bustl 

peopl first

hug right 

now what do i mean by this 

if you own a small busi you probabl do so for sever reason but your first should be peopl you should want to turn on the light unlock the door welcom member of the communiti into your space and exchang someth for the money patron are spend at your establish peopl are your busi it might not be the onli reason but it whi you exist

 been to the librari a few time now and each time im there i dont feel like im welcom i understand the place is tini it typic pack with drunk co it loud there littl room to maneuv all of this i understand but i also understand that it doesnt take much to make peopl feel like you valu their busi and you enjoy them experienc the thing that make you so stellar in a hospit way the staff that ive encount is anyth but hospit 

i tell busi owner strive for 5 in other word control everyth you can control and work to give peopl fivestar experi you cant be 100 100 of the time but a smile goe a long way a thank for stop in come back and see us again goe even farther im not certain what theyr strive for at the librari other than close time when they can turn the light off lock the door and not have to deal with peopl until tomorroweveri time i pass this place i tri one of these tea and go on my merri way but i alway leav say that was realli good  now im not a big tea fan  in fact i realli onli like herbal tea and i buy them from the supermarket and drink them when im sick  but citrus lavend sage had me hook and i had to buy my first tea from here  

i was disappoint by the salesperson who just kind of show me the two tea that are marri to make citrus lavend sage let me smell them but didnt realli answer my question or give me advic on how best to brew them  

i ask him if these would work well in my cuisinart singl cup machin with the reusabl filter  he said yes this will work fine  i then ask do i just brew the two tea in an equal amount to get this flavor  yes  i mean im not a specialti tea connoisseur and i could have use a littl more guidanc  

he then start scoop the two tea but not befor tri to upsel me with a reusabl canist to keep my tea fresh  i refus the canist and he went along his way  he told me that one scoop i guess 2 ounc was 10 dollar and i need two differ tea to make this flavor  so i took one scoop of each in hope to make 20 good cup of tea at home  he then overfil each bag by about 3 dollar i think this is some sort of ploy to increas sale becaus they ask you if that amount is ok and youll like say yes  i mean this isnt the deli where you get an extra slice of chees and your ok pay slight over a half a pound  when your cup of tea that suppos to cost 10 buck is 3 dollar over that pretti signific  but i figur i realli like this flavor and let just go with it 

anyway the tea are realli good but i think the servic and price could be a littl better now if anyon has ani tip on brew my new tea theyd be great appreci lolthis review is base on breakfast menu onli 

sinc i love the lunch and dinner soo much i thought i would go for sunday brunch 

first off they had a horribl select of breakfast they dont even serv french toast or omelet or breakfast sandwich 

they had a egg breakfast which is what i got consist of 2 egg with chees and bacon and tomato and avocado slice on the side 
first off i give it 1 star for appear it look wors that what i could have made at home 
the bacon was soggi the egg were look like neon yellow and clear a box egg which should not be the case with a place like herb box for 9 buck for box egg and soggi bacon 
i could have made it way better at home 

jami got the buckwheat pancak sinc they didnt have an option to have buttermilk the pancak were super super dri and almost gritti it said it came with strawberri im not kid you it was a half strawberri cut in 3 small piec it also had dri blueberri which were actual soo gross i could not believ they would not use the fresh one 

asid from that the onli other thing on the menu was 

custard donut and hot cocoa for 9 buck wtf a 9 dollar donut 

a bowl of oatmeal for 6 buck 

breakfast burrito which the guy next to us got and he took it back he said it was litter egg and dri black bean unseasoned

i saw the size and it was like 2 breakfast taquitos

ther where like 2 more thing but i cant think of it

if you want the breakfast herbox should have go to arcadia farmim not sure whi ive been to this restaur more than onc  my last experi is how i decid to give it a 2star mayb i would have given them a 3star base on prior visit at first i was tempt to give it a 1star but i reserv that rate for visibl creepi crawler etc

630  we arriv to make sure we are in time for happi hour 
645  our order was taken 
653  edamam and salad arriv no utensil napkin water or beer  the lower into the bowl of edamam we get the less fresh they tast 
655  napkin and utensil arriv  we ask about our beer and water it happi hour remember
658  water arriv happi hour is over so they take away the menu
702  beer arriv where are their priorities

then sushi arriv and it mediocr or even wors than mediocr  mayb i should say you get what you pay for

definit not go back herei love that there is a coffe bean  tea leaf in the palazzo and right near the suit elev for when you need it howev their price are so ridicul for example

cup of coffe 345
mocha frappuccino with 2 extra shot of espresso 970 no exaggeration

id rather play some money at the crap tabl and hope win too and order a free coffe i might even add some kahlua in it if im feel crazimy first trip was for lunch

 my waiter sold me on the lunch special fri shrimp and crab cake with pineappl salsa see pic 15 

but i love quich so i had to order that too see pic 10

 thank god i order both these were smaller than appet i was told that lunch had full size portion o well i guess at least it was realli good although i did have a problem with the shrimp it tast like cleaner they brought me a coupl more crabcak instead

 side note tabl have no salt pepper or sweeten i order an ice tea and still was not offer ani sugar



second trip brunch i had alreadi made reserv for brunch prior to my first visit

 so here we are again no salt and pepper or sweeten there was 3 of us and onli two tabl set up until right befor our food came out

 order ice tea and still had to ask for sweeteners

 what we ordered

 ham and biscuitsfresh bake biscuit virginia ham poach egg champagn hollandais see pic 12

the ham was not ham but extrem cheap and salti prosciutto i put it asid the rest was quit good although rather tini 
i inform the waiter  he come back with the chef apolog and some lame excus say well it american prosciutto that whi we call it ham wth the menu say virginia ham

 virginia ham mont cristoedward and son ham sourdough french toast swiss chees see pic 11
 veri good probabl the best thing between us all and it had the ham that it described

 sunni side up eggsorgan egg smoke bacon hash brown see pic 9
this was not on the kid menu by the way and veri sad it was serv with denni hashbrown this is a fancier restaur shouldnt those be taboo

 buttermilk pancakeshousemad butter fig and peach syrup see pic 10

they tast good but that doe not make up for the fact that they were serv with no butter and cold syrup and a littl burnt as you can see


let me sum it all up for you

have to go somewher els for breakfast after brunchpriceless

 i realli have mix feel about this place becaus the food is quit good but realli overpr for the portion size i mean i do go to a restaur to eat for god sake

it might be cheaper to invest in a lap band surgeri than to tri and go here and get full

i have to go with 25 stari first read about this place in the phoenix new time and i take my wife there on occas we like come here for dessert after eat somewher els their take on banana cream pie is exquisit but it seem with everi time we give this eateri our patronag the servic get wors and worse

cork version of banana cream pie is awesom eleg and tasti but have a meal here is a differ stori and after onli tri the food one time i wont ever do it again 

the one time my wife and i order food from cork it was onli out of curios and was follow meal at anoth place thus we onli want someth light befor order the banana cream pie so we each got an appet i got the plate of meat chees and cracker and she got a salad both dish were lean on the help and though ive come to just expect it from cork i find the portion a bit annoy for what you pay ive seen what other patron order as well and see the cost on the menu geez anyway my appet was good for what it was and the wife was satisfi with her as far as tast went but the turnoff was with the waiter through the entir time first he act veri irrit when we onli order water and not wine and was veri condescend with us want onli appet to preced our pie usual peopl order a meal with an appet wtf the kicker was when he made snarki comment about me pay cash instead of use my card what dude when i have 35 in my pocket is the place realli too ritzi to pay the check with cash that was a new one

if my review were base sole on what our person cork stapl is the banana cream pie then itd get 5 star but between the minimalist yet expens portion and the upnos elitist attitud of our waiter i just cant give it even an averag rate from now on we onli come to cork for dessert seem like the wait staff wont turn into diva when you do that

peculiarlocat in fulton ranch a fair new upscal shop center includ an aj saute seem to be tri too hard and in some case not hard enough

i stop in for an impromptu lunch even though i was still slight full from breakfast
oh i hate it when i go somewher new and everyth sound good and i dont know what to order so i thought id tri a few differ things

pretti expens entre up to 2995 moder price salad and sandwich around the 10 range

i decid to start with the fri calamari soak in buttermilk for maximum tender these thick and juici strip were melt in your mouth blissse pic 
the accompani sauc howev were not a good match chipotl chile tast like spici bbq and the key lime red pepper was like a sweeten thin out mayo i didnt detect ani lime flavor in there at all i end up ask for lemon wedg which were just what those babi need yum

i also order the chicken satay skewer serv with spici tangerin sauc these were tasti and the sauc was perfect matchse pics

th last thing i tri was one of their fire grill flatbread i chose the of the day flavor which was urban chicken with spinach mushroom and smoke gouda see pic 
not impress at all i can guarante this was not made to order my top slid around under a thick blanket of dri chees mean it was melt sometim befor i ever order it i onli took two bites

mi waiter servic was good i was visit in total by 3 differ waiter all who ask how everyth was and i express to each of them my dislik of the pizza 

unfortun none of them offer to get me someth els or remov it from my billwhich is the courteous standard at most restaurantsespeci new ones

th pizza was even box  up for me whi would i want to take home someth i didnt like i told him to toss it

im not sure if i would come back here or not mayb to tri a salad but im not go to chanc spend 30 on entre that i might not likei have realli been crave greek food and i was in the area so i thought id give this new place a try

i decid on get their varieti platter which consist of hummus baba ganoush dolmad spanakopita and falafel serv with pita breadse pics

oh how disappointing

strik 1
the baba ganoush was over pure into a thin slimi goo it didnt tast veri good either all the baba ganoush i have ever eaten has been thick and had some textur left to it with a veri distinct flavor this was the worst ive ever had

strik 2
the hummus was gritti and bland i was realli look forward to the strong garlicki lemon tast none of that here though again anoth worst ever

strik 3
the dolmadesgrap leav smother in a thick tomato and lemon slime had the mushiest yet sticki and pasti rice insid it was awful
i grew up on these and actual make them quit oftengrandma secret recip so i think i know what im talk about  ive had bad grape leav but these take the cake

your out
th falafel well you can see from the pictur they look more like cooki but nowher near as good they were more like fri wet sand  dri with no flavor at all i wouldnt feed these to my dog

th spanakopita might have been the most edibl part of this platter but by then it was too late they had alreadi been way past strike out in my book

i tell the waitress and she send over the manag to whom i explain whi i was unhappi with my meal
sh apolog but the has the nerv to ask me
wel are you greek

a a matter of fact yes i am i should be ask her that

i know good greek when i eat it and especi when i make it myself with recip taught to me by own grandmoth and sorri honey but that wasnt it

i gave 2 star onli becaus she took it off my bill opathe server walk around like lost puppies

i dont understand the need for sexual explicit name for item on the menus or the attir the decor of this restaur is so upscal but the uniform of the staff is like a beer barn or something

th sushi was okay ive had better

w wont be backit hard to find a great bagel in the desert  but mayb that appropri for a spars water climat sinc one step in the bagelmak process is soak the dough in boil water  so us desertdwel are left with a varieti of corpor chain bakeri serv up bagel that are    well good enough 

onc you accept that you cant alway get what you want brooklyn bagel is    well good enough  they offer a wellstock select of bagel plain everyth asiago chocol chip etc and a wideselect of cream chees flavor plain fat free honey jalapeno etc  it hard to insult a wellstock place

but brooklyn bagel onli get two star becaus it is so overpr  a simpl bagel and cream chees cost 3  serious  3 buck  and at the risk of becom the old grumpi man of yelp talk about how much it cost way back when 3 is at least 1 too much for a bagel and cream chees  serious it a simpl noncompl bake treat 204 at dunkin donut  

but if your look for a quick over the counter breakfast place you could definit find wors  they also offer a varieti of egg dish breakfast wrap sandwich and pancak  that a nice touchrevolv sushi bar and fine japanes dine that what the sign says

cool littl color code plate of sushi ride around on a move belt befor your eye small portion make it easi to keep grab plate then they add up the color at the end and bring your check

whit 125
yellow 175
green 225
brown 275
black 325

there is everyth from egg to shrimp and tuna etc in 2 piec and all kind of roll in 4 piec even littl dessert go by also a small menu with tempura teriyaki salad etc

dont see what you want just ask and they will make it appear

i had a crunch roll and tuna avocado roll and an order of tuna see pic  drink and a tip was onli 10

was the sushi good  it was ok for 2 i cant complain i like the crunch roll the tuna wasnt cut proper with the grain so you couldnt easili bite a piec off

i dont know that they should be call themselv  fine dine it about as fine as mcdonald if you know what i mean

dont go here here for qualiti sushi or atmospher go becaus you want sushi and onli have 5 buck to your name

25 starwhat a major disappoint  i alway thought the old simon at the hard rock was kind of unimpress so i was convinc that the new simon would definit be an improv  wrong

they realli miss the mark on this one  the space is beauti i will give them that  a veri chic and clean ambianc while you dine poolsid and check out the view of the palm fantasi tower

th posit pretti much end there  the fact of the matter is that their food suck  period  we order the crispi creami rock shrimp the garganelli pasta with lobster clam and pea and the chicken curri  the rock shrimp were mediocr  not bad but not good  somewhat soggi  our entre howev both suck hardcor  my pasta had a somewhat sweet flavor and i felt like the lobster use was stingi in addit to be overcook  and the pasta was not al dent at allit was actual fall apart  my friend entre was straight up bad  the curri was way to thin and liquidi and the chicken was dri and overcook  we end up send that dish back and the friend busser told us that most custom dont like that dish in particular in addit to my pasta as well  she was surpris i didnt send the garganelli back too id also like to mention that the bread bowl that i had been look forward to all day was disappoint as well  the old simon had much better fresher bread variet  the pretzel bread was dri and stale and all the other bread were eh and cold

in addit to the mediocr food both me and my friend thought the attract femal bartend was rude and bitchi  and dont be fool my friend the pineappl mojito made with fresh pineappl is not actual made with fresh pineappl but can pineappl juic  bleh  i will mention that our server was extrem friend and put up with my high mainten bullshit veri well  prop to him

go back to what you were do befor kerri simon  caus this definit aint an improv  will not be back unless there are some mayjah chang with the menuso ive been here a half dozen time now not by choic mind you and the 2 star rate still hold 

an exampl of how rude their server are 
i order a sushi platter describ on the menu as california roll and tuna hand roll i despis spici tuna i hate spici thing and hate mayo so imagin my surpris when a spici tuna handrol show up i explain to the waiter the menu say just tuna so id like a tuna handrol he refus say im wrong the menu say spici and walk away i have to freak go grab a menu  show him the word tuna hand roll  and ask again for a new handrol befor he goe and grab me anoth one ugh

besid the servic the food is just blah bland expens im into the whole foofoo lunch thing but honest societi cafe at encor doe the whole concept far better the surf and turf taco for 17 are tini i got a filet mignon cobb salad today for 18 i order my steak medium rare the salad is so sad look and imagin my disappoint to find my filet mignon is 2 ounc or so of grizzli tough dark brown steak hard a filet mignon definit not medium rare and for sure 2 ounc of steak over green for 18 is a ripoff the sushi is a step abov groceri store sushi  yup that the best i can say for it 

rant over  space is still beauti but servic  food continu to go downhili dont have mani regret in life but eat brunch at simon is one of them it was quit possibl one of the biggest wast of money ive ever spent at a restaur mediocr food along with mediocr servic made for a poor dine experi at a place know for brunch it a combin of buffet style where you get your own food at a buffet line and butler style where you place an order with your server and they bring the order to you

th easter brunch i went to consist of averag panini sushi that was the equival of that found at the local groceri store bruschetta crepe pastri and cereal

of the higherend item serv butler style the french toast with it crispi exterior was the best less than stellar item includ the lobster havarti benedict that was sore lack ani lobster i saw a coupl spec of crustacean between the bread base of the benedict continu the disappoint were the dri rib and even dryer jalapeno cornbread the kid pancak was dens and had an almost rubberi textur ham and roast beef was also avail and as good as ani youd find at a 899 buffet downtown dessert were lacklust and even someon like me who crave sweet couldnt stomach more than a coupl bite 

for the price we paid for a famili of three i couldnt help but think about all the other place  buffet or a la cart  that would have been much more satisfimaizi cafe  bistro
mi girlfriend had just finish audit for the phoenix choir so i want to treat her to a meal we like to tri new thing and especi local venu and sinc we go to lux occasion had notic a few new spot just north of there one of them is maizi cafe  bistro

i should have gotten a sens that someth was strang with this place when i call to make sure they were open the woman on the other end seem taken aback by this simpl question i then ask if they were ani good and onc again there was a hesitation

w arriv at around 645 to a fair pack restaur which is alway a good sign especi on a monday night right howev i was immedi surpris to see three big screen televis on each wall save the back one presum becaus this had a wine rack on it i dont know about you but when a room that is at best 20 x 20 has three 42 inch tvs in it i call that a sport bar and they had american footbal on one and what the rest of the world call footbal on the other to offset this they did have the third tv set to the food network

our tabl was somewhat sticki and when our drink arriv the coaster for the tea got stuck to the tabl and eventu peel away troubl but i want to keep posit sinc this was a celebr we order wine and a chees plate and almost immedi were approach by anoth waitress wonder if we were readi to order veri confusing

th chees plate was straight out of home econom they could have gone to safeway and put a better select of chees togeth i would go easier on them except that the ambienc and price are ask for the qualiti to be better than presented

mi girlfriend order the tuna salad and i got the fresh basil pasta with marinara now i know that one of the hip thing to do is have eclect dinnerwar to set your restaur apart from the rest but serv salad in mix bowl that dont match the decor is veri awkward throw a few veggi in said bowl and then a heap scoop of tuna mix is not an entre it a lunch item same goe with the marinara dish this cacophoni of salad item saute up and mix with pasta and a decent marinara sauc is onc again lunch fare not a 12 dinner entree

throughout the cours of this dinner we had both waitress come up to us about everi 5 minut to make sure everyth was okay a littl hint to good serv if someon is in the middl of a sentenc dont ask if everyth is okay this becam veri annoy and when i mention it to my parti we were approach onc again as if they were tri to push the point

anoth featur of maiz is that it has free wifi and post this fact on it doorway so we are also tri to be a coffe shopinternet cafe so to add to the glow of plasma screen all around a group of student sit next to our tabl and launch up three laptop veri romant indeed

th piec de resist thought was when the floresc light from the outsid awn kick in halfway through the entre and we were bath in a brilliant glow of bland at this point we both broke down into laughter at the whole spectacl the effect was a perfect way to end this experience

overal maiz is a horribl confus concept with incred schitzophren tendenc it want to be everyth to everyon the look say it want to be a wine bar but the tvs confus that aspect the menu talk gourmet but the realiti is that they are serv lunch fare which has it place the free wifi mean you will be get non diner which will onli make the diner more uncomfort i get a sens of what they are tri to do which is a cafebistro but in order to do that you need to scale down the ultra modern look of the place from the outsid it say dinner but the realiti is that it a hangout

to it credit it was close to full on a monday even so there seem to be some appealone word can sum up my experi at maizi unremark 

the restaur is a cute place and i realli want to like it 

the servic was slow our server would disappear for long period of time leav us with empti glass and we watch as other tabl got their food even though we had order befor them i am not sure what is so difficult about make a sandwich but clear there was some rocket scienc type stuff go on back there that caus a 25 minut wait for the food

i had the veggi burger with fri and my sister had a salad with ancho orang dress and a cup of potato soup 

i didnt tri the salad but the dress was describ to me as tint mayonnais with no flavor the thick and chunki potato soup got a better respons it was actual realli good 

about the veggi burgerkudo to maizi for make them inhous but for cri out loud could you give them some flavor pleas i now understand whi the burger is serv with apricot tzatziki and red onion marmalad without them the burger is tasteless ah well the fri were good 

one more nit picki thing that drive me crazi about this place spell error on the menu serious there isnt a comput today that doesnt come with some form of spell check use it 

i doubt i will be back to maizi noth about the visit thrill mesad  this isn t as good the second time as the first time the first time i was here the food seem fresh and light and i realli enjoy a volcano sushi tartar  dish  mmmm  but this time what happen   

the servic was okay although for as empti as the place was  it seem a  bit slow for refil and check in 

akward sushi servic  we were sit at the bar and sudden get  all our sushi at onc on all differ plate  ahhh  where do we put them  and no one has clear our appet plate 

the roll were big but sad unmemor someth fri  someth spici tuna ish blah blahdi  blah  you get the pictur 
the good ole boy sit next us were kind of fun to watch they were sing countri song while watch footbal  cram too big of piec of sushi in their mouths

it not good when the slant bathroom are the most memor part of your restaur  doubt i ll be backsometh about this place alway told me to stay far far away but by all right all of us should tri everi italian restaur around becaus someon somewher must be nail italian restaur the tripleaxel of the culinari busi i just havent found them yet

i should have listen to my impuls to stay away but my wife has been want to tri this place for year for some reason we thought we would forgo some risk by use the to go servic and order onlin nay the problem this place has pervad all it crevic all the way out to the park lot

i order some junk onlin a small caesar salad a small quattro al forno and a small eggplant parmesan it would be readi from 500515pm i got there at about 450 and a friend ladi came out right away and gave me the bill to sign she said my food was not quit done fine cool whatev i was earli i could wait a few

a half hour later it would dawn on me that not quit done in restaur parlanc actual mean we havent start cook your food after i watch numer peopl park at the to go window and leav with their food the harri ladi final came back out with my stuff explain that they had to cut more eggplant ah the mysteri they and their lack of kitchen manag skill an order for eggplant come in onlin at 430 whi cut up ani eggplant silly

i got home and discov that the rest of my order had appar been sit around while the eggplant dish was prepar the eggplant was moder hot  howev the quattro al forno was room temperatur and so was the salad the eggplant was way too thin and not season well and featur chunk of uneven parmesan that had clear been cut instead of grate the quattro al forno might have been good when it was design to be serv but it temperatur made me quesy

when all was said and done i realiz that id consum passabl italian food at quit a premium price with poor servic to go with it i felt full of lukewarm food and disappoint which is realli a strang sensat im sure this place has it moment when it hit on all cylind but it aint sunday at 5pmwe want to find a restaur within lake of las vega sinc that is where our cousin are stay with a 2 month old  after give up on find a 4 star place to eat within the area earl made an execut decis to tri out sonrisa  

when we arriv on a friday at 630ish pm there were not mani peopl at lake of las vega  it was veri dead  when we got to the restaur there were not mani guest there either  

the food was mediocr at best  i got the avocado roll earl got thei dont even rememb  it was so unmemorable
  
earl ask the waitress if they make good michelada  she said yes with confid  when she brought out the michelada the color was off  it was no bueno

summari  we wont be come backi made a reserv for 630pm and we arriv just befor that we were told that our tabl was not readi yet but it would onli be 3 minut befor we were seat becaus we were next we went to the bar to have a glass of wine as we wait  dure this time the hostess sat 2 other parti of 4 in front of us each time i ask about our tabl and she would say oh yes you are next but your tabl isnt readi 

final at 720pm we were seat at our tabl we were told by the hostess the delay was becaus of the lobster special i find that strang becaus the coupl at tabl next to us said that you had to order the lobster in advanc with your reserv so i doubt that was the actual caus 

mi wife order the famous steak i get concern ani time a restaur butterfli a filet but it sound good my wife ask that it be prepar medium rare and was veri specif becaus after the steak is cook it is cover in mash potato and bake again unfortun the steak came out medium well we sent it back and did get anoth one cook proper howev by the time the replac steak came out we were almost done eat 

i order the meatloaf base on our server recommend i thought it was just averag and realli did not care for the crispi aka burnt edg the other coupl we were with order the east meet west surpris small portion and the burger there was no ketchup on the plate with the burger and by the time some arriv at the tabl the burger had gotten cold 

drink from the bar were slow as well it took over 10 minut for a vodka on the rock to arriv 

our server was fantast and we did feel bad make our concern known becaus we knew that she would be held respons even though the wait and over cook food was not her fault 

eddi wife stop by the tabl and we polit told her about our dine experi  we were not look for ani type of handout we just want her to know what was go on in her restaur  she was veri nice and sent over a round of dessert and invit us to call her befor our next trip back 

overal the food did not live up to what we were expect mayb we caught them on a bad night we might go back to tri it again but not if we would have to wait 40 minut after our reserv time for a tabli live down the block from here and order a pizza from there onc the owner deliv it himself and we chat for a few minut 

the pizza  ive had better the crust was kind of under cook and there wasnt much chees on it i know this sound silli but the larg was both not great and too small  what i mean is that the qualiti and size  should have both been better im from ny so i know what a pizza is suppos to be like pizza a metro fuhgeddaboutit

im lay off those kind of carb for now so i wont be tri the other dish ani time soonpoor execut no coordin in the kitchen less than savori ingredients


what is it about phoenician and ani pizza not serv by domino or pizza hut they go gaga for it they 5star it they vote it number one in the nation and it make zagat clear throat then spit

i was excit about this place given all the extrem high review and yelp hype they even have their yelp window sticker i arriv without a reserv and my guest and i were seat right away servic was prompt and the food runnerbus while veri timid was on the ball refil our drinks

th thincrust pizza dough cut into small piec for the bread tray was serv hot and crispi from the oven but there was no inspir no flavor the sweet oliv salad that accompani it was the same sweeten by someth but noth more the kitchen need someon to light the spark get them to think befor they just drop the plate for pickup

th capres salad was beauti but arriv with no pepper no salt and no oliv oil it was there on the tabl but realli im of the camp that the sp shaker are there for decor onli the kitchen is suppos to season my order correct if the kitchen isnt go to do it at least offer fresh ground pepper at the tabl by the server is this a doityourself menu

i order the grill calamari salad becaus im tire of breadedandfri unfortun the onli tast i got from the salad were the flavor from the grill left over from other meat that was recent prepar there i hope recent mean just that day no earlier no dress no tossedwithanyth befor plate zip salad mix was straight from the dole premix bag

th main cours from the kitchen arriv all at onc but we were told the veggi pizza was still on it way seven minut later it arriv and be polit diner the rest of us had wait you guess it our were cold lasagna was overcook and mushi uninterest with the gob of pizza sauc pile on it i could have done better at the readywrap from fresh and easi cream sauc from the artichok dish was so rich and thick it could be call chees yuck the artichok themselv hadnt been peel and the outer chewi leaf was still on the veggi pizza crust was the same bland bread we had just sampl it veggi too thick cut to cook proper so they were partial raw with cool centers

w were offer a tiramisu as dessert and it was sumptuous

i hope that i get to updat this review with a better result next time but for now what these cook need is a good kick in the pants

get your act togethbeen to raku at least 2530 time sinc they open be a part of the industri crowd it was awesom to have a late night place with the kinda food i like this town is cri for better food without have to go to the strip or some shitti chain restaur i think that restaur have spent year take advantag of the fact that a lotta peep still have the buffet mental most bang for the buck even if it frozen reheat then slather in mayonnais 

the qualiti of the food present set etc is except and should be the standard for restaur expect peopl are trip when they say raku is overpr if you are that cheap and dont understand good food then stick to all you can eat sushi or the 10 buffet 

compar to ani japanes restaur in the countri for the price they charg the food is phenomen star 

howev the issu i have is my last 2 visit i saw a big chang in their servic staff from last year not sure what happen the old ladi btw is a fuck rude bitch yes i come from an asian background in culinari as well and what the hell is your problem after we spend 300  400 everi time we go there 

last coupl of time they were out of numer menu item understand they prep x amount per day but not onc did they say that item were not avail until we tri to order it was annoy to the point that i final ask the waitress to just tell me what they did not have she next proceed to repeat what i had alreadi order but was not avail thank this happen sever time get drink order and refil was a major pain in the ass the first round of food we order all cold app took near 50 minut in addit some item we order the waitress came back 30 minut later to tell us they were sold out tabl wasnt even buss then somewher near the 3rd round of food they came and pull plate that we were still work on 

all in all the servic dure my last 2 visit was almost nonexist mayb it was the fact that on one of those visit the owner had a big parti of friend on one tabl and that was their primari focus of the night who know ive seen lot of peopl be comp item and that doesnt bother me the onli thing i would expect is to have someon at least come to check on our drink bus the tabl without have to wait 25 minut and at least keep us inform when food is go to take an hour i love the food there and i would still recommend it to anyon but the servic has plain gone to shitfinal made it here for dinner servic  made a reserv for 4 at 8pm and was seat immedi at 750pm when we got there  the hostess ask if we care for outdoor din which is not my normal option but i felt like tri someth differ  so we end up in the great outdoor on the patio

th outdoor patio is nice with a roar fire overhead heater and plenti of seat  it is onli open on one side which face a back alley  not realli a star gaze set and everi so often you are a few feet away from a speed car use the alley  i think i will eat insid next time wish the patio had more view but not much to look at here  i can also note that be outsid at least in our case reduc attent by the staff  i almost felt forgotten at time as my soda sat empti wait for a refil  i would have to speak up if i want a refil  i would not of notic but we did not receiv dinner till 830pm  so be prepar for a 30 minut wait for dinner  

i decid to go with the one of the dinner special which was the pork tenderloin  the polenta had an excel tast but was on the dri side  almost like it sat for awhil  like a film on top of it had form on it  the balsam reduct was good and almost save the dish  with the balsam reduct the pork tenderloin was edibl  i use the balsam reduct t add moistur to the pork  the pork was so over cook that i could not eat the dri meat without dip it into the sauc  i could not even finish 1 tenderloin on my plate  

i usual do not send dish back and i was tri to eat it without complaint  luckili aura c wave down a waitress and they took it away  they did inform me that i could have someth els but at the cost of anoth 30 minut of our time  i think i lost my appetit at that point

anoth dinner guest of our note lipstick stain on her water glass  she end up drink a soda and let her water glass sit  so after a long hour for dinner i note our waitress came to our tabl a total of 4 time that includ take the order take my dish away ask if we care for desert and take the bill  of the 4 time we had to wave her down to note the pork was dri  

i can recommend lunch servic i have had great servic then and good food  i cannot recommend dinner servic howev  with such inconsist servic food and staff i am sure i would not bring my out of town friend here to enjoy food and the citi  i can say it is a great lunch stop but dinner still seem to need some work  i am still tri to put this restaur on a must eat list sinc it is onli minut from my hous  look like i need to travel still to get good servic and foodfrom the minut you step in the door it pretti obvious that this is a chain the nice thing about pub in ireland live over in the uk until i was 21 so ive been to a pub or seven is that they may be own by one or two breweri but they each have their own feel menu and clientel also ive never seen a pub in ireland with the server wear scottish kilt come to think of it ive never seen one with the server wear irish kilt either the place lack the craic not a drug the other kindfun enjoy abandon or lightheart mischief often in the context of drink or music 

what i realli want to know is what the heck nacho were do on the menu in a socal irish pub just becaus potato wedg were substitut for tortilla chip doesnt mean the dish is now irish oh and what was up with the chees whizz crap they put on top of them on the bright side the boxti wasnt badbas stew beef cook with guin in a potato pancak 

suggest  a live irish band might make all the differ to darci mcgee but im not in charg of market in the mean time if you want a place with a somewhat more tradit irish pub atmospher go to rula bula on mill avenudarci mcgee remind me of casey moor lameass cousin who shop at walmart invit client to dinner parti and talk about work everi second your with him  it just so corpor  everyth that could be potenti perceiv as be a pub or irish or fun is whitewash with wholesom temp marketplac diarrhea

mi main complaint is that it seem like a bar that my aunt and uncl would love  theyd think the décor was realli cute and theyd then becom regulars

i feel a littl bad for the girl that work there  they wear these plaid miniskirt and these high sock and it just the ideal imag for a pervi fatass businessman to drool all over  

that be said this place isnt all bad  the one advantag it has is that it pretti damn close to the movi theater  so conveni enough for me i can slip in grab a coupl beer and a coupl cocktail and watch someth good and buzzed

oh and one time i smoke a cigarett outsid and i saw someon hock a loogi onto a cop car  i laughed

two star for the loogi and for the conveni locatso this was my first time eat at red robin ever yes i said ever i was realli excit to see that they had a mushroom burger on their menu not a lot of place have mushroom burger so i was super excit to tri it when our food came out my burger was cook to my specif but the tast of the burger and the mushroom was veri dull i felt like there was no flavor or pizazz to the burger with all the mushroom onion and chees i figur this burger would be make my tast bud jump around instead it did the complet opposit i ate a few bite and decid to just visit with my friend and munch on my fri my fri were cold and kind of mushi when i eat french fri i like them crispi and warm a lot of my friend love this place so i will give it anoth tri just not a veri good first impress mayb if i order someth els i will have better luck i usual tri to give new place more than one shot just on that occasion off day we all have everi now and then came for lunch with elnino f and angela h im down for healthi eat so ive been curious to give this spot a tri 

i order the chicken hummus wrappini 999 with the vegan chicken i was curious and regular mozzarella chees it also had lettuc and tomato in a chipotl tortilla the chicken and hummus part was decent howev there was a huge amount of lettuc in there in comparison to chicken hummus or chees and for 10 i was hope i could get at least a even spread of top and not get a bunch of cheap filler iceburg lettuc at least pour on the hummus for some nice flavor in it but it was spars and not even spread after i ate the spot with the hummus it was bland and dryit was frustrat to get a bite of promis of someth good and then bite into bleak nothing it come with a side and i chose salad what i found odd was that my lettuc didnt look dress so i move it around and saw a few leav were but not enough to say it was dress it like they dress one salad for someon had a few left and pour it onto my plate and then forgot to dress up anoth batch and just threw it on my plate i got vinaigrett after ask but spars dress spars hummus is this suppos to make it uber healthi to not add so much sauc or are they just sauc nazi give me flavor no flavor is unhealthi to my state of be 

i trade a half wrap with elnino and sinc his buffalo wrap came with a side sauc it was better sinc i can pour on some flavor 

i heard though dessert were shine i know red velvet is the namesak but sinc elnino got that i decid to get a comfort favorit of mine chocol chip banana bread pud 650 i was realli curious how this was gonna be moist and tasti without the milk aspect of most pud at first it kinda tast like it had some rum in it which was odd but it was doabl then i got to a banana chunk and stop eat the rummi flavor was made becaus the banana had gone bad and ferment my cake 

elnino warm red velvet was surpris good and the servic was fair nice and kept with the ice tea but i left disappoint i had a bit of a hope a good spot for veggi exist and after think about it this weekend and think of all the glow thing peopl have said to me im rather upset to have paid 24 for that that can get 2 delici vegan entre at my favorit thai spot around town 

im far from be a vegetarian but i know good flavor food and this didnt make me want more im from la and i love the vegetarian fare at a lot of the vegan spot about town i love it that i was a regular at real food daili becaus it was creativ and tasti i was hope and wish that rvc  be my no brainer healthi meal spot but not even sure i want to go back ever

i cant give it more than a 2 when tast and valu isnt present and make me wonder how long they let pastri sit around if banana were allow to go rank 

mayb if your vegan and dont have much food choic then this place would be okay to go to but i think your better off go to a vegan friend asian place or get sandwich from whole foodmy friend alway tri to hype up this place to me and im put a stop to that now i final visit this place yesterday and was sad disappointed

b the hip veganvegatarian cafe that it was it was pricey but the food was mediocr in fact it the same shit you can go a coupl block over and buy at whole food 
me and my friend order two differ thing she got chicken burger with fri and i got a panini sandwich witth tomato we both opt for the vegan option 
when we got our order which took forev we were brought pretti much the exact same thing except differ bread the chees was your standard outofthepackag daiya vegan chees they didnt tri to even melt it down and mix it with some sort of flavor to boost the choic coincid with the menu we had the exact same chicken patti again same thing i make my lunch with to take to work
what the ice on the cake though was my friend hamburg bun it look like that shit you buy at walmart with it yellow poppi seed and it larg cooki cutter shape round it wasnt vegan i ask the guy at the front what it was and he said it was whitewheat bread like we were stupid enough to believ that becaus it definit wasnt

thi place just pretti much doe your groceri shop for you then charg you tripl the price noth is organ and truli made for you it all frozen shit from the supermarket that they pop in the microwav 
i wish vega would get a real veganvegetarian cafe caus this place is patheti am conflict on how to rate honey pig i like the qualiti of the meat and the fact that they basic cook everyth for you what i am not a huge fan of is how understaf they are the upcharg on item without notic the lack of kalbi dure lunch and the limit of it on dinner 

we roll in as a larg parti of 10 and sat in the back it took some time for the ladi to get to us and start the grill half our parti was eat while the rest of us were wait to start when we began we were happi with the food for the most part the meat could have use some season if the sesam oil dip sauc was not to come with salt the marin meat just tast too sweet

onc we got start the attend start to loosen up we didnt eat that much and ask for the bill halfway through it threw her off and she kept offer to bring out more food if we need overal she was rather nice but we all had to get to work or do errand honey pig was decent but i have other place i would go first if the need for korean bbq hitit been at least 5 or 6 year sinc the last time i visit this joint  i work at the eldorado casino back in the mid 90s and this place use to have decent foodthat was back when it was name cactus joe  it realli gone downhil sinc those days

i happen to be in the area and stop by for lunch with my mom  i order the nacho wo meat and mom order the fish  chip special

aft a short wait we were serv our food  i was disappoint to see that the nacho were chip chees whiz tomato onion on a plate with a small bowl of bean cup of guacamol cup of salsa and two packag of sour cream on the sidewhat the   was i suppos to creat this thing myself  where did it say that on the menu  i know whi they did itto save money  there less food wast when you do stuff like that but seriously

a a fan of nacho it was a huge letdownplus they didnt tast good at all  the chip werent fresh and the flavor were just strangeunappealing

mom enjoy her fish  chip which were realli fish  fri  she like her fish and i tri a few friesthey werent bad  mayb i order the wrong item

overal the servic was good and sinc mom enjoy her dish im give this place 2 star instead of 1

will i return  someday i probabl will for the sake of nostalgiabut i predict it wont happen ani time soon820
this groceryslasheateri remind me more of cafe istanbul in term of it lighter traffic than that of hajibaba eateri and market  some of the item on the shelv had a light blanket of dust
ord the beef kabob 2 pcs platter with lettuc onion hummus and two pita  the kabob were tasti even though they were slight overdon in temperatur  like the pita dislik the hummus  i couldnt tast ani flavor from the chickpea tahini or spice  just that of an oil i couldnt even place it origin  as i was finish up the kabob and pita i spi two young men enjoy their beef shawarma so i order one togo  got into my car and couldnt wait to have a bite  i shouldv gone with my first choic of beef shawarma this was a veri tasti select  id come back to order it again

i also enjoy a lebanes bake dessert almost cakelik with two distinct layer slight sweet chees reminisc of driedout ricotta and cream chees on the bottom and goldenorang wheat semolina top with crush pistachio  a side sauc dish of simpl syrup accompani the dessert  i had ask the woman behind the counter two time what the dish was call and she didnt sound too confid in tell me that she knew it as shmeer  it the closest thing i could deciph  perhap shmeed might be a better word can anyon help me  the ff is the closest imag i found to what i think i had  if so then my dessert was miss the ashtar top a type of clot cream pictur below  the dessert i bought doesnt even come close to approach the wow factor of this link imag kanefeknefeh

httpgrabyourforkblogspotcom200708rabeihsweetspunchbowlhtmlthe food absolut amazing

a a vegetarian i am alway look for new place to eat i work near chakra and a cowork and i decid to head over there on our hour lunch break we walk in and saw a sign that said pleas wait to be greet so we did for almost ten minut a few employe glanc at us and didnt say anyth final an employe told us we could sit anywher we want  whi did we need to wait to be greet then oh well 

the food isnt cheap a tea and the nutti rawvacado ran me near 20 buck with tip our server was all right but it took ten minut just to get her over to get our drink order anoth 2530 minut pass we were look at around 145 and we had to be back to work by 2pm and our food was final out

and it was realli good the plate was overflow with green and my sandwich was delici we stuf our face pretti quick  i didnt get to enjoy my food half as much as i wouldv like my cowork mention that last time he had eaten at chakra he had end up have a near 2hour lunch becaus of the slow servic 

i hate to say it but for almost all raw food what the heck is take so long in the kitchen

a delici as the food was i have to say  i probabl wont be back to chakrathis time around i decid against the bbq and order 2 deep fri pbj  honey sandwiches

i like the atmospher with the bar beer pong and all the tvs to watch the game the hostess and server are veri friend but the food is just

th pbj was way too heavili batter and veri greasi i expect it to be cut in half and mayb a littl powder suger for 450 each

it look veri undesir and it was so greasi i bare made it through half

adam has been veri disappoint both visitsthey seem to be be focus too much on the bar  beer pong shit to cater to the colleg kid they have lost track of good bbq  food in general veri lacklust and they even threw in a free order of watermelon slice which did noth to impress me

i was veri upset that this wasnt better than a twinki i will have to tri my own at home to get it righti pick up take out from chef chiang yesterday  695 for the hunan chicken lunch special  it come with the entre white or fri rice egg drop or hot  sour soup one crab rangoon one fri wonton fill with some indistinguish meat and one thin fri thing fill with cream chees and possibl someth els but i couldnt realli tast anyth besid cream cheese

th crab rangoon had no discern crab flavor  if i had sent it off to a lab they may have found some i suppos  the entre was soupi  veri soupi  the sauc was oknoth special  it was a littl spici  the veggi assort in the chicken dish was pretti minim and the onli thing that tast fresh was a littl bok choy

i dont care for egg drop or hot  sour soup so i wont comment on that  i didnt eat the egg roll  it look overdon  greasy

i probabl wont go to chef chiang again  mediocr at bestokay this review is base onli on the order process as i didnt get to tast the pie i order a pie about 10 day ago and was so excit as they had the type i want the peopl were veri nice who took my order and veri accommod henc the two star i order crumb top and was so excit 
we obvious didnt order anyth els now for the birthday celebr with a bunch of peopl as they had what the birthday guy want then the day befor the celebr when i was to go pick up the pie they call and say the kitchen made a mistak and made it with the wrong top now what do i do last minut they didnt offer ani compens and did they realli expect me to take cream toplet me get just one thing straight

i am will to shell out for someth good for someth pretti delici when i heard about the 360 price tag for a 13 cours meal yeah that right bitch 13 cours  not 16 like i was expect  and yeah  that pricetag is without wine ill admit that i balk i was hesit but hey if it make my tastebud sing  im all will to give it a try

let me tell you the context  my bf got a big pay rais so he realli want to go there  hey what life if you dont splurg everi onc in a while

anyway we head over to the mgm and yeah i was wow wowd by the beauti chandeli the plush cushion in the booth seat the french linens

noth could realli prepar me for such a big diappoint 

first thing first  they refus to give you tap water they say that they onli serv bottl water and you have a choic  fizzi or nonfizzi and this is at 10 a bottl not to mention the server practic jump to refil your glass after youv taken onli 1 sip just ad to the 360 tab

a i was contempl go to the bathroom for a drink of water from the sink they brought a nice palat cleanser  a berri granit  with a citrus foam which was serv over dri ice to keep it perfect cool unfortun it went down hill from there

basici after the next three dish  tomatocoriandercaviar were a great disappoint okay the tomato was serv with a tomato gele the coriand was serv as a foamgele thing caviar three way was some sort of geleefoam thing

bi this point my bf and i was look at each other think  doe this guy do someth other than fanci jello and foam my boyfriend lean over and whisper in my ear  what your favorit dish so far my answer the bread cart an impress 16 select of briochebaguett my bf basic agre sad isnt it

okay from there thing get a littl better a realli good egg ravioli  delici a decad sea urchin flan a delect shrimp tea and a subpar lobster bonbon  compris a shellfish dish a decent turbot an okay salmon  noth too impress the japanes kobe beef was pretti good but ive had better prepar of kobe beef  befor a soybean risotto  fair but noth to shout home about

ther was an interest margarita  frozen yogurt with effervesc sugar a yummi herb sorbet mint flavor primarili 

becaus it was my bfs bday they wheel out a meringueic cream cake with raspberri sorbet it was beauti howev they gave us onli two sliver of the cake and then wheel the rest away were still wonder what happen to the rest of the cake 

then came the mignardis  the impress cart of petit four that number at least over 30 serv with coffe or tea by the way be chines  they had crappi white tea  just a few sprig sprinkl in to give the water some color

a sad thing was i ask our server which one of the petit four were her favorit  she mention shed onli tri one normal if you are a server especi at a fanci restaur like this you have a good idea what your clientel is eat heck even in the lower end restaur  the same thing but here obvious not so

so that it  we got a lemon loaf on our way out for the next day copi of the menu accompani by a sens of feel like wed been rip off 

ye the present of the food was beauti done and i was impress howev uniqu present or innov doe not necessarili mean that it will tast veri good

and the pricetag  given the ingredi that were use  is wholli not justifi other than the caviarnorweigan salmon tasteless by the waykob beef there wasnt ani ingredi that was realli expensive

becaus of that im give joel robuchon a big two star  one for the bread cart one for the petit four which were the highlight of the visit honest  to truli enjoy mayb 6 of 13 cours and pay 900 for two peopl  that a littl too muchmy analysi of the myriad of glow five star reviews
a this place is the default most expens food in vega so i think it attract peopl who arent accomplish in much other then spend cash
b when you drop 5001200 a person on dinner it is realli hard to admit that the food and experi is less the five stars

i have enjoy opportun to dine at some realli swanki place with price that do command a healthi cash flow  joel robuchon was by far the most overr unimpress and exorbit expens meal i have ever indulg  

i guarante if you are drop the cash on this experi your are like not stay at the mgm where the restaur is locat  the mgm grand  come on folk  the place is like a goddamn amus park and hold rank and class with the like of the fabul luxor and new york new york  so they pick you up at your far more modern and luxuri hotel in a funki ass old skankafi beig limo that say mgm grand on the side  right on  

like everyon gush you are roll up to some alli entranc in the back of the hotel and are usher in to an impress hotel that you will not be stay at anytim soon  person if i was drop 5k a night to stay at this privat hotel i would be piss off that they shuttl some two bit strip dweller through my privat space so they can ooh and ahh while strut through  the whole entranc thing is complet theater at the end of your tour you are dump out into the realiti of the mgms casino floor area  the hotel is old and dumpi  

the restaur design is classic stuffi french with a larg help of schizophren circus flare  dont be put off if the hostess captain and most all the wait staff put on a strang stuffi that is not warm nor is it direct dismiss  it is the perfect balanc of cocki that make most general submiss diner feel they have been bless with the opportun to dine  

the bread cart is a complet exhibit and a method to fill patron up on inexpens bread  you wont find warm fresh bread  just a bunch of gimmicki ass stale cold piec of herb chees and bacon bread

i order the full tast menu  in ask my option with the sommeli i was offer the option of three tast cost  never have i been offer the option to choos my wine pair base on cost level  to top it off the price level were some bullshit like 299 599 or 999  let just say 300 600 or 1000 for christ sake

i went with the most modest price wine pair and i was blown away with the swill they pour me 

the food was interest it was prepar well some item were delici howev most of the 16 were just uninspir combin of expens ingredi  an exampl was a piec of cold asparagus cut down the middl stuf with beluga  yay  most dish that should have come out hot or at least warm came out cold  pretti but cold
 
dessert was ridicul long wind as they felt the need to review two dozen littl candi on yet anoth cart  

mi share was 90000 and i left with a huge chip on my shoulder  never againouch not for me plate are fix price and rang from 125 to 265 and if you want the complet 16 cours meal it is 425 all of these price are per person wow who pay this price  i love great restaur but 950 for dinner for two there has to be some valu right 

the food was good but not outrag and veri small portion the desert was excel but again veri small both the bread cart and the desert cart were cool 

now let talk servic stuffi short no excit no person how about the atmospher if you like a restaur experi where everyon is eat in grandma live room and no one want to say a word without be scold this is your place too quiet for me

i would never go back to this place and would cring if i had to return as a guest on a busi tripim sorri i tri i realli did but joël robuchon fell short veri short 

pleas let me prefac this by state in my opinion no meal unless you choos it to be so should be four hour long and let me state that my rate take in to consider the experi of dine at joël robuchon which reach beyond the food itself

mi wife and i celebr our 20 year anniversari by a trip to what may be consid the best restaur in las vega or possibl the countri it start off with a bang and initi i was truli enjoy the experi we arriv and were prompt seat i was surpris by the size of the restaur as it was quit small which was veri nice actual the quaint of the size kept the sound down and made the experi much more person and the design of the restaur was contemporari and modern without be too over the top mod like mani other vega eateries

on issu to note that was a argu point with my wife and i was the strict dress polici for gentleman jacket and tie are requir no big deal happi to put it on for the anniversari howev when i dine i prefer not to wear a tie like most men i had a veri nice suit and shirt but know las vega i prefer not to wear a tie my wife insist so i begrudg put a tie on

again jacket and tie are requir to me mean just that as we walk in there were mani men dress well in jacket and tie sit right next to other coupl whos men were wear jean sport coat with open collar button down shirt with a tshirt underneath

point if you have a dress code enforc it or whi even bother

servic began veri attent and the pace was fantast the menu was describ well and we were enjoy the experi the pace of the meal is import to me and everyth was go well drink were order wine with assist of the sommeli our dine select made all is well with the world 

the bread and cours began the bread select was impress and the knowledg of the waitstaff impress everyth was amaz pre appet appet soup wine cocktail miner water water music perfect present was artist superb

and then someth happen mayb a shift chang joke or possibl the world start rotat backward time space continuum shift who know while wait for our main cours the servic came to a crawl attent still but veri veri slow it took 45 min befor our last appet and our main cours to arrive

i order the beef cheek as i was feel like have beef they arriv nice appoint slice into them they were veri tender in a miso base sauc the problem immedi was tast it liter tast like my mother pot roast this couldnt be so i tri again and sure enough mom pot roast i ask my wife if she want to tri as i explain my dilemma and sure enough i could see the disappoint on her face as everyth els had been so delightful

ok one bad dish albeit the main cours im will to overlook it howev were now stuck with this issu with servic it get slower and slower and slower the pace between the next few cours was just painful time between our main cours and dessert was anoth 45 min then our anniversari cake then we were polit told that the dessert tray need to be replenish veri polit and with courtesi but wed alreadi had been there for three hour and i was get testy

th dessert tray was a work of art and the man in charg of them extrem knowledg they were fantast as well

on thing to note i order sparkl miner water and my glass bare had a sip out of it and it was refresh by the wait staff fantast howev onc it was empti the bottl remov but i remain thirsti i had to ask for water three time each time it came prompt but be thirsti i drank it and i had to again ask for it to be refil addit i enjoy cold water this water was room temperatur no problem ill just request ice water which i did and i still got the same room temperatur water

post meal a nice littl bag was given with a great brochur recap our meal which was a nice touch then our check came in a veri time manner which was as expect 

so what is my main complaint no complaint actual more of a disappoint realli my low rate was pure base on meet expect for a well round dine experi suppos one of the best in the countri i expect a world class experi and didnt get it i felt the pace of the meal start out perfect after the main cours howev im unsur as to what happen the main cours was a disappointment

th wait staff delight and extrem knowledg and veri friendly

overal my wife enjoy it veri much and that all that matter my husband and i ate here last night and i was disappoint and felt taken advantag of  the experi as a whole was love from the limo to the decor to the servic  but noth  noth  i ate blew me away and i certain did not leav feel like the near 700 bill for the two of us was close to worthwhile

i will also add that my experi was veri taint by the fact that the moment we sat down befor we were given a wine list or cocktail menu we were offer a glass of champagn  obvious we should not have accept without request the menu first but i was shock to find that they automat serv us 45glass veuv without ever tell us that was what we were drink or hint at the price   nor was my husband inform that the tini veget starter he order had a 50 surcharg when they ask him if he want to add bone marrow to it i realiz that for some peopl who dine at jr money is no object  and although we went there expect to spend a lot i did not feel that it was well spent

i will add that when we question the bone marrow surcharg it was gracious remov from the bill  we did not say anyth about the veuv but i  suppos i was still in too much shockive bought ground beef from this sprout 3 time that has spoil befor the sellbi date the first 3 time i figur were fluke the 4th time i bought their organ ground beef instead think it was their regular ground beef that was bad and it still spoil 2 day befor the sell by date it turn brown and smell sour

they accommod me by refund my money the first 3 time but it alway was with an air of suspicion as the manag inspect the meat and alway check the receipt i couldnt get the fourth pack of meat back to the store by the sell by date and didnt want to go through anoth round of question instead i just decid i will never buy beef from sprout again

at trader joe they dont care about refund and they sure as hell dont care if you have your receipt theyll alway refund your money with no question or suspici look needless to say i wont be buy meat from sprout ever again

th onli reason they get 2 star is becaus i have to shop here for gluten free product becaus there no whole food east of tempegrrr3 girl on a thursday night decid steak sound necessary

a two of us wait for the 3rd girl to arriv our waiter stop by and say when is your friend get here i dont want to explain the menu a bunch of times

uh ok

w order the bacon wrap scallop to start believ it or not it was my first time have scallop i am not a big seafood eater but i would eat these again tasti 

while we brows the menu tri to make a select the waiter came by and was like will you close your menu when your readi so that i dont have to keep come by your tabl 

blank stare from us 

serious wtf 

were chatti girl want to enjoy a nice not rush dinner 

he pop by again and ask if were readi thank one of my friend has more ball than me and say my menu is still open and im follow your rule so 

and he walk away

w close our menus to signal our waiter and we order escargot prime rib salad soup etc

th escargot was anoth first for me it was tasti but i wouldnt order it again glad i tri it though 

mi prime rib was ok definit not the best ive ever had we also order the creme brule and it was goodnoth amaz 

while this was a place of mani first for me it will be my first and last time visit bc of the rude waiter  the price arent worth the food and servici wonder how their steak is here but dont ever come here for happi hour with a big group no joke 

i came here the other day with a pretti big group for happi hour the servic was horribl the food and drink were mediocr for drink i order the orang slice to start it was a martini but tast like a screwdriv with a splash of vodka my second drink was the pinot noir this one i like for food we order the crab cake nacho and bake brie the chees on the nacho was realli dri and didnt tast veri fresh to me i actual like the bake brie the chees and pesto that it came with was realli good 

servic ive never been a waitress and i understand we were with a big group but i would think you would go around the whole group ask what everyon want plus there were 23 waitress help with our group never onc did that happen we basic had to flag down the waitress everi time we want to order someth on top of that we ask her for the happi hour menu mayb 3 time or more and she never onc brought it we end up talk to the manag who eventu brought the menu and told him we were veri disappoint in the servic we got an apolog i wouldv thought he couldv at least gave us a small discount on the bill or someth complimentari anyth nope i wont be back for happi hournice atmospher but tfc the filipino channel on the tube set on veri loud quick ruin the good vibe for me  i start to wonder what the nonfilipino custom think of the show qualiti but then i recal judg judi montel cop etc that air on tv and i dont feel so embarrassed

food are set out buffetstyl or turoturo you point at the food you want and i quick learn that the daili lunch special menu print and display on an easel outdoor by the entranc doesnt accur depict what your go to find serv indoor  friday menu list a dish that wasnt offer bec appar it was serv the day befor and anoth dish was offer in it place  whi even bother print out a menu if your not go to stick to it  guess i better call ahead befor make the trip from laveen  one dish stood out and i ask the server if it contain ani meat to wc he repli just ginataang kalabasa aka squash simmer in coconut milk  i was starv and asid from the bistek panfri slice of beef steak and pritong tilapia at galungong fri tilapia and scad noth much interest me here  so for my lunch combo i chose fri tilapia and rice w squash green bean and okra simmer in coconut milk for my veggi  

i was have a good time eat my lunch until i notic that there were shrimp allergi in the squash dish the server appar was not awar it had meat in it could not verifi if it was shrimp and had to ask the ownercook to confirm  i thought this an unaccept practic it a good thing for him that i am not a vegetarian and a veri good thing for the venu cookown that i am not death allerg to shrimp at least not yet

th ownercook glad replac the squash dish for beef steak wc tast fine albeit salti and veri greasi although my origin buffet server was not pleas  this irk me what doe it matter to him that she replac a dish bec he was neglig of the origin ingredi  perhap he felt embarrass that he couldnt even tell there was shrimp in it but whi show discont  oh he realli made my blood boil  

ill tri to visit again to tri other lunch special and see if the servic improv  otherwis i may just spend my money at jeepney bistro and lumpia factori down the road where my eardrum wont be torment by untal comic on wowowe  i do have one posit thing to say about gingerroot it rice was whiter fluffier and better in qualiti than that of lumpia factori wc was yellow drier and just plain sorrylook enough for me not to take home to rehash in sinangag rice fri with garlic yum

i do hope that the dinner servic and menu are sever time better than that of lunch menu price made me laugh gingerroot ambienc definit place it at the top of the list of all the other filipino venu in chandler if your on a date but id veri much dislik the experi if im forc to listen and watch tfc and have buffet food at those pricethe servic was good it was clean and it was veri veri veri full of a ton of realli old peopl  i havent seen this mani old peopl in the same place at onc sinc my last trek to sun city

but i didnt hold the old peopl factor against one eye dog i like old peopl i had a minor in gerontolog in undergrad  it was just a littl peculiar  on a friday night i felt a littl like i was sit in a nurs home cafeteria

then i notic that this place was suppos to be a british pub  and their decor seem a bit um tgibritain  but im no expert on what is an authent british look so i didnt hold that against them either

but the food was unimpress  i wasnt realli hungri and i join my guest late so i just sampl what my husband order  the wing were peculiar  i wasnt there when he order but im sure that he ask for the wing to be crispi  this is the first time that i ever had wing that were too crispi  they were dessic  and the sauc was adequ hot but too vinegari and with a peculiar flavor vinegar  mayb they use malt vinegar  ive never tast an octogenarian but i imagin this is what they might tast like

th few fri i tast were like frozen french fri that i could easili make at home  our friend order the fish fri sandwich walley which he seem pleas with  the waitress told us that the fish fri dinner was even better with the side  ill take her word for it she was veri nice and efficient

it near our friend place so if he suggest it again i wouldnt say no and i would definit stick with the fish fri dinner  but i wont be rush backi dont know what it is about this locat but it not as good as the other  i come here becaus a friend of mine come here regular but i wouldnt come to this bww otherwise

mi last visit was this past thursday even  i was wait for my friend in the bar and want to order a ranger ipa  i was told they didnt carri ipa on tap or bottledwth  the other locat on north durango  215 has two ipa on tapi was there 2 week ago so i know they carri it  i ask the waiter if they recent stop sell ipa and he said he didnt know and didnt even know what an ipa beer was  i settl on a 24 oz newcastl and put away 4 or 5 befor the night was over

wow i thought that bwws were suppos to be consist with their product  i guess i was wrongwhatever

wil i come back  onli when i come to visit my friend otherwis i wouldnt come to this locat  there are better bwws in vegagood steak bad business

mi husband our son age 7 and i went to arrowhead grill to celebr my hubbi 42nd birthday 

upon arriv we were immedi seat waitstaff was nice everyth went well till the steak came out

w had alreadi had some decent raw oyster and some oknotgreat bread

 my 43 delmonico our specialti of the hous was so tough i had to send it back the waiter was appropri apologet and brought it back made me a hew one but it wasnt done till my famili was almost done with the rest of dinner and i was about full of the a la cart side dish anyway by that timeof them the cream spinach was veri good and the cheesi scallop potato too cheesi and not creami at all more like smother potatoes

th manag came over and partial apolog made sure the new one was good and told me the second steak is on us like i even got to eat the first one or the second one sinc it came out 15 min after i sent the other back for a famili of three who had spent 236 they charg me for both delmonico steak and then took one off 

bad busi the entir steak should have been remov from the bill consist with polici at other eateri of this calib it was not veri flavor but was more tender but i onli ate about 4 bite befor i was too full to eat anymor plus now i was annoy in this economi peopl are more choosi about where to spend their hardearn money whi drive peopl away with an asinin practic like that

when i complain about the polici the manag kind of shrug and said more or less it is what it is he actual smirk it was veri carsalesmanlik sorri car salesmen

w will be take our next 200 mealeat selv to ruth chris from now on veri big disappointment

on an up note my husband said his filet mignon was one of the best he ever had and i have to admit the 7 tablesid smore are well worth the time and the mere 7 if you have a kid who like to roast marshmallow and get sticki the marshmallow were homemad bug squar one cut into four piec you get to melt those over a littl flame and dip into melt hershey chocol and eat on a graham cracker that was the best part of the meal for some of us

but serious folk there a reason arrowhead cant play with the big guysthey dont treat their custom like the big guy do even though we live nearbi we will make the drive to a better place where we are bound to get the steak done right the first time and get treat right when thing go wrong so there will be a next timewe went to arrowhead grill for lunch a littl after 100 pm on a tuesday we were immedi seat we then sat for close to 10 minut wait for a server i final went back to the hostess to find out what was the problem they were not at all busi soon a waitress came over and apolog for the confus on who was our server appar it is not unusu for a tabl to sit without ani thing on the tabl otherwis someon from a sever to a manag would have notic 

two of us had the prime rib sandwich at 1299 i was expect a sandwich that tast good and had some meat on it i couldnt believ how small and how littl meat was on the sandwich it did tast good but not 13 good plus there was a piec of bone or someth hard that i bit on it was imposs to tell what it was the slaw that came with the sandwich was complet without flavor i end put the horseradish sauc from the sandwich on the slaw the sweet potato fri that came with the other sandwich were ok noth better noth worse

th third member of our parti order the onion soup and hous salad he thought both were veri good 

for dessert we had the chocol bread pud first of all whi do restaur feel that the dessert should feed a famili of four the bread pud was larger than the sandwich it was ok but the chocol cover up the tast of the bread whi have bread pud if you cant tast the bread

fin the servic we had after they decid who would wait on us was fine except befor we had receiv our dessert the waitress came over and said she need to leav she offer to transfer us to the other waiter there i ask if she did would she get the tip she said no so we paid befor finish with the meal if she had to leav earli whi didnt they give us the other server to start with

they did give us a coupon for 10 off our next visit i wont be use it 

for the price the servic is not good enough and the quantiti and qualiti of the food is not up to paralright i never thought of review the ikea cafeteria befor  but my husband and i ran into audrey w and her plus one yes kind of pathet we were both at ikea on a holiday weekend and she mention the cafeteria has not onli been review but get glow rate  you gotta be kid me  

ye the food isnt bad and some of it is actual pretti good  but usual if your eat there your fed up and in dire need of be fed which could taint your perspect just a bit  but the rest of the experi is toler at best nauseat at it worst

today was a typic experi  most of the tray were wet or dirti or both  i had to go through sever glass to find accept clean onesaccept clean not necessarili clean  the line was back up so we thought pay cash would be good  too bad the guy work did not have chang to break a 20 when our bill was 1830  most everi tabl was dirti  there was no ligonberri drink the one highlight of this experi in general to be found  a small child was spot run around like a lunat onli stop long enough to eat food off of a dirti plate she found in the clean up pile  parent  anywher  hello  unfortun i was not in the men room to wit the horror of a man chase a nake child through the restroomnak as in complet nake  luckili it was the child and not the man  and luckili it was not my husband do the chase  at least i dont think it was

so if this is everyon idea of a 5star experi im sorri for you or mayb for me for not see what everyon els doe  in ani case ive had better but im sure i will be backthis place kind of annoy me and especi so with yesterday visit  i buy most of my vitamin and supplement from an onlin compani sinc they have great price and a wide select of product  i realli onli have come here into freddi in the past after a workout at neighbor lvac for a postworkout protein drink  

they have a decent select of readytodrink protein drink here i usual just stick with muscl milk but there are fair amount to choos from here in the cooler by the door  and they also a fair amount of protein creatin builder etc powder to choos from  theyr pretti pricey thou definit more expens that you will find onlin or even at gnc  the protein bar select here is pretti mehyoul find more at target or even smith right down the road  and you basic select of supplement on the shelv too  

mi annoy come not onli from the high price they charg but it seem like over half of the product here dont even have price sticker on them  and it pretti lame and annoy to continu ask the counter clerk so how much is this  and how much is this one  what about this one  what this one price  save your clerk and custom some time and saniti and just price the inventori throughneed one last drink on a friday night we grab a tableand wait and wait  for fifteen minut we were complet ignor  we saw waitress walk back and forth but by that time 1130 pm they were more interest in hang at tabl talk with friend than pick up ani new busi even though they were suppos to be open til 2 am  

not all was lost  i was still abl to enjoy some semi decent tune befor we got the pictur and left  but not earli enough to avoid the x rate entertain  appar some drunk chick mistook a tabl and chair as a mattress and some pillow and thought the thing to do was dri hump and tri to undress her date  and she wasnt cute  ickwow i cant believ how bad the food was here 

tri to come here late night at 245 am but they turn us away cuz they close at 3 am

fin 

so we went back a day later to nurs out bangin hangov i was so excit to tri this place but what a mother effin letdown

shak head

ord the steam pork dumpl xiao long bao steam shrimp dumpl noodl soup with pork and pickl veggi taiwanes stapl and filet mignon pho tai

har gow eh it was decent 4 piec typic dim sum fare

steam pork dumpl omg what a disgrac to even call this that name i had 1 piec and was thorough offend he had a piec and made the funniest thisisgross face we left the last piec untouch 

mi noodl soup with pork and pick veggi was so bland and tasteless that i just couldnt eat it after a few bite instead i order beef noodl soup 

beef noodl soup came to the tabl 5 min later holi shit it was freakin spici as hell i thought i was gonna die they had ad 10 red pepper in there not kid my mouth throat tummi and ass was on fire im realli tick off that they didnt indic the spici factor on the menu it took me at least 30 min or more to get through half the dish

mi dc had the pho tai and said it was awesom i onli had some broth so i cant comment on it 

anyway this place is not recommend the bill was about 81 which includ a thai ice tea vietnames ice coffe and hot tea hell no never againthe pita pit is smaller and somehow feel grungier than the just step away pita factori the price are about the same and the pita ingredi are pretti similar too

thi place definit servic the post bar crowd especi those come out of caesar martini at the end of the night sinc it right across the park lot

i dunno over all this place get a big fat meh from mealmost the worst sushi ive had in my life  

i ask peopl about sushi place in kw and they all point me here  i was alreadi skeptic of an allyoucaneat sushi place

th setup you write number that correspond to differ type of item on the menu  i give them prop for varieti but the qualiti of thing were mixed

w order a varieti of thing sushi katsu fri rice tempura  servic was quick overal but they definit confus our order and gave us the wrong thing sever times

i was amaz at how crowd this place was but i forgot that this was a colleg town valu price food and im guess peopl dont realli know what good sushi is here

overal  a sad sad excus for sushi and japanes food overal but then again mayb im spoil have grown up in hawaii and current live in san franciscounfortun a disappoint experi 

went for dinner on strong recommend that sole had great food great wine select and great ambianc 

the wine select was inde extens the saturday night crowd was a blend of casual dress diner and those who obvious were out for a special occas the softlight expos wood beam warm color and wine rack made me think i had come to the right place for a delici relax meal the patio look particular enticing

but then the food came out 

the present struck me first my husband steak was stack on top of a halfyellow piec of broccoli and a few other whole veggi not the most appet plate to look at 

 my roast chicken stuf with goat chees and sundri tomato sound mouthwat on the menu but when it came out it was underwhelm a dollop of garlic mash potato the best thing on the plate with a heap of limp green and an anem piec of chicken grant chicken is not the most excit thing to order on a menu but goat chees is my weak i do not mind spend a lot on a great meal howev i definit did not feel that my dish was worth the 27 dollar price tag 


dinner did end up on a good note though  with a delici rich piec of chocol truffl cake a decent dessert and a good cup of coffe can cover a multitud of dine sin 


perhap my high expect doom the place from the start but i left with littl desir to return ani time soon i wouldnt tell someon not to go to sole but id give a more cautious endors than the friend who so strong recommend it to me in the first placewe have din at the scottsdal fleme it was excel servic and outstand food  i was so dissapoint that this glendal locat doe not measur up  the decor and atompsher is there but just not the same  look like it doesnt feel like it  we were greet immed and seat as our reserv tabl for 6 saturday night  befor mother day  the wine list was fanci electron tablet  

our server was just not attent at all and made the experi basic suck
sh never mention the special for the day the list on lay on the tabl someon discov it later
sh brought the wrong beverage
sh has to come back to ask was we order becaus she couldnt read her handwriting
nev was around to grab her attention

now to the food two of our group stress that they need they meat cook well done  one of the filet mignon was to be butterfli to make sure it is well done and the other slice filet migon was to be well done  well the ladi got their filet and they are still ooz blood  come on a butterfli filet migon and a slice filet migon not well done  realli  especi on the slice one when you slice it and see blood and pink  not well done  we had to send the 2 plate back  the guest of honor had to sit was watch some of start to eat  dont get me wrong my steak was perfect and tast great  you are a steakhous get steak cook to the right temperatur is your fort  

i am surpris that a manag was not send out to appolo or at least talk to the tabl when we had to send back 2 of the 6 main entre  he came by at the end to do a quick hello and how was everyth  well it suck but noth you can do now at this pointive had this place bookmark for age so hope i didnt just have expect that were too high

w came here today becaus my fella was crave some sushi i insist we skip our favorit ayc sushi goyemon to tri this place across town from the first bite my fella was disappoint after everi bite i got that look from him like see we should have gone to goyemon i enjoy sushi rice but this was just so overwhelm vinegari it the onli flavor we could tast i like to tast the flavor of the fish but all i got was overwhelm flavor of vinegar in everi singl bite i was veri disappoint 

i order a littl of everyth plenti of nigiri salmon skin handrol green mussel agedashi tofu seawe salad tempura calamari and a few other item that i cant rememb the seawe salad was realli sour and not my favorit version ive ever had the salmon skin handrol was pretti good i like the salmon quit a bit that usual one of my favorit thing to order at everi sushi place the onli thing that was annoy was how flimsi the handroll were put togeth they fell apart so quick and made a total mess the calamari tofu and mussel were all pretti tasti although i prefer my mussel in the shell i would order all three of those again all the nigiri was fresh and realli good but i had to dab each one to remov excess vinegar from atop it to make it more palat the dessert were pretti good my fella felt vindic a littl when he ate the tempura ice cream with green tea ice cream and then quick order anoth to finish up the meal

servic was pleasant and effici i hope this was a one off for this resataur sinc i see so mani great review from yelper i respectyelp you have fail me  i had such great hope befor visit  from all of the 4 and 5 star review and from the consist sushi thread in the talk forum

i think what happen is that the trend review realli skew review percept  either that or i just went on an off day

in regard to overal atmospher appear qualiti of food and varieti blue fin doesnt come anywher close to goyemon   this is come from someon who believ that goyemon has been on the declin of late

i left blue fin full feel sick and want my money back  what the hell is in the sauc on your eel and roll  do they put cornstarch in there to thicken it  the udon soup tast foul as well  the fri they use in their soft shell crab and agadashi tofu was definit not japanes  

the onli save grace of this place was their salmon skin salad which was delici  still there is no reason for me to come back   there probabl 100 sushi ayc place in vega and i would rate blue fin as averagi think perhap fast food chicken place hire the most stupid of all employe avail to the fast food industry

w have stop here a few time to pick up food and eat it at home not onc have we gotten what we order ok i am sure now you are think i must be the most stupid of custom for not check befor i leav well yeah i agre with you but this last time we order 12 piec i did look in the bag to see that all that we order was there i did not take the chicken out to count it we got eight piec gus call to complain and all they said was what am i suppos to do about it so i will answer that question now noth do noth and i will wise up and just bypass your store from now onfor some reason ci cis has never made it to california which would explain whi id never heard of it til i move here went here last week with some friend away from our usual area a few block north on indian school geez what a differ a few block make 

dont get me wrong i appreci ci cis recess price of 399 for the buffet that is hard to beat but it also the big draw for the crowd that was in there no sign of ani urban hipster or young profession quit a few mallrattyp or guy engag in some sort of eat contesti suppos they could have just been hungri and i dont mean to sound harsh or judgment but it depress see that person who is not just eat by himself but clear over actual the over was also be done by a coupl of group of veri obes peopl 

as for the food the buffet i suppos was worth about 399 there are two salad choic the bowl with the one i want toss with italian dress was almost gone when i got there it seem like they never bother to make a full bowl for the rest of the time they were open the soup didnt look veri appet the pasta option was just elbow macaroni that look like it had been toss in can tomato sauc the pizza was fine it didnt have ani uniqu flavor the combo i did like surpris was the mac and chees pizza no sauc just cheeseorang the way it should be when deal with macaroni figur id like the one choic that would make one carb allow skyrocket i skip dessert so no idea if their browni and cinnamon roll were ani good

th staff was nice though the clerk polit explain the choic to us oldtim and they will make a whole pizza if there a combin you want still i wont be in a big hurri to eat here anytim sooni typic like paradis bakeri they are usual good for a quick lunch and have healthier option than most of the other fast place in my area
 
this locat howev need some work the servic as alway is good but the food leav much to be desir the ice tea is atroci i cant exact pinpoint it i think the containerbrew filter need to be clean becaus the tast is stale in addit to that it is complet water down so you cant tast the mango at all i actual did a tast comparison to ensur i wasnt lose my mind after lunch at paradis bakeri i went to pv mall and tri the tea at the locat there and it was great
 
the chicken salad was also huge let down the strawberri and pineappl were not fresh they came in heavi sweet syrup needless to say i was not in paradis and will probabl pass this place on my way to wildflow go forwardi had been want to tri noca sinc it open and we final made it to a simpl sunday supper recent we certain dont mind spend 100 on a good dinner but this was not it 

hubbi got the vegetarian option beet manicotti it was better than he expect it to be but by comparison to the size of my meal his portion was quit small i got the fri chicken and wonder who the hell had name it the best in the valley when i was sit there wish i had a plate of lolo i thought the bread was way too thick and doughi and didnt care for the marinad the corn on the cob as well cook but noth special the potato salad was averag at best and the biscuit was fine the standout was the supplement of pork and bean the flavor was outstand but the bean were a tad aldent hubbi didnt particular care for his wine

now i love sweet but dessert was overkil the best thing was the cotton candi our sunda were complet soupi and then we got hand an averag chocol chip shortbread to take home

i found the servic to be overkil as well i mean i can pour my own beer for heaven sake the wait staff was alway hover what we didnt get howev was a visit from the owner who seem to stop by everi other tabl in the restaur mayb he could tell we were disappoint and just didnt want to hear itone of my favorit restaur in phoenix just so happen to have a great groupon deal so other than want to go i could now go and save some s too after a long week of work more specif a 13 hour day i had high expect 

it wasnt a terribl dinner but to me love my cocktail more than both entre is a bit of a letdown mayb it my fault for want to tri thing on the menu i wouldnt normal tri regardless a meal that would have cost us 125 without the groupon is a meal that i expect to be wow by 

crab and avocado foam salad it was like a fanci seafood salad someth about the textur just wasnt do it for me it remind me of someth you would buy at the deli counter at frys it wasnt bad but it wasnt worth 15 either 

the wild stripe bass was actual delici on top of yummi cheesi rissotto the bass was crisp on the edg but great flavor i do think it was a tad over cook but complet bearabl but the side normal im a big fan of broccolini but this broccolini was terribl bitter to the point of be ined and there were 4 sad strip of skinni green bean that did absolut noth for the dish 

the housemad linguin the pasta alon with some butter would have been a better dish than the sherri vinegar sauc it came in i get the idea of the dish some peopl like sour noodl and might get off from the pretenti of it i guess it just wasnt for me 

the star of the even 
noca royal 14
schramsberg blanc de blanc season fruit st germain liqueur
th best cocktail i have ever had im alway a fan of bevi with st germain elderflow liquer it alway add such a great flavor to drink but this drink oh man the season fruit was fresh white peach pure i would go back to noca and just throw back a coupl of these and munch on the cotton candi and chocol chip short bread they give you for free at the endnot bad but not good thank to daren i took his freebi and use them befor the movi last night   my husband and daughter ate at dickey with me and the consensus is it just meh  the food tast okay but noth outstand in tast the brisket and chicken had littl flavor other than cook no smoke  the bbq tast  onli came from the sauc which you could choos spici or sweet   the bread was good for the sandwich tast like they truck it in fresh the roll serv with the 2 meat plate tast biscuit like and was tastier but look like a roll  my coleslaw was veri bland and just tast like wet cabbag  my daughter  like the macaroni and chees  but onli caus it tast like velvetta ew    would i go here again  mayb  if i want plain meat and a side of cabbagok here is the short and not so sweet

thi place is not good over price and locat in the back of the biltmor for a good reason just think reason good restaur ie zin burger tru food capit grill are all visibl in the front of the biltimor ok enough said on location

w came after happi hour appar the time where this place is semi decent becaus food and drink are half off

w order drink that were overpr and short pour it is a wannab higher end wine loung ok on to the overpr and over salt food

beet salad was decent wild mushroom pizza was more salt than pizza burger was burnt and truffl fri were ok

th kicker of the even were when 2 women show up and decid to sit next to us when the whole loung was empti anyway they were loud and winey and complain how they had been recent dump i wonder whi then christoph gross came outsid my husband and i thought he was make the round which would have been nice but that was not the case he sat his right next to the obnoxi girl and fed into their bitch he even suppli them with champagne

wel i guess if my restaur was complet empti i would hit on pathet patron too so you guess it i will not be returnthis nightclub was a dud  my girlfriend and i stay at the palazzo as such we decid to check it out sinc we didnt realli want to leav the casino  
upon our arriv we were direct to a veri long line  we were suppos to be on their vip list and that long line was for vip guest  wtf i might as well wait at the regular line becaus it move even faster than our  this club did not live up to my expect  i expect spacious danc floor high ceil opul decor  what i saw was a tini danc floor that we could bare move  the club itself was veri small compar to xs and some other  i felt claustrophob be insid this place  my girlfriend foot got injur becaus peopl step all over us  we left after 30 minut  it was definit not one of our best experi  i want my money back  it good thing we didnt pay or i would have tri to get my money backi dont get the hype about this place oliv garden qualiti food but pricier and with slower servic my shrimp parmesan was soggi and drench in wateri tomato sauc boyfriend shrimp alfredo was uninspir and bore toss in some broccoli or a veget of some sort would not be a terribl idea overal the food was not cheap but it was mediocr in everi way and the servic was slow we wait close to an hour for someth i could whip up in 20 minut myself and have it tast 10x betterblah alway excit to tri new south side fair i head in on friday the place was dead and the tvs were blare i order the pull pork sandwich and wait about 30 minut for my order and it was horribl the pork was fatti and dri and they tri to disguis it by ad a gallon of bbq sauc on top the sauc itself was too sweet and the side of bean tast like chili overal it was bare edibl the tabl were sticki and need a serious wipe down hope the servic and food improv with agescale of 110 multipl visits
6 food
4 drinks
6 service
9 atmosphere
5 value

theyv put togeth a pretti cool space especi with the patio on the south side but ive never gotten better than averag servic and often time far from even that  the food also doesnt realli pop the way youd expect given the ambianc price point and laud of the chef  one of the mani exampl is the fri which are good themselv but come with this waytoowateri dip sauc that just make you think really

then there the bar which seem to serv the lightest pour ive had in recent memory

caveat their happi hour is the bombdigg  the food price becom not just realist but downright deal  though the pour are still just for peopl pretend to drinkso at this point weve all form an opinion of what we think of starbuck coffe  either it float your boat or doesnt

com from the pacif northwest i was use to a wide select of differ coffe place tulli and peet where it all began for exampl or ani of the number of small coffe shack that seem to be on everi corner in greater seattl  but here in the valley unless your will to track down a frys marketplac to find a tulli youll need to settl for starbucks

now that ive gotten that out out of the way i have a love hate relationship with this starbuck locat  i come here sever time each day or to the press coffe across scottsdal road  the barista are great veri friend and rare if ever get my order wrong  what is frustrat is what i call the internet moocher  becaus of starbuck free wifi polici there is never a place to sit insid and enjoy your drink and read the paper  or god forbid get up and order a refil  peopl will pounc on that seat

it was differ befor they chang the polici and made wifi free  dont get me wrong some day it actual pretti good  but for the most part it a bear get a seat and what is the capac here  50 mayb 75  that a lot of custom drink mr schultz version of peet coffe  so i would guess this is one of the largest certain most profit store in the greater phoenix area  whi chang the busi model if it isnt broken right

wel in the begin when mr schultz took over the market at peet he want to recreat that coffe hous feel that he found in pari  the feel i have here is of a colleg librari on caffein  a lot of laptop open but not a lot of coffe be drank

so if your on the run and just want to grab a cup of joe then this is your best bet in the kierland area  

but if you want to order your brew sit down and read the paper or just enjoy a convers with your neighbor  tri press coffe across scottsdal road and the real life version of frogger get there  now that will get your heart racei wish i could say more good thing about this place but i was veri disappoint  okay the girl are pretti and there is a lot of tvs  that it  the food is overpr and not veri good  same for the drink  afterward my friend and i wish i went somewher els  definit over rate  hooter would of been a better idea lol
th one bright spot was there was a guy in our group that i befriend that day  he was a childhood friend of one of my buddi  he end up pick up the check which was over 200  thank davesee the word hippi in the restaur name had me stoke as them treehuggin hippi type got to have some vegetarian food right yep

i walk up to the lil window and ask about the veggi option the guy behind the counter inform me that they have a cactus burrito and that it was one of his favorit score or so i thought

upon receiv the larg heavili stuf burrito i bit in with high hope those hope quick dissip as i found that the innard of the burrito were primar cold the cactus piec were cold the chees wasnt melt at all the onli thing that had a bit of warmth were the bean which werent even hot they were luke warm

sorri guy but a cold burrito isnt go to cut it make that cactus bean and rice hot in your burrito if you want some custom melt the friggin chees in there dont leav it ice coldso the husband has taken my yelp as a mission to find new and better place recent go to the copper door was his idea but i wont hold it against him

on a sunday night for dinner this place was empti well not complet empti there was one other coupl in the entir restaur  the atmospher is beauti wonder photograph of old phoenix a babi grand piano and the most beauti ceil tile ive ever seen not that i make a habit out of look at the ceiling

w both order the ice tea and it was incred delici  i have a feel that they add just a shriggl of sugar to cut down on the typic bitter flavor of tea without make it sweet

a maria f state the menu doe claim to have vegan option  i saw three that were labl vegan although one contain honey  i would doubt their understand of what is vegan food

then came our meal  mine was the artichok and chees stuf ravioli with shrimp or at least it was suppos to be  when the waiter brought out my dish it was just  plate of ravioli  i thought at first that i misunderstood and that mayb the shrimp was insid the pasta  so i tri to cut open the pasta and i had to put muscl into it  to my dismay no shrimp  i told the waiter that i order shrimp he look confus and said he would be back  he came back 35 minut later to say that he would take my plate and be back  about 10 minut later i get the same driedout hard pasta ravioli with 4 shrimp  the waiter said he put extra on  extra what  

the husband welldon burger was medium at best  while i was wait for my food he said that he had eaten better and larger burger at seamuss next door

luckili the waiter didnt charg us the full 17 for the man undercook meat patti and a side of cottag chees just 10  and he didnt add the 5 to my 17 dish for the shrimp not even the extra one  and the hostess saw us at seamuss afterward and was dissappoint about our experi  she was veri help nice and gave us a 15 off coupon for lunch which she said was veri good and not as pricey  i might give them anoth chanc but it wont be at dinnertimin surpris this is probabl the best chines offer which isnt say a whole lot i realli wish there was an awesom offer out there in term of chines food mexican food oh yeah some veri good place most but asian your better off stay at home and cook 

we order the asian chicken salad chicken was old and had that old gross fridg tast dan dan noodl the noodl were over cook and stuck togeth as one larg soggi noodl curri with tofu the curri had a weird perfum tast the honey chicken was pretti good as well as the hot and sour soup though neither made for good leftov 

with surpris have so mani chain it wasnt surpris to see one of these final open up a far better choic than panda express kind of sad huhi dont know if i hit ocean on an off night or what but i wont be back after my one experi here

im not a fan of this style of restaur to begin with and i found the food to vari from averag to poor

iv never had what i would consid good food at a chines buffet and have not eaten at one for year  it will like be year befor i tri one againthe prepar food section has gone downhil sinc my first review  twice ive been here on recent trip and i have notic two trends

1  less variety
2  fresh has suffer  i dont realli want prepar food that has a crust i need to break through and push to the side  yuki hate to write bad review but this place suck  im a vegetarian and i love me some salad but toss is just too pricey for what you get  ive tri it a coupl time but i wont be go back

89 dollar get you a salad but for that price i think it should come with a fountain drink and a nice hunk of bread  realli your just pay for a bowl of raw produce

and what sort of salad place doesnt have plain ol white mushroom  yeah they have portobello and shitaki but no plain  weirdthe ambienc is a feast for the eye and for the touch this much is true but one is pay a veri high price for this exclus  while i like wait in the lobbi couldnt sit at the sushi counter until it was open for dinner servic at 530p i did notic that for a venu that strive to project a life of luxuri housekeep hadnt come by to clean food debri off of the coffe tabl closest to the sushi restaur host desk  not even when a rep came by to alert me to a bar menu sit on the tabl and ask me if i had want anyth from the bar she had to have notic the mess
i order a 950 spider roll softshel crab a 10 veggi tempura app and a 19 bake lobster roll all price at 50 for one week dure their 1year anniversari  theyr all good and factor in the ostentati surround id pay 950 for the softshel crab roll but id put my foot down on the other two  50 mayb but 19 for a fivepiec lobster roll  yes it was veri tasti and yes the cream sauc was orgasm but for 19 i expect moment from the restaur scene of the ugli truth or when harri met salli take your pick
if youv money to burn or have someon els pay for the bill then this is your sushi stop near old town scottsdalmy good where are these review come from a pr compani ive seen such posit press on this restaur that when my husband tri to make a reserv and they told him that we need to wait 3 week and  bring two friend sinc they onli had a four top i was still excit to go disappoint one you pay a cork fee for your wine but the waiter are nowher to be found to pour it not onc two the decor was steril at best it was like modern look offic depot desk place in a warehous in some part and then fake pine needl and mirror in anoth kind of off mayb they need to consult a decor three although we were told to bring two peopl sinc there were no two top there were 2 of them just in our littl room alon not even includ the front area food you had no choic of appet or desert one choic  for the entre you got to choos between fish and meat but when we order the meat they didnt even ask how we like it cook it was all averag and the review all tout how involv the owner is in choos the meal but we saw no hide or hair of him until we were in the park lot readi to leav  small asid i ask for black napkin they had them but they were wet yup wet and when we decid to take a doggi bag yes for the dog they hand us a cardboard box and told us to have at it 

disappoint we will never ever ever ever ever go back again the food was ok but noth to brag about consid they onli have four dish in the whole restaur i expect to be wow not so

dont wast an even out or your hard earn cash on this place and i mean cash liter they dont take credit cardnot veri mani sushi restaur hold happi hour my top two fave sakana and kyoto do not and those that do usual disappoint w the except of temp sushi 101 pleas read my review  when i read and heard that pan asia offer happi hour i couldnt wait for my short day at work tuesday to roll pun intend around so that i may go check it out  it is with displeasur that i am onli abl to rate my experi there with 2 stars

first the happi hour menu select app for 12 off is veri limited

crispi spring roll normal 2 pcs 3
crispi crab puff this should realli read krab puff 6 pcs 4 
chicken pot sticker 6 pcs 5
spici chicken wing 6 pcs 6     httpwwwyelpcombizphotoskwkw6vveppboxfkfggpjqselectyh81hcqvvd41rzu6vsejq 
also 150 off wine and beer selections

second after read the hh menu i had to wonder if i was actual at a sushi bar and not sit at a chinesesouthwestern joint  i mean where are the 24 nigiri and sushi roll select  after glanc at the tofu and veget menu and spot a coupl of delicioussound veggi item such as garlic saute asparagus i said to my serverbartend that it was a shame that pa didnt offer veget tempura as a hh select  she said that theyr still work on it  

after food allergi spring roll pot sticker and person prefer onli eat real crab not imit i chose the spici chicken wing app 3 pcs 3 and a spider roll 10  if i had a chanc to do it all over again i would pass on the wing  i guess i was expect delici crispyfri chines chicken wing  yes i knew it would be more like buffalo wing the menu did say spici but i guess i was secret hope for wing youd normal find on tradit chines menus  also buffalo wing and spider roll realli dont go well togeth which is whi i found the hh menu so baffl  

as for the spider roll i like the softshel crab thickbatt perhap a tad too much nicelyseason and definit made me think i was get a goodsiz portion of crab meat  i was hesit in order a 5pc spider roll at 10 a pop and when i saw the product i didnt feel halfasbad  asid from the lacklust rice im not kid the rice had zero flavor just sticki white rice the roll was alright  it nice to know that the chef are will to work around my allergi but i dont know if ill be visit anytim soon a sushi restaur must offer greattast sushi rice  after all sushi is japanes for vinegar rice

so i implor the owner and chef to pleas improv upon the flavor of the sushi rice  onli then will i come back to tri the rest of your sushi offer especi those under the special sushi sashimi  roll combo menunow that i have come clean to the yelp communiti about my occasion dabbl with chain i feel it is best to cut right to the quintessenti origin chain

i myself veri seldom get anyth from mcdonald but i have kid that enjoy their french fri and the wrap they affection call crap snacks

addit my wife is not a coffe drinker and her prefer caffein deliveri method is diet coke  so the fast food joint not infrequ get the busi for the diet cokes

th reason this particular mcdonald bear yelp is that it hold a singular record one that i am at this point hope it will maintain  onc a record is set i sometim loath to see it fall

you see this particular mcdonald has been visit by myself or member of my immedi famili not less than 12 time  on not one of those occas have they produc a mistak free order  not onc  it realli rather remark  it not like we routin order dramat variat such as no ketchup or the dread can you put big mac onion on that

yet they have steadfast achiev at least one mistak on each and everi order without except  

on the occas when we visit this mcdonald we now wait with bait breath while someon check the bag and confirm that yes inde there is someth we did not order in the bag or we are miss someth we did order or someth we order is not right  pleas in the name of all that is mass consumer in america do not get this order correct  we have standard  there are bigger issu at play herewhat a disappoint  sinc my husband and i were out in scottsdal for the most recent oye we decid to stop by a cupcak shop to indulg  we settl on this place becaus of it proxim to where we alreadi were

th store on the insid is cute with pale pink and black decor  the girl work leav a lot to be desir  we didnt get so much as a hi or welcom or even a what can i get for you  it was bad  anyway after a coupl moment of awkward silenc the husband and i order a red velvet a peanut butter and a german chocol  sad there isnt much to tell you about the tast becaus youv probabl had it all befor  there is no way these cupcak are made from scratch  each and everi one tast like a betti crocker cupcak  at least they were well execut box cupcak  they are also extrem wast when it come to packag  instead of find one box or bag or whatev for our three cupcak each cupcak was individu packag in a too larg chines takeout box with a handl  what a shame  at least sprinkl use recycl materials

thi make me sad  in a world where cupcak shop pop up everywher and a good portion of them make their good from scratch you have to bring competit if you are go to get my vote  i make cupcak from scratch and i make them quit well so i know what tast good  i even give sprinkl better mark than this place  at 3 dollar a cupcak i expect high qualiti ingredi  i tast none of that  too bad  go to anoth cupcak shop insteadmore to come from the 5 other yelper in my parti who had the same experi as i did  i just want to beat them all to the punch  to sum up what they will say in what im sure will be great detail

1 the goodnotgreat reason price brunch food was total betray by the most inept servic of all time  
2 now read a bunch of other review here i see this isnt an uncommon story
3  most of the drink we had were good includ bloodi mari but make your own mimosa by buy champagn and a side glass of ojsaturday morn after a long and endur night of parti they want some filipino breakfast

it was around 11 and we assum that they would have a full arsenal of breakfast food sinc well vega doesnt wake up until then anyway

they had the lunch item out absent ani common breakfast item like fri egg garlic rice etc they did have langonisa and tocino though 

we got a combo which had lechon kawali yeah for breakfast i know and langonisa and regular rice the portion was small and for a pricey fee of 800 

the onli aspect of the meal i thorough enjoy was the langonisa am i spell this correct everyth els was just okback to my day as the doorman at the wyndham across the street i use to watch construct of this restaur such a great old build and i was so happi they were final do someth with it ive watch progress in person and in pictur as well as chat about it with my friend and three year later it is final something

th insid of the build is beauti absolut stun they did a great job with the old depart store and util a lot of space veri effici there are some neat touch here and there one be the empti elev shaft with a plexiglass cover and some mirror so you can seem see forev it not that deep the restroom upstair shame they are all upstair are awesom in a white room surround with mirror i felt like i was in a pad asylum with mirror the asylum becaus i couldnt figur the place out there is a dj booth abov the front door that is veri easi to miss and realli a cool touch the color are all brown to keep with the nostalg theme and did i mention there are mirror everywher the build and space get a 5 it just cool

w sat at the bar and were follow by a friend littl asian guy with menus and he seem genuin interest in us have a good experi he was previous across the street ask peopl to come over and tri the restaur i wish i could say the bartend was half as friend or commit to his job the bald one was extrem unfriend seem veri arrog and for a person in a loud restaur should practic his vocal skill the servic was prompt without mishap throughout but veri cold

i order the carn pizza i have to say it was one of the biggest disappoint i have had in a loooooong time i have made better pizza in my home oven that came from a box honest it had a paper thin cardboard like crust no qualiti top and not exact a memor tast it tast fine and that was it onli redeem qualiti my neighbor had the roast beef sandwich and it was no better or higher qualiti the deli counter at safeway can make a better sandwich i earlier chastis someon for judg food on open night but now i see it realli is bad there is realli no qualiti  no sandwich come with side no fri no fruit no salad noth they are about 10 and if i want a great sandwich for 10 ill go to switch and it will come with a great caesar salad on the side

thi is not a restaur but rather a bar that serv food if i think of it like that more like a bigger version of the roosevelt i can think a littl more posit about this but not much bad servic bad food bad review ill not be come back even with the walk distanc proxim it just not worth it especi for the price and to feel like a not busi staff doesnt want to be busi we are now at the point where there are other option downtown that are better it no longer a downtown where you can be mediocr and survivi wish i could love this place but i dont
it not a loung it not a nightclub and it bare a restaur the menu is spars 

the venue
it situat right downtown and sad most of these venu have to surviv off the downtown tourist from the suburb my guess is that this place is aim to give those middl age peopl a sens of the big citi and that it doe it strive to have a matur hip feel the din room employ the newli popular communiti seat ie you could find yourself share a benchtabl with the coupl right next to you and they have a dj play tranc music while you dine they succeed in that regard this doe have an old skewl slight upscal metro feel to it

th food 
a veri spars menu i had the carn pizza which had great thin crust but lack much flavor

th service
th servic staff is where they realli fail you can go to place like fez cibo or pallet and it instantan clear that you are be serv by profession not so much here quit the opposit actual our servic was what i expect from a breakfast dinner or the waffl hous the waitress was far to casual for a place like this ie it was kinda a like so watcha want kinda thing go on and honest with the current unemploy rate as well as the locat and style of this place it complet unaccept to me

so if your look for poor servic in downtown now you have three choic car breadfruit and now hannys

allinal  id say that this place is yet anoth venu that regret cater to the occasion downtown tourist and add veri littl to the sustain of a real downtown that phoenix so lack it get a mehhanni is two thingsand neither at full potential

1st it is veri chic and modern in a retro feel as far the the interior style and potenti i give it 5 star i was told the basement will be a full blown danc club in the futur but for nowthi place is complet underus there is a second bar upstair but on a friday night i count more open tabl then fill onesso clear the second bar is premature

2nd the pizza tast good the flavor i thought was there but give me a fuck break 17 buck for a crispi saltin bake at 600 degre with some toppings

drink were strongsav grace on the menu side of this review but i think the price is serious out of wack for what you get

no free birthday dessertbett and lesser place have no problem do this hell if i was a serveri would have comp it either wayit was a tabl of 10 peopl drink and my tip alon was 40 buck not to mention the unrequest tabl breadthat was put on my billwhat the fuck


it will be awhil befor i come back to hannys

lik i said the potenti for a 5 star awesom place is there but serious the clown menu need some revisionsif you want to charg this much for dine get a real menu deserv of it hope the wait staff too at one point in the night i saw 3 server stand around by the main entranc look busi asshol 


coolest thing would be the dj nest over the dine area also the bathroom which i believ use to be dress room i can total see some awesom carnal experi in these privat bathroom but i think it kinda weird the bathroom are 20 feet from the upstair barand in line of sight

hanni i wish you the bestand hope you can grow up to be what you want to be send me a kite when you doi look forward to hear from yougreat pho but i dont tip at this place i found out a while ago from a few worker there that the owner take the tip from the server one worker went on to say that even if i tri and put the money in their apron they would still get in troubl if they dont give it to the owner there are camera everywher i thought that was kind of sadso i rate this place a 2 star for good pho but bad busi pratic 

so rememb to not tiphttpwwwdickeyscombbqcravinaspx

anoth grand opening

i got an email say they were give awayi a 32 tv  299 bbq sandwich so i bit

it was from 122 so i wait until 130 and the place was i pack after i order i had to wait for a seat to open up to be abl to dinein

i order 2 sandwich to gopork  brisket
i also order a 3 meat platterpork ribs2beef brisket  pull pork plus 2 side and a roll i order mac n chees  potato salad

th food came out fast  the staff was veri attent but

disappoitn to say the least the meat was cold the food was altogeth bland and mushy

th rib were ok but bot good enough to justifi 22

this place is prici and not my kind of bbq i like it with a littl crunch and a littl smoke flavor if they are claim claim to smoke it bbq sauc is sweetwateri and warm

i will not be backi realli like the vibe at next and the cubano coffe drink is delicious

but my experi with their sandwich sad take the top three star off my review

i have eaten the sandwich three time  onc i had the tini tuna some tuna on a roll about the size of an english muffin for 495  i also tri the bbq chicken sandwich and the turkey burger both the size of a sixinch sub for 995  the tuna was veri plain with just some soft mix green on the sandwich  the meat on the bbq chicken sandwich was kind of rubberi and the bottom piec of bread was complet drench into mushi from the coleslaw on the sandwich which seem to be ad when the sandwich is prepar at the begin of the day for the display case and simpli taken out and heat for a few minut when someon order a sandwich  the turkey burger was dri and without much flavor

they were not terribl sandwich but for the price especi the larger one are entir not worth it  for 10 i expect a restaurantstyl sandwich with flavor and mayb a better side than the cheap tortilla chip they serv with it

i am not a normal negat review you can see if you look at my other review  and i work in the restaur industri for four year so i understand the struggl and i tri not to be superpicki about my food and it qualiti  but i went to next three differ time and didnt like a singl thing i ate  so i figur i should at least warn other visitor not to drop ten buck on a sandwich there

sorri next  let me know if you improv thing and i will come tri againhate have to do this but there has been a lot of chang at murphi in the last year none of which i can report as be good this place use to be consist great with servic and food but im sad to say it not anymor 

began earlier this summer when the food start be hit or miss some day it was the stellar food we all came in to have at lunch and other day not so good to the point that the last three time were bad and the larg group of us havent gone back and probabl wont the food thing came down to if a certain chef was work  if he was there good if not bad start ask the waitress and figur out the trend 

fast forward to today and that chef has left and no longer work there which lead me to understand whi the last 3 time in a row the food has been subpar like what make a tomato hard wasnt green or unrip but hard like tough to cut hard wtf i dont know enough to know this is a reason the food has got wors but typic if your look to franchis you get differ food vendor that can deliv the same type of food to your locat all across the countri so think frozen food instead of more fresh stuff etc i mean it make sense
also when you have a train chef quit whom made great food and tailor to group that want more expens off the menu lunch and cater for local busi  event someth up i can onli assum it was the qualiti in food and the new direct 

 mean i also found out chandler news and biz journal that murphi is want to franchis and chang their name to irish republ and some of what go on insid girl with slight differ garb kilt and kneehigh etc not so much breastarauntish but similar 
trademark info httpwwwtrademarkiacomirishrepublicpublichouse85274024html

servic much like the food the servic has gone down in qualiti there never seem to be enough girl dure what use to be the lunch rush and an hour lunch quick turn into 130 lunch wait on fillup and food and the check it not horribl servic girl are nice and friend just slow 

in summary
w havent return in at least 4 week and it just not an option when think of place to eat downtown chandler anymor from 5 to a 2 meh ive experienc better

i miss what murphi was  we all doi agre whole heart with my fellow yelper phil s who state miss the mark for excel  ingredi are wonder fresh and topqual butprado feel a bit overrated

i order the beet salad becaus it sound so differ  when it arriv i could not help it it just fell out of my mouth i said that is the smallest salad i have ever seen  the waiter who was awesom did not skip a beet couldnt resist and respond with would you like some fresh green to go with that  you have to love the man and you have to love the profession becaus they did not charg me for that great littl side salad

th atmospher is just gorgeous right down to the gorgeous men have drink poolsid at the more casual restaur roq across the courtyard

but the menu in my opinion just use fanci word for sandwich like chicken and tuna salad and isnt truli differ or appealdos estrellas

mi review has been fed into yahoo babelfish text translationtwic  first english to spanish then spanish to english

sorri just cant recommend this placei must be a snobbi snobbi bitch 
nope just sober
trust me i tri to remedi that as quick as possibl so i could deal with this place we were there on a saturday even around 9 mayb it okay as a sunday day drink spot but ill never know  becaus ill never be back

long stori short
i came uncomfort close to get into a physic alterc with a man yes all 112lbs of me and some of you will be surpris that i was not the instig i was not 
you know that look that certain sociopath type look that serial killer have the eye are set a littl too close togeth and their head slight resembl a loaf of bread pinch in at the templ well that this guyannnnnnd all of his equal roid out homi the experi was actual scari and i dont scare easili 

killer wasnt the onli reason for the sour tast in my mouth the place was a littl campycheesi and not realli in the way i like i cant realli put my finger on it but it just wasnt my thing the servic was slow but the place was pack to the gill with everi ass clown on the planet so ill cut them some slack there we want to eat but there was no place to sit as ani of the open tabl had reserv sign on them ohreallllli bottl servic anyon lame 
im not sure if that was the case or not it just seem douchey and tri hard shocking

i will say one thing this experi and the few other that ive had lead up to it have made me come to term with someth veri special i dont belong here and by here i mean scottsdal unless of cours someon would like to take me to citi hall for a sexi steak dinner that my idea of a good time i doubt high ill fear get punch in the face at mastro 
fuck im olddont sit at the bar no one help you

thi is by far the worst servic i have ever had i love grimaldi the pizza is great but the servic was just terribl up front stand three hostess that cannot figur out how long the wait was each one of them said a differ time and were extrem rude one final said the bar was open seat so for the first time we sat at the bar i notic a huge parti leav from the patio so i ask a hostess if the patio is open seat it was not so i then ask if the wait was still as long she inform me that peopl were ahead of me which was understand howev no one was wait so i went back to the bar and said it fine we will just deal with it some better spot outsid open up so we move seat from in the bar to the outsid bar area i watch two tabl stay open the entir time of our meal which was 2 hour long i was readi to leav had i been abl to tell the waitress to cancel our order the reason i give it 2 star instead of 1 is becuas in the end the amaz pizza made up for the terribl servic i love the pizza and next time i think mabey i will order it to goafter so mani review updat i usual ceas to write more unless i have someth realli noteworthi to add a new menu addit or fave dish or great custom servic render etc  unfortun i will have to say that this morn breakfast of biscuit and gravi and a platter of peach creme brule pancak didnt have us leav w happi stomach   

there were a coupl of hitch but these were easili amend  i think my love affair of dds biscuit and gravi has end  my major gripe was that our gingerbread pancak did not contain candi ginger piec did daili dose switch to a new mixformul  if yes pleas switch back  the pancak we had today were too dens and not at all the flavorfulspici and texturallyexcit cake weve had in the past   the peach creme brule sauc also didnt arriv warm and instead was squeez unappet onto a sauc dish  the leftov that i usual get to enjoy again on one of my work break end up in the trash

im go to go back again soon to give dd anoth tri id like to keep it on my list of fave brekki placeim go to stand by this statement if the manag has to bring  burn spray and lemon to your tabl regardless of fault youd think mayb at least one thing would be comp like a mimosa to eas the pain  im also go to stand by my opinion that it was the hostess fault for put the menus on top of a precari stack set of sliver ware in the middl of the tabl which in turn caus a menu to slide off and spill pipe hot coffe all over my lap

i did not make a big deal of this incid so mani reader might think well if you didnt say anyth you dont deserv anyth   let me point you back to the first sentenc of this review  good servic is good servic and shouldnt requir me whine about anyth  

the brunch itself was pretti tasti though the kitchen might not know the definit of what an overhard egg is suppos to be  i did like me my gingerbread pancak and there were some other delish dish had at our tabl  food 35 star servic 1 starit was earlysaturday the wife and i cruis up to daili dose for a breakfast morn out the place was relat slow when we arriv which is whi i was a bit mif at how belowaverag the servic was 
like the good patron we are we wait to be seat onc seat we waitedand waitedfor menus then waitedand wait for ani servic then waitedand waitedfor coffe which still is some of the best restaur coffe ive ever had then waitedand waitedand waitedand waitedfor our food then waitedand waitedand waitedfor our water and coffe to be refil so i got up and tri to find it myself 

the food is good the breakfast potato are delici i order the mix berri pancak and they were tasti as well our server was friend but there was just a lack of it i guess after 2 tri well stick to our other breakfast hangoutyou will see the same group of old peopl here everi day i am not exagger they come here everi singl day due to this the restaur manag allow them to have an express ticket to the front of the line and they get their own seat area next to the food so that they dont have to walk far 

the elder regular i mention complet hate when outsid come into their restaur ive been here 3 time and everi singl time multipl regular complain to me that if ian outsid didnt come to eat here today there would be a shorter line and shorter wait time for them  last time i was here the group of regular who were stand behind me at the cashier were loud complain about how it was a travesti that they had to stand in a line to pay now that outsid had shown up ever sinc rampart chang manag they have been send out free buffet coupon to player club member therefor this buffet has becom extrem crowd back befor they start send out comp onli the same 2030 regular would show up for dinner everi night now there are 100s of new peopl show up and it make the regular realli angri so expect one of those angri old peopl to yell at you 

the best thing about this place is that they have this realli cool coffeecomput thing that instant make ani kind of coffe you want you dont have to wait 20 minut for the server to bring it to you it all selfserve

thi is summerlinnw vega so there will be a lot of bitter peopl fight and argu about stupid thing the last time i came i saw this guy whine becaus the guy in front of him got a bigger slice of prime rib he kept shout his was bigger than mine that not fair it an ayc buffet just ask for anoth slice wtf is wrong with these peopljust a quick review about some take out cheesecak from this place
mi husband and i went by this restaur last night to tri some of their cheesecak that we heard is to die for
w walk in and were greet by the friend bartend who told us for take out just go to the back where the cash regist was and they could help us with our order  
first off the ambianc for this place is realli noth to write home about and is veri bore  so we werent impress with that aspect of it like i said befor the bartend was nice but i cant say the same for the guy at the cash register
h was rude  no greet no smile and seem bother that we were onli order the cheesecak to go  we even told him that we heard that the cheesecak was to die for and he didnt even blinkh took our payment and said itll be up in a minute
i want to come back at anoth time and tri and entre or more but not now
servic is a huge part of a busi and the servic here made this custom not want to ever come back to this place again we also will not be recommend this place to ani of our friend or family
a for the cheesecakemi husband like it but ive had betteri have not return yet although i expect to soon as i have a plan event at press next week but i think it is fair to share that the owner contact me regard my review  he was of cours in his word disturbedal i can say is i apolog for your experi and onli ask that you give us a second tri if you are in the area

that is good reput manag and appreci by methe texa station around the world buffet

wher to start with this place i guess it still a cheap buffet under 10 you do get a free game of bowling

but it a shitti casino in an even wors neighborhood

th buffet is the highlight of the place and that not a good thing

they buffet servic is alway quick  friendlythey still serv your drink which is nice

now for the food blahyuck they have a nice varieti from chilimexicanmad to order fajita soup  salad italian  pizza southern with rib  chicken asian home cook with meatloaffishchicken and veggi then their seafood and deep south with crawfish and the like

noth is veri good it like they cant use ani season or spice becaus they are worri about offend or tuen off one person so it just bland

i leav this place everytim say never again but for some reason usual a comp i end up eat here and regret it from the first trip to the buffet i usual come back with  half a plate wonder whi am i even wast my timethe 2 star are for the food that the onli thing about this place that was posit 
we came here to celebr the engag of friend on a saturday night there were 12 of us 12 peopl militari new to vega that would most like come eat here again and tell other peopl to come here if it was a good place to eat 
from the begin our server was rude when ask if someth was good he respond yeah it all good  i ask if he had ani cracker as we had a squirmi 9 month old with us he say no no crackers
fin after 10 more minut of more whine i desper ask if they have anyth even bread that when he bring out the bread for the tabl clear he was not go to bring that out unless we ask for it nice dont get me wrong i know i should have brought my own food for the babi but i wouldnt have care if the server even just said no sorri we dont have cracker he was just so short with us it was offens 
there was a girl assist him in refil drink etc our drink were refil onc and were never touch again 
the thing that weird us all out was when we order entre the server said soup or salad so we all pick our soup or salad one of the pepl with us ask him what kind of salad is it is it ceasar and he say yeah you can have that if you want at this point i was confus and ask what kind of salad we order and he said whatev we want yet he didnt have us specifi when we said salad that when it came to our attent the entre didnt come with a side he was just upsel and be extrem sneaki about it 
oh yes and he correct my husband on the proper pronunci of the dish he order veri profession 
when we order i ask for separ ticket 
the food came out relat fast it was good
w were never ask if everyth was good 

final it was time to pay he brought out one separ ticket and then group the other 9 peopl on one ticket even though i ask for them to be divid when we order when the other peopl ask for him to divid it he told us nobodi but them ask for separ tickets

th gratuiti was not ad to our ticket and i onli tip 10 the other peopl we were with did that same if not less after rude collect the tip slip befor we were close to leav he slam down the girl share of the money for help him and she said thank loud and glare at our tabl oh that remind me they were shine silverwar dure the meal and i watch her pick someth off our server face as she had silverwear in one hand after she was done get his eyelash or whatev it was she went right back to touch the silverwar i want to gag 

i have been a waitress i know the job isnt easi especi when you have bigger tabl but the place was pretti much dead on a saturday night i now understand whi and this guy didnt tri at all  i dont think we will be back and that make me sad becaus that margherita pizza was damn good so was the antipasto salad 
bad servic just ruin that entir experithis is my first of mani review from our mini stay in vega the reason i chose this to review this one first was to warn you do not get sucker into tri this wanna be steakhous the premis seem cool  first everi 20 minut or so the decor of the restaur chang but after a coupl switch it get old 

so onto the meal to be honest the meal i had was not bad at all i kept it simpl sinc i wasnt super hungri start off with the lobster bisqu which was actual excel rich creami bisqu and an ampl amount of lobster was off to a great start 

for my meal i had the kobe beef carpaccio warugula salad and mac  chees both were good but i wasnt blown away by either  

mi real beef with this joint is two fold the first problem is we went here be entic by the tast of wynn menu they had offer an app entre and dessert for 69 on the websit they offer a 9oz filet howev onc you got in the door the filet was not an option instead the substitut a slice ny strip when we ask the waiter they said they stop offer the filet becaus they were lose money realli your lose money becaus your offer an 8 cut of meat for 60 hmmmm

here a tip you pretenti use douchewat recepticl your not lose money becaus your offer filet at a discount price you cant get peopl in the door becaus the food is averag overpr albeit expect sinc it is vega but the servic is absolut horribl we bare saw our server besid him take our order and present our check and for what we paid i expect a littl more mayb if the waitstaff didnt act like they were do you a favor by bring you the meal you are pay an arm and a leg for youd be abl to get peopl in the door  i must not be the onli one with this opinion either sinc the restaur wasnt even 14 full on a friday night unless someon els was pay i wouldnt go backhow could anyon of japanes lineag give this place more than 3 stars

thi place is complet market and design for western when you walk insid all you see are white folk hawaiian and a random korean guy sit in back  there were absolut  no one of japanes descent eat here

befor i write my review let me tell you a person stori about my dad everyon from hawaii will tell you stori about that one japanes famili who live on their street who absolut refus to assimil to hawaiian cultur they didnt speak in that wakki lakki talk hate say aloha refus to call their brother brahduh and thought surf was the sport of idiot these japanes men rais their kid in a tradit japanes style and that was how my dad was rais so he know good japanes food when he see it my dad came to miko about 2 year ago and hate it so much that he call me and told me never to come here i didnt believ him back then becaus my dad liter hate everyth for no reason he even hate urusawath most famous sushi bar in la and got into a fight with the chef so when i walk in miko today i had total forgotten everyth he had told me about this place for the first time in my life i actual agre with my dad on someth this place wasnt a japanes restaur  

when i first walk in i stood at the front desk for about 5 minut befor anyon even said hi to me the man work herewho look like he was half white and half hawaiianjapanes was too busi kiss the ass of the regular custom to even bother seat me the regular custom here get all the prioriti even if they order 15 minut after you order they will get their food befor you do 

when i was final sat it took him anoth 5 minut to come back over and take my order and after he drop my bowl of ramen off he never came back over again this whole time i was here he was act lazi and have fun with all his regular customers

som place use a tonkotsu base for their miso ramen while  most place use a chicken bone base miko izakaya use water mix with a powder 

the 2 slice of narutomaki were noth more than generic prepackag swirl fish cake you buy at greenland market it a product of south korea

th hanjuku egg was noth more than just a hard boil egg with no soy sauc and the egg was veri hard boil 

the charsiu tast like it was made day in advanc it didnt even tast like pork it tast like an oven roast piec of dri out turkey 

the miso ramen broth tast 100 ident to nissan ramen instant miso flavor which you can buy at both greenland market and japan creek

if you want good ramen in las vega go to place like ramen sora shuseki yagyu yakinku anim ramen has not been the same sinc ryosuk went back to japan but it still far superior to the instant cup of noodl you get at miko 

this was a 1star experi the food was 1star and the servic was 1star the onli reason i am give this place anoth star is becaus when i was leav the sushi chefa true fullblood japanes man tri to get my attent  he then gave me a certain uniqu look which i rememb from my youth with my dad while i was eat i did notic the look of concern that the tradit japanes chef had on his face when he notic i was be ignor tradit japanes men do not have to use word to express their feel of regret when i was walk out the door he let me know with facial express and bodi languag that he felt it was wrong that i was treat so bad i thought it was a kind gesturthe best thing about this place was the bathroom they were great i would pee in them ani day of the week the food lobster fillet mignon was noth special and for the price i would have expect a littl more food then what i got that for sure the food came almost too fast which gave me the impress that the food was premad and just microwav and most of it was almost cold  so if i was them i would invest in a better microwav 

they did have good shrimp but you onli get 3 

i have definit had better and paid less for iti met client here for bfast sinc they open earli there were four in our parti and the waitress was attent and friendly

b a homemad corn beef fan i opt for this entre and when it arriv the size was overwhelm larg like most of the entre here the corn beef was unfortun over salti and ined so i onli ate part of my scrambl egg when the waitress came by to check on us i mention how bad my corn beef was and she ask if i want anyth els which i declin when our waitress return she advis me she advis the chef and remov my entre from the bill which was a nice gestur everybodi els in our parti seem to be happi with their food

i wont let this negat experi keep me away from egg work  hope the next experi will be betterthe food is exact the same as ani other mcds so what im rate is the servic it not great 

mi number 1 pet peev at a drive through is when you pull up  sit there without be acknowledg for what seem like an etern is it realli that hard to say ill be with you in a moment appar at this establish it is

th other thing this particular restaur has done quit often is get some part of my order wrong i ask for dr pepper i get coke it littl stuff but still not what i ask  paid fori have to say that im am so disappoint with posh at this time the food just fail to wow that and with an excruci long 2 and a half hour 5 cours meal was pain figur and physic the seat were so hard 

the idea here to to select what type of eater you are vegetarian carnivor seafood or chef choic then you outlin the thing you dont like as well as dietari restrict great concept even now i still think it a great concept but i dont think mani peopl are go to get it or are that adventur i think posh would have done well in a foodi citi like san francisco but i dont think it go to take off here 

the chef doe select great ingredi and seem to be veri confid in his knowledg of cook plus hes veri creativ 2 of us were low carb of the 4 in our parti but none of the dish were much differ between us for instanc they receiv a portion of kobe beef and we got a lamb chop we could have just switch plate and it would have been the same effect though when i saw sweet potato in the plate i knew that id have to eat around it while the chef sent his apolog he should have come person and offer anoth savori cours my rear was hurt so bad i pass on it did get a chees cours for dessert which was good but all the fruit around went into the trash low carb usual mean no fruit 

im sit here just realli disappoint and well hungri if your realli hungri order more than 5 cours if not well youll be look for someth to eat afterward btw the cooki plate in the end was bigger than ani cours we had though with be on a low carb diet was kind of torturecruel sinc i couldnt eat ani of them we did leav hungry

her a list of plate that we had

mach salad wcucumb and blood orange
fennel soup with endiv salad
shrimp with curri and salsifi puree
sanddab with roast turnip 
lamb chop with turnip and sweet potato
chees with pickl and fresh fruitthe concept at posh restaur is improvis cuisin i think of someth improvis as be made up on the spot done without prepar what an excit dine experi that would be albeit fraught with danger for both the chef and the patron but dont go to posh expect that the day menu is set long befor you arriv and all you get to do is check off on a print list what protein you dislik so they wont be serv to you it disconcert to be ask to think about food you dont like at the begin of a meal your other decis is how mani cours you desir and if you want wine pair from 45 per person for 4 cours 77 with wine to 110165 for a full tast which is more than 7 courses

     our meal start off promis we share a nice cocktail call a cosmonad 9 made with hangar 1 citron chambord and lemon an amus bouch of papaya sorbet with mint caviar was delici this tini spoon doesnt count as a cours  my first cours was an heirloom tomato salad with haricot vert and a few shave of chees with someth this simpl  the ingredi need to shine and these did not  the tomato while ripe had littl flavor and there was so littl chees it impact on the dish was neglig ken vichyssois with chive oil was pleasant enough for me the fish cours was sea bream with bok choy the fish skin had been blast with a propan torch which render it beauti crispi the asiani sauc on the veget was pretti salti a harbing of thing to come ken receiv shrimp they were call some fanci name serv with gnocchi babi garlic and a blast pepperi aioli the shrimp had been way overcook render them rubberi and tasteless 

     on to the meat cours mine was venison serv on farro which is an italian whole grain with a rhubarb gastriqu first i took a bite of meat  it was flavor but tough then the farro i gasp and almost choke it was that salti the insipid gastriqu was total overpow by the other element of the dish ken was kind enough to swap plate with me and his brais short rib hard a season dish was at least edibl though also oversalt interest enough it was serv with fingerl potato make this the third dish in a row serv to ken that contain potato assum that the gnocchi had been made with them when our waitress cooli profession throughout ask if we enjoy this cours we mention the salt issu and she said she would inform the kitchen

     final dessert we were both given chocol cake cut into unattract chunk mine top with cube of apricot and ken with plum neither of these fruit complement the cake which contain a distract larg amount of pepper the drizzl of chocol ganach was tasti at this point we were serious consid go to crudo to have dessert sinc we need a satisfi conclus to the evening
just then our server brought us a complimentari chees plate an apolog for the salti food that turn out to be the high point of our experi along with the amus bouch the chees select was excel and the butteri grill bread outstanding
but for 130 youd expect more wouldnt you

     i strong suggest that if you want a an except tast experi you should visit crudo cafe you even get to choos the food you like to eat not those you dontnever in the histori of gastronomi has there been a more cleancut loveitorhateit dine concept as posh improvis cuisin i was liter drag here by friend who had enough credit left on their card and who want to show me how out there scottsdal could be 

posh is differ realli differ you dont order you check off a long list of thing you like and dont and they concoct someth on the fli for you youll never know what you are about to be serv or what it will cost but you can assum it will be strang and so expens that you will be abl to watch your fico score drop

thi is a place that is tri to be the snootiest restaur ever while pretend to be a relax friend environ i did see some normal peopl but i saw a lot of the type one see in north scottsdal and san marco ca you know the type those out to impress  most themselv by be differ realli differ 

if art is what you like instead of food this is the place to be it is all about present and dulcet tone describ what has just been put in front of you it realli is a beauti present but i have no freakin idea what it was even after ask for the explan to be translat into a languag descript are a lot like a real estat brochur spacious upscal beauti wonder eleg without ani hint of substanc it tast like tuna that had been marin in a puddl and hit with some soy sauc the teepe of veggi that hover abov it was interest i didnt know whether to eat it or wrap a tortilla around it and reenact the night befor the battl at the littl bighorn in miniatur 

i just dont get or like the concept so perhap i am be unfair to this hole in the wall on scottsdal road in a build that look like a bomb out munit factori from dresden germani circa 1944 peopl live in that place it remind me of stanley kubrick a clockwork orang yeah big buck to live abov the store i get it it scottsdal and this is trendi do a foreclosur and resal search of that zip code and youll see that at least seventi percent of the build is up for sale often with notat such as fulli furnish and motiv seller i bet theyr motiv it all fit with the wannab natur of posh and the peopl it seek to inculc  

posh is a restaur where onli the truli adventur need appli after check their credit worthi it a nich restaur and im clear and happili not in that nich for a total uniqu and almost otherworld dine experi this is the place they have no competit in this area they are without peer when it come to origin and invent on a scale beyond comprehens this is the area where posh shine if az88 is your thing this is az88 on a combo of crack and meth i did not care for this place but i am sure the feel is mutual while i feel the food merit one star base on goofi and price im give posh two star just for have the cojon to push out this concept on scottsdal and not to crack a smile when deliv the checknot exact my idea of paradise

mi small bbq chop salad had pile of ined salti chicken 450  i pick out the romain lettuc corn kernel and dice tomato  js california turkey sandwich with turkey bacon lettuc cucumb and veggi spread was better 750  howev the best part of his sandwich was the fact that it came with a chocol chip cookie

that what i get for tri to be healthi  

well mayb in the purgatori of airport food it is

62012i dont like chain restaur becaus they almost alway disappoint the food is bland and tast prepackag andor over salti the portion are strang either way too much or hard enough french fri to cover the plate and the servic isnt the best 

mimi is no except 

mi girlfriend and my friend and i came here around lunch time on a saturday afternoon becaus it is close to my hous and none of us felt like drive veri far i immedi regret the decis onc i start look at the menu and watch the food travel through the hand of the waiter in our section 

mi girlfriend order cinnamon french toast it was dri and took too much effort to chew and eat my friend order some type of egg benedict i order a grill chees sandwich with fri and a cup of tomato soup 

you cant realli mess up a grill chees sandwich right that what i thought yet somehow they were abl to make it tast bland and dri the fri were okay but i onli receiv about a hand of them the waiter and chef see the plate befor they are taken out to the tabl right they can tell the plate look like it was thrown togeth by a three year old right aw 

 the tomato soup is the onli thing worth talk about becaus it is pretti consist good and it is probabl the onli thing on the menu that is consist good and the onli reason whi this review get more than one star it is also the onli reason i was abl to enjoy my grill chees sandwich dip  yum

anoth thing that realli bother me waiter who are obvious tri to sell you someth we said we didnt want ani drink you dont have to tell me or ask me 4 more time if i want to tri the new mimosa  i alreadi order a diet soda and a water and i alreadi said no  polit pleas dont make me feel like im walk through a use car lot on presid day 

and im usual not extrem critic of servic but serious guy and to top it off the servic was extrem slow

everi time i go to a chain restaur i regret it never again and honest guy with so mani other mom and poptyp place open up spend 1020person at mimi realli isnt worth it 

make them step their game up befor you eat hereyogurtolog is a great concept for 45 an ounc you fill your own extra larg cup full of frozen yogurt with flavor rang from tart to cooki and cream perhap 10 flavor avail at ani given time after you fill your yogurt then you are in complet control of your top fruit cereal cooki even baklava so you have to be care becaus this will add up realli fast what you might consid a small is mislead due to the fact that they onli have one extra larg cup size so even the larger portion still look small in the huge cup

aft hear so much about this place we all decid to go ahead and give it a tri me be on a low carb diet figur that they wouldnt have anyth to offer so was i surpris to see that they have a sugar free tart frozen yogurt so i fill my cup with the sf tart strawberri and blueberri end up with an 11oz cup ooop had no idea first bite veri veri good a mellow tart follow by onli a slight chemic after tast howev within 20 minut of finish the cup i was have stomach cramp within an hour i was cling onto the hope of my underwear stay clean thank good i made it home 

so this place went from a 4 star to a 2 star for sugar free it still tast decent enough though whatev they use to sweeten it bewar can caus stomach irriti was so excit when i read about this place  it was someth i never thought id find backstori  when i was a teenag and would hang out weekend in harvard squar my favorit place to eat was warburton  anyon rememb it it all connect with the susan howatch novel penmarr i was read at the time  anyway i digress suffic it to say that the whole pasti concept was intrigu and this place was terrif it close down year ago but i kept hope id find someth similar  someday

to present day newli come to the area we final made it to the mesa locat i was glad there wasnt a wait but walk in was a strang experi it was dark loud with no one at the entranc to seat us figur it wasnt that kind of place the decor was a definit turnoff for me  cold weird seat that felt like a black and white railroad car i hate to be nitpicki but the first thing i saw when i sat down was a spider go up the wall next to me

ok enough on atmospher the food  huge menu that a lot of fun to look at with lot of choic i had the greek salad and greek chicken pasti the salad was great  enough for 2 mh had the mexican which was actual quit spici and hes veri use to spice overal our opinion on the pasti was  ok quit fill  we onli had half each howev we thought theyd be a bit bigger to justifi the cost or a dollar or two cheaper sinc they dont come with anyth els  the dough was sturdi well form for hold the fill but it was definit hard

r the servic  it was good  she was friend  but it was hard to find anyon when we want anyth especi when we want to pay and leave

i hesit write this sinc everyon seem to love it so much but this was my experi  not bad but not somewher i want to spend my precious restaur dollar for a soso experi the atmospher was kind of offput given everyth i dont think well be back and i had such hope sorri cornish pastihmmmm idk is it a gourmet hot pocket 

i had the banger and mash i probabl would have like it a lot more had it not been hot pocket style the gravi was great there wasnt a lot of sausag and i love the grill onions

w also split the pbj and that was alright i like the rasberri jam but idk the whole wrap everyth in a dough sorta turn me off not sure if i will go backthe food was just okay on a late sunday night  we had the slider chicken strip green bean fri and buffalo wing  didnt care much for the chicken strip though  they were on the sweet side and bread too much  sinc it happi hour all day and night here all of our dishesappet were half off 

unfortun our happi hour end earli  we had a server who was rude and lifeless not at all happi  we never saw her smile and she was alway rush  it realli look like she hate her jobwhich reflect on our dine experiso i love all thing top chef in ani of it various form and i am tri to have a top chef food babi befor i die  i am slowli but sure work my way up to this goal with much plan  so imagin my surpris  nay sheer delight  when i espi in mccarran airport termin d david burk burk in the box  whaaa  sinc it was 1020 in the morn i was nurs a hang and gamblingov and we had almost two hour to kill befor our flight i thought breakfast here at a top cheftouch eateri in the airport would realli scratch a lot of itch  all it did was irritate

aft drool over the breakfast menu i couldnt wait to sink my teeth into a pretzel bread eggwhit sammi with tomato shroom and feta the server inform us breakfast was over at 10 and we were now on the lunch menu  im sorri breakfast end at ten did you say  i get that this is vega and time doesnt realli existcount here but on what planet  besid high school  do peopl eat lunch at 1005  so i end up order a ten dollar tuna sandwich and husband end up order a caesar salad

wow david burk  justwow  salad was romain cuke tomato asiago complet unconvent ingredi in a caesar and ken dress in a baggi  so bore husband kept doze off in the plastic bowl it came in and near poke himself in the eye with the plastic cutleri  my sandwich was fine  the tuna salad itself was actual quit good with all white meat albacor caper celeri onion and a touch of mayo  but the rye bread was realli thick and realli dri so i end up just eat the salad off of it  the fri it came with were crispi and golden but didnt have a ton of flavor and the tissu thin paper napkin couldnt keep up with my greasi finger  i overheard anoth waitress tell a differ tabl that for 1 extra they could add asiago and truffl oil to their fri  gimm a break burk  truffl oil fri and ken baggi dress on the same menu  make up your mind

servic was actual pretti good especi sinc it was our server second day  he was on top of the ball and we never had to wait long for anyth  he even swoop in with a drink refil befor i had the chanc to open my big mouth

best part about burk in the box  watch the bear hand the cowboy their butt on home turf

top chef david burkrichard zs faux dalla g review is brilliant i reward mediocr if their heart is in the right place but i knew what i was get into by go here for lunch chipotl same stori rice the burrito is all rice i ask for just a littl and i still had a rice burrito mani of you are say but your a vegan what do expect well bean guacamol tomato pico salsa hot sauc onion a vegan burrito could be amaz what i had was white rice in a tortilla 

for me one star but i am bias by their meat centric busi model the restaur was full peopl must like it two starthe spous and i went to pastabar after see it on yelp and we were underwhelm for starter the storefront or what may one day be the storefront is unfinish and face an asu park lot which led us to believ the place was close we park anyway and walk down a hallway past sen and some outofplac look sport bar when we final found the entranc to pastabar we still thought it was close there was no one greet custom at the door and none of the tabl by the entranc was seat thank gawd were nosy

everyth els about the experi seem like a work in progress too the dine room was empti not a good sign for thursday night our appet fri mozzarella was cold in the middl and sit in water which made it most ined the main entre were creativ but way too small despit be close to 20buck each spous thought his ravioli tast bland though i did enjoy my fettuccini tagliatta

our server was fantast he care explain the menu and offer recommend but i got a big bone to pick with ms thang behind the bar both spous and i order wine hes red im white the wine portion were typic enough to make my cheek warm but certain not enough to make up for mushi mozzarella anoth coupl came in after us and befor they were seat they stop and said hello to the bartendress they were in the same soror or someth i watch her pour their wine glass and they were about twice the serv as our stupid wine nazi

w probabl go back to pastabar but not for sever month until ya know they finish build itthe call came at 1130 amwer here at park central wait for you to go to lunch downtown i said lunch is tomorrow not today but i said ok bee there in 10 minut 
friend sayss he heard that pasta bar was good so let tri that i said yeah there are 3 restaur there a irish pub turf a thai restaur sen and pasta bar i said larri like thaiphil said phil like italian and that was the fate decision

i knew i was in troubl when we enter the restaur and first there was not a sens of entri nor anyon to greet us other than the strong smell of newli paint wall bartend said sit where you like 

two of us had the lunch special about 12 and friend who suggest pasta bar order from the menu his pasta was 15 lunch special came with a drink i will say the pasta was veri tasti the salad had veri good thought and fresh local grown produc salad and pasta lunch special was serv on the same plate which to  me was unappet lunch came with a veri thin slice of bread bread was excel but no butter serverbartend was made awar and out came a the smallest portion of butter i have ever been serv and to be share with all three of us there was enough to cover half a triscut wafer pasta was fresh but without ani meat 

the atmospher is dark and we were told that it was to be an italian diner what ad to the dark side was the art work andi warhol imag of jim jone rasputin christoph mcvey and other icon of evil the headach linger on all day after i paid the bill for 52 for lunch hope they improv the portion the servic and the look i would be hard press to come backmy innerrub is gonna come out here

15 for less than a fistsiz portion of pasta is realli push it the singl baguett slice that came with was insult to injuri i thought pasta was the best food cost to price serv ratio you could do in a restaur i was chide that the pasta was handrol great that mean they touch everi piece

il glad drop dollar for good even decent food but this place made me feel real stupid


edit after read more of the review i may be convinc that the ingredi and labor creat a specialti product that could legitim a high price final call is that smallish peopl may walk away satisfi but averages guy wont be go for your girlfriend then not the nourishworst pasta i have ever eaten im not even kid 

we order the fri buffalo mozzarella pork shoulder  calamari to start  all of it asid from the pork was blah and unimpress the pork was tasti but the flavor was realli strong and i couldnt eat much of it befor want to vomit

for our entre we got the orecchiett alla puttanesca15 which appar has 12 random ingredi from some streetwalk pantri and last time i check a streetwalk is a hooker so i mean if your cool with eat shit from a hooker pantri order this it not good 

we also got the fettuccini tagliatta19 ribey was a littl tough noodl tast funki and me and my palat were overal just veri disinterest in eat more than 2 bite also id like to add that both entre were not hot like they had been sit there for a while this irrit me to no end

not onli was the meal subpar but it was freakin expens honest id rather bust open a packag of safeway brand angel hair and prego from a can  it tast better anyway

sorri pastabar never againif i was come just for the adobo fri rice omelett  think of a burrito chunk of adobo meat in adobo fri rice wrap in an omelett i would give this place 4 star but you would soon forget the adobo fri rice omelett after suffer from the servic my four friend didnt get their food after wait for an hour and one of them just got spam and egg serious an hour for spam and egg what 

i would come back here onli if i call it in for pick up yes  onli for pick up unless you want to faint from hunger the other dish were just ordinari but the adobo fri rice was the best version of adobo i have ever hadastound expens for the qualiti and authenticity

look if youv never been to a countri where gyro are serv out of clapboard cart you wont know what i mean when i say that aint no gyro there are alway ton of peopl stream in and out of this place and a gyro fri and drink is ten buck  for just a total unauthent gyro meat  appar nobodi but me notic and what is up with the pretend tzatziki could you borrow some garlic and dill from someon holi cow

th onli reason this busi get two star is becaus there are no undocu worker nee illeg alien in sightjust high school kid 

blech i tri realli hard to like this place ive eaten there at least a dozen time over the last coupl of year alway the same experienceexcept this last time appar they lost the nozzel to the pepsi dispens in someon drink and one of the high school girl was walk around ask peopl if they were drink pepsi and would they look in the bottom of their cup sighjimmi of yelp find that jimmi of chicago land somewher between 2 and 3 star probabl closer to 3  

jimmi of yelp is give jimmi of chicago 2 star becaus jimmi of yelp feel that jimmi of chicago review are skew higher by 5 star review that jimmi of chicago couldnt possibl have merit  

jimmi of yelp would give jimmi of chicago 25 star if yelp allow jimmi of yelp to give half star but the star decid of yelp are not allow the give of half star by jimmi of yelp

jimmi of yelp feel that by give jimmi of chicago a 2 star review jimmi of yelp is correct the overstat of jimmi of chicago  jimmi of yelp doesnt want innoc yelper show up at jimmi of chicago expect a 45 star experi when they will realist get a 335 star experience

jimmi of yelp found the food at jimmi of chicago to be on the good side of averag the atmospher to be nice and the servic to be veri good

jimmi of yelp thank you for read jimmi review of jimmi of chicagoi realli want to love this place great locat decent price and run by the owner of seamus a spectacular irish bar just down the street

but i cant bring myself to

their server are horrend either they forget order ignor tabl for 1020 and then check back everi 30 second and seem a bit social awkward ive also never seen so mani not attract middleag femal server anywher but applebe in my life

im a big fan of gay or hot femal server they seem to understand the give and take of serv but turf staff doesnt

th place feel like they took seamus threw it into the suburb and made it more famili friend if cocktail yes the tom cruis one sold out and franchis the bar to everi mall around the countri turf is exact what it would look like

anyway their beer select is good and the food is tastiwhoa whoa whoa

i walk into this place fresh shower and smell like rose but walk out smell like greas clog arteri and fat induc mothbal yuck 

i found this countri diner on yelp and was smitten by the world largest omelet sign on their window and review of larg huge and monti python size portion holler i walk in and ask for their world largest omelet which is actual a world record crazi otto broke in year 2002 thus the credit oh i was a bit disappoint ill admit so i ask for the the full size ortega beef omelet 6 egg hash brown biscuit and gravi the biscuit were dri and the gravi was drier the omelet was pretti larg but came with a puddl of greas on top of it the hash brown werehash brown the ortega beef chunk were probabl the best thing about my meal even better was the servic i dont know if he was the manag or what but he told us a littl bit about the histori and origin of crazi otto which serv to be interest and food for thought sothey get 2 star for servic and portions

look i love diner i love huge portion bustl waitress that call you honey and hearti soul food meal that are full of carbohydr but this place was just way too greasi it a wonder how my perfum mix with my hairspray didnt ignit a blaze flame throughout this place with the amount of greas that was in the air seat and food holi smokes

wil i ever go back im all for second chanc but the thought of it just made me throw up a littl in my mouth so the answer is gonna have to be no for now

shivoh gawd anoth shitti chines food place in surpris this place is actual ran by chines peopl but of cours they stick with asian actual american favorit i guess tri and true pay the rent everi month but they should know that differ pay off look at vogu bistro

tri a few lunch special includ kung pao chicken and ma po tofu each came with a soggi spring roll as well as white rice howev if you eat in youll also get a bowl of soup and a salad we did take out the kung pao was kung lame with not much flavor or heat the ma po tofu was bland and didnt have ani of the veggi that the menu promis even the addit of chile past could save this one howev the chicken egg roll are pretti good and manag to stay crispi 

pei wei is still the best surpris has to offer on term of asian food though that isnt say much at alli am on the fenc with this one  while the atmospher is relax and fun who wouldnt like that retro gas station ambianc and the servic was quick and friend the food is not enough to keep me come back for more

th outdoor seat is casual with picnic bench and tabl surround two 70s style gas pump  the set offer a perfect view of the world go by on cave creek road  dog are welcom yay and you will see plenti of furri friend enjoy the day  the interior is small but the space is use well with a few tabl and a small bar which also serv as the counter where order are place  

look forward to big juici burger we chose
big earl burger 575
bleu burger 699
side of onion ring 375
vanilla milkshak 575

the milkshak was by far the best item  thick and creami  howev at a price of 575 i was disappoint to see it came from a machin  the burger were ok  i enjoy the ampl bleu chees on mine but the beef patti were thinner than i expect  the onion ring while inde greasi were not the best i have tri  that award handsdown goe to rocket burger  

on this visit we had a 20 off coupon  the woman who took our order seem a bit confus by the math and we end up onli receiv a 10 discount  shame on me for not catch it earlier as the line when we left was veri long and i did not want to wait to request a correction

al in all big earl is a good place to sit outsid and enjoy the view  mayb with a beer or two but not for the foodso here anoth parallel univers review where the place where we ate had the same address as the place other yelper ate at but our door mustv been mark not so good stuff insid for you 

you may have heard from a friend about this buffet or read the billboard come into vega that what wet my appetit as i was speed into town for a trade show i saw the word best stood out on the billboard alongsid the word buffet and that stuck with me from until wednesday even when  we drove over to the m for dinner

for someon whos visit vega from the late 60s until today i know that vega buffet fight for that best buffet posit in this town what caught me off center was that when i saw the billboard i miss the whole phrase which is best buffet valu not the more direct best buffet which this certain is not howev i do have some posit and point of redempt although minimal

overal the entre item were just ok to subpar the chicken enchilada and chicken tamal sushi chines food item were not much better than fast food level their small offer of middl eastern tabuli hummus and stuf grape leav all had this weird tast  the one item that save it for me was the prime rib and the best area of this buffet has to be the dessert bar they have a gelato area with over 20 flavor but other than that this was sooo bad it honest remind me of food youd find at a homestyl buffet which also remind me of food in a chow hall and my refer go back to thing like midnight chow on the flightlin on guam circa 67 where chip beef on toast was the highlight of the day

just to make sure it wasnt just me i ask the opinion of a friend who live in lv and own a delicatessen oper in town she said theyd tri it and it was in her opinion too horribl we concur it was like eat buik pack frozen entre item youd get from costco the save grace was the staff we found everyon to be veri friend and i did give our server a healthi tip but would i return onli if i want to pay a littl under 25 for unlimit wine beer gelato cake pie and cooki so if youv been do some weed and realli have the munchi for sweet beer and wine this could be your place 

and a footnot about best valu the barona casino in san diego counti has a buffet that about 24 list with discount on the buffet for join their player club you get about 8 off but the differ there is that the food is actual pretti decent when im in vega im not look for a great valu as much as great food so yes i woulda paid more for betterafter much consider i decid my previous rate unfair portray vineri that 3star rate was heavili influenc by ambianc and vision two veri import aspect of a restaur when appli to the food not just the space in which the food is serv im not give up on vineri but rather challeng them to rise abov the mediocr that was appar in our meal trust me i will be back and when vineri has develop it stand in the downtown foodi destin guid ill be proud of how far it come along until then


such a difficult place to review becaus i see so much potenti it a great locat tuck into an awesom neighborhood the interior is intim and has some great cosmet touch i like the idea of have the kitchen behind the counter so you are right there in the action servic is good without the annoy hover and isnt rush so this lend itself nice to a slow meal to enjoy as much as possibl the complimentari sangria is pretti good howev dottsi slap me silli sangria has lift the bar rather high and offer a fourcours monday night meal for 10 is brilliant in ani econom situat plus they have a tapa menu 

and now the ubiquit but 

but egg roll shouldnt collaps on themselv from over fri the slaw was good but the egg roll could have been remov from the fryer sever minut earlier 

but english cucumb are one of my favorit howev they dont have such a long shelf live mix with vineripen tomato is a great idea howev bring some zing with feta chees and a light sprinkl fresh dill and a splash of balsam would realli bring this salad to life perhap im partial to the hummus i make and crazi jim pita bread so ill leav it at that 

but skirt steak should never be use for anyth other than fajita cook fast and hard this is not a good cut of meat to have wrap around a starch possibl fresh asparagusbut leav it in the fajita mix the rice was entir too overseason even for a saltahol like me 

but merchant servic can be just as much your friend as your enemi american use credit card for 1 purchas so certain we would use them for dine out not have a work cc machin put your custom in a veri awkward situat grant there is relat close access to atm and even the circl k but if you have to send your custom away to pay for their meal are you realli accomplish much 

there a reason i front load this review with everyth but the actual foodthi is the part of the puzzl that keep vineri 214 bistro from launch into space and be a stellar dine attract ideal this is a twostar restaur with the emphasi be on potenti abil for now ive decid 25 star is generous and round that up to three ill be back trust me but im hope that the menu is reevalu tweak reinvest and solid deliv in this beauti packag restaurkeep in mind as you read this review that it isnt so much the issu but how it is handledor not handl in this case 

this was communic to barro on april 4 2012 and as of today april 10th i have not spoke to anyon regard this situat  i understand that mistak happen but again it how the mistak is address that can make or break a customer

surpris az location
ord 5730

i just tri call twice and was hung up onc when tri to be put on hold and was on hold for over 5 minut the second time  that probabl lend to my frustrat at this point

i call in an order at 620pm and was told 2025 minut and i show up at 645 and was told my pizza wasnt readi  after wait twenti five minut i went up to the girl and ask her to check on my order  after run around she found it in the warmer and it had been sit there the entir time  she said she was sorri but the order was under linda miller not melinda miller  realli  at what point do you look at the order and realiz it the same person

w actual stop go to barro last summer due to issu just like this and this was some kind of welcom back  we live around the corner and im pretti sure youd agre i shouldnt have to heat up a luke warm pizza i paid for a hot pizza

hop you can use this feedback and get your act togethmanag sour my experi 
typic i love this place but usual eat at egg work my friend prefer it  howev i had purchas a groupon to the crack egg so i need to use it  the catch i accident purchas a groupon that i could onli use monfri  sinc i am alway at work mf it end up expir  if anyon know anyth about groupon it state right on the page that the valu you use to purchas the groupon never expir  so i figur take it in on a sunday at least i would be abl to use the origin amount toward my meal  the server curt told me that they would not accept it  when i ask to see a manag she came over with an attitud and refus to acknowledg my explan or even listen to anyth i want to say  she kept repeat we will not take it  i felt that she was incred rude and will unfortun not return to this locat becaus of her  it is realli unfortun for me becaus the food was absolut delici  probabl one of the better breakfast ive eaten  but i refus to go to a restaur where the manag will not even listen to what i have to say  i also feel that it would not have effect the store if she would have honor the origin groupon price  thank good for me i can still go to egg work  they have alway treat me with respect and smilei was starv and stop by this shop center look for slim sub shop  i was disappoint to see that slim close  i was on a time crunch and saw rosatis

i order 2 slice of chees pizza and want a bottl of waterth girl work the regist told me they were out of bottl water strike 1  

the pizza came out after a few minut  the slice were huge  it was almost the size of a small pizza  i thought that the pizza was aw the sauc tast like can sauc the chees was flavorless and i thought the crust was undercook and rubberi strike 2 3 4  sinc i was starv i ate it anyway except i didnt eat the crustwhich is rare for me i alway eat the crustit was that bad

i know this place is a chain so im not sure i will ever tri it againnot my type of place  i prefer better qualiti pizza

wil i return  no way2 star for good food but crappi servic 

i was rais on indian food and know what i like i heard that tandoori  time was a great restaur so my boyfriend and i decid to eat there a few week back i had been look for a new indian restaur and was excit to tri it out 

 the restaur was busi and we wait about 5 minut until a tabl was avail  we were seat on the patio behind a pillar bad idea our server came over after a few minut to take our drink order  he came back with our drink and we were unsur as to what we want to order for dinner but we order the aloo tikki to start 

the appet took a long time to come out about 20 minut and our server didnt come back to take our order until short befor our appet arriv  we order the bengun bhartha and chicken curri with garlic naan 

anoth 20 or so minut went by after we were finish with our appet befor we saw our server again he set our dish down and ask if we want anyth els i ask if we could have a side of rice becaus i just guess that he had forgotten it or it was on it way as all indian place i have been to serv rice as an accompani to dish 

i told my boyfriend i didnt want to eat my meal without rice so i wait about 10 minut no rice our server continu serv other tabl and walk away befor my boyfriend could flag him down final i decid to not let the alreadi mild cool food get colder so i reluct began eat 

the curri tast great and was well spice  i also love the bengun bhartha i have onli found one place that make it the way i like it 

after we were done eat the two dish the server final came over no rice in hand to ask how our meal was  my boyfriend polit ask for box our rice to go sinc they seem to be still cook it and the check  we wait anoth 5 or so minut to get our bill and the server say dont worri about the rice it on me  what we actual have to pay extra for rice 

mi boyfriend got up and went look for the manag he spoke to the hostess and found out the manag had step away but she call and spoke to him my boyfriend explain our experi and how it was our first time dine there the manag said that we would either wait for him to return or the hostess could take 15 off our bill  not want to wait ani longer for anyth els my boyfriend just ask for the discount 

the food was great but the servic was crap absolut crap unfortun due to that first impress i dont want to go backi have to start with the garlic nan my favorit part of indian cuisin is the nan we ored 2 order of garlic nan and it was burnt not just a littl over cook the whole bottom of each piec was black char burnt complet ruin the meal  the tiki masala and vindaloo were both good but for the pricei can get just as good and bigger portion just about everywher els the price were realli over the top you pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order i did not feel like i had a 50 meal by ani mean and that is what 2 dish one small plate nan rice and one drink cost us we were both just full but had i been with a guy or my step father we would have need more food for 2 

the atmospher is great the place look realli clean the nan was so bad though that it ruin the meal and even if it was perfect i still would have onli given it three star becaus the price are just way more than everywher els i had more reason meal at the best indian cuisin restaur in san francisco

our server was good howev after our small plate she seem a littl put off that we want clean plate for our meal she did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldnt have had to ask with all the sauc on the meal mix them would not have been good and our plate were clear veri dirti after the appetizer

wont be back just not worth the price25  but definit not good enough to bump to 3 stars

just to get to the restaur you must navig through the dreari casino that is fort mcdowel see my review on fort mcdowel  and this restaur is clear an extens of said casino 

let get to the point the onli reason your even consid come heredrumroll
al you can eat crab leg yes it true for 999 you can sit for hour and eat crab leg until you cant can move imo that is the onli reason to come to this restaur or even the casino for that matter the crab leg were plenti and were pretti good these are snow and not king crab leg so they requir a bit of work for the amount of meat you get i ate my weight in crab and did not dare to touch anyth els offer in the buffet the rest of the food enchilada green bean macaroni etc look deplor i get crab is expens and if they must give you someth els to eat in addit to the crab it go to be the cheapest side dish they can call food no thank you  

the real question is all you can eat crab leg worth the visit sigh kinda not realli i dont regret make my 1st visit but at the moment im not compel to return after i was stuf to the gill with crab and had to make the journey back to civil realiti set in the realiti of have to drive 30 mile 10 mile of that through surfac street burn 18th  of a tank in gas and walk thru a casino that is more like a smoki time portal to the reagan era probabl not worth it i could save myself 15 in 91 octan premium petro and just eat at the local red lobster for far better food and a better experihigh on attitudelow on service

bi this point i would have imagin postino would run better then a patek philipp watchthat was not the case last night  

mi suggest give postino central time to hire a servic focus staff with a sens of urgenc befor you come here 

the arriv of postino in my hood was high anticip  i was hope the new central locat would be inspir by postino not an exact replica which was a littl bore  we arriv at 730 to a full bar which a full bar is noth new for this restaur group so whi did it seem so chaotic 

we found some seat at the bar and wait to be serv and wait and wait we count 34 on bar staff yet the main bartend seem preoccupi and easili distract ahad  we were final acknowledg after 10 min and place our order 

 as we look around we notic other at the bar with either an empti drink or no drink at all amaz that the owner was monitor the restaur howev did not pick up on the fact so mani at the bar had to wait so long for servic 

there was one lucki group at the bar  we think they were the origin cast from  the movi sixteen candl   that enjoy except servic and attent full drink at all time maintain the bartend attent as the rest of the patron suffer  perhap they hypnot or use voodoo on the staff hey whatev it take i guess ill go to a graveyard and kill a chicken at midnight befor my next visit 

the bruschetta we order was great the same qualiti as the campbel locat  warm thick slice artisan bread cover with generous amount of top  our favorit were the prosciutto fig and mascarpon chees and the appl  brie yummi  the food was the onli reason i gave this night a 2 star  

although we fought our better judgment to leav after we enjoy  our food we stay  big mistak  we foolish thought  onc jake ryan and carolin mulford left the bar  the voodoo spell would be broken that was not the caseth wait for the follow drink were just as lengthi as the first

if i were the owner  id replac the bar staff with the valet staff the valet staff was quicker servic focus  and had more person then anyon at the bar

i look forward to return back to postino central when they have iron out the kink       sunday brunch buffet       



stop in here to give their buffet a tri  it a small stylish restaur with a big bar kind of a mini version of dos gringo mexigril which also hold a sunday brunch buffet at three valley locat san the crazi sign  the las fuent buffet here it is held sunday until 11am breakfast 11am on brunch  tuesday  thursday even dinner

ther were about 40 food choic out plus condiment  sauc  most of the food was ok but not great  here are a few examples

r good

  the chip  salsa
  the pozolé
  the cold dish of strip of various pepper with fetalik cheese
  the strawberri  cream
  the shrimp fajitas

not so good

  the chilé relleno  nowher as good as at don ruben for instance

  most item werent label  i took what i thought was some carn mechada beef but it was appar birria goat


a stroll duet of mariachi play  sing some music that i would character as surfmex was kind of a nice touch but couldnt make up for the buffet here be way overpr at 1299 when it should have been 799  899 topbuffet of buffet marathon  stop 3 of 7 1200 pm

the 3rd stop in our singl day tour of the buffet of buffet lead us to the imperi palac and the emperor buffet  locat on the 2nd floor abov the casino the buffet is the smallest in size and varieti of the seven  our expect were pretti low so we werent go to fool ourselv into expect ani pleasant surprises

aft brows the buffet line for a while i decid to tri out the dessert  noth on the main buffet line look appeal to me and i want to save a littl room for the other 4 remain buffet  the dessert were okth cake were veri dri  im glad i pass on most of the item here

overal it the lowest rate buffet in the buffet of buffet  will it fill you up  sure  will you feel satisfi  to each their own in my case no  to end on a high note the employe here are friendly

return factor  2great vibe and atmospher local ownedoper use fair trade and in most case organ ingredi  all wins

howev as julia note the servic has drop quit a bit as of late  i was in this morn to purchas a singl cup of coffe to go  the person behind the counter didnt acknowledg my entri there were 2 peopl in the place and i honest wait more than 10 minut for her to complet everyth els she was do befor she ask what she could get for me 

10 minut may not seem like a long time but when you swingin while on your way to work those ten minut seem like an etern  especi when it for a 2 cup of togo coffe she couldv rangmeup and hand me a cup in a minut or less  

and the cooki have gone downhil big time  hard and crispi rather than soft and chewi ick  

not sure if ill be back  i can buy a whole pound of just coffe from willi street for 8 and if i have to wait 10 minut for a singl cup i can spend that time brew it at home just as easily

sorri tuvalu  it tootaloo for me  best wishit been about 2 month sinc i last visit indian curri bowl and im sad to say it is becaus the qualiti of food has serious gone down  back approxim a yearish ago they were so bomb  i thought owner andi was funni as the sarcast grumpi old man  rita wife would come out and ask us how the food was  im sad to read that hes come across as grumpi and condescend and i can definit see whi  

in the last few visit gone now is the consist  no more fantast flavor curri and yes the portion size are get smaller  even the naan come out soggy

conclus  pleas bring back the tasti indian curri bowl that i knew so wellokay i was super excit about this place when i final realiz what it was while we were in the drivethrough  i wasnt excit howev about their complic menu  i did the build your own combo thing and i just want a singl patti cheeseburg with bacon on it  i got the chees curd as a side becaus well how could i not  fri chees  after pull past the pay window we wait for a good 710 minut for our food  that was irrit  i like the whole madetoord thing but jack in the box manag to do it faster  i gobbl up all my chees curd within moment  ya they were realli good  there was a mix of white and yellow chees in there  the flavor of them was just delici  unfortun my burger was all sort of wrong  i open the wrap to find a ridicul misshapen doubl cheeseburg insid  i want one less patti and some bacon   i guess that was too much to ask  anyway it look unappet base off of the strang shape patti and the fact that it was so greasi i couldnt get my hand to grip it without crap fall out the other end  i probabl wouldnt go back unless i was just get a snack  the chees curd are great but that about it1009

had an impromptu breakfast here with a friend  the plan was for me to show him how great a breakfast one could have at the farm at south mountain morn glori cafe but my car overh and lost power at 32nd st and baselin so i ask him if he would pleas find out if down home kitchen is still open for busi  thank  he came back to report that fat daddi down home kitchen is still open but that it was total dead in there  poor fd  i told my friend that i wasnt surpris sinc a few of the peopl i know that have tri fds found the price to be too high for the qualiti of food offer  howev we were hungri and circumst forc us to tri have breakfast here

pricewis my friend couldnt complain  he enjoy his breakfast of scrambl egg with sausag bacon and chees although he did accus me of drag him to an earli grave   he wasnt complain he said sinc he like greasespoon  just sayin is all   seem like hes better at choos the better entre see joe farm grill sinc my biscuit and gravi with extra sausag link grati mani thank to our server who receiv a veri nice tip were among the most undistinct ive ever tast especi after have for two consecut morn the best biscuit and gravi dish at scottsdal daili dose

perhap next time ill just order the failsaf candi yam and brown sugar bake beanfirst to review

i wish someon would have taken the time to save me the trouble

veri small select lacklust at best the fri chicken look yellowwtf

they have seafoodbbqmongolianchinesemexicanoamericanitalian and a 6 item salad barplus a dessert station

th big attract is the mongolian which is made to ordernot for me

i tri a littl of everyth and was pretti disappoint but i fill up on eclair  cheesecake

it beat have to stand in line 2 hrs  green valley ranch but i wouldnt go out of my wayif i am go to spend 759 on yogurt it had better be the best yogurt i have ever tast was this the best yogurt i ever tast no absolut not the soft serv frozen yogurt they use to sell at smitti blow this out of the water

i have been told that this is just a bad locat and that may be true but i assum that they all use the same product and have similar setup it is a franchis after all

i walk in and there were a ton of peopl in there but onli one employe so the line was back up there were no instruct on how this whole doityourself thing work so i just assum you get a cup put some shit in it and you pay one flat rate that  was a 759 mistak i cant afford to be make those type of mistak we are in a recess people

i end up put in a squirt of each of the flavor sinc there was no way to sampl ani of them minus pistachio i cannot stomach the idea the onli one i would consid eat again is the cafe latt one the other were too tart for my liking

i did like the extens top offer but was disappoint with the littl cheesecak bite they dont even tast like cheesecak i want my cheesecak bite to tast like cheesecak is that too much to ask

it probabl doesnt help that i am lactos intoler and that it was so hot outsid that the yogurt melt uber quick and of cours i spill it all over myself i know that none of those thing are direct mojo fault but hey im on a roll 

sorri mojo im just not that into youluci is like one of those annoy slash band you know rockskagregorian chantfus kind of thing  even if there someth you like there all that other stuff to contend with
thi place is a slick bastard child minim of a trader joe meet fresh  easi meet starbuck meet circlek etcetcetc
think of an item you can buy at one of those store add 50100 to the price reduc the select to usual onli one or veri few choic and voila     lucis
everywher i look i saw someth i like temper with someth that made me take a step back  usual it was price  second most often it was selection
then i got to the case with meat and chees and found prepackag excess packagedbtw way to be not green slice of proscuitto or someth similar that were way out of date  6 day past the print use by not sell by date  for a store this small to have more than a half dozen of these packag out in promin view is not okay  at least pull a fe and let the clearanc hound take them for a bargain when theyr about to be past due but dont just keep tri to sell them for full price
they make some fresh lemonad and tea then put them into individu 20 oz32 oz plastic cup and leav them in the fridg case  fine dure a lunch hour rush but for me to have seen a full case of em at 9pmish meant they were about to throw it all away either that or save it for the next day  this is not onli wast of food and plastic packag but also drive their cost up
thi feel like an expens imit of the real deal like an authent ny deli or st loui bbq be drop into kierland common by  pepsicokfcpizzahuttacobel or when a vintag glorifi thrift shop open up in an artsyfartsi or ritzi area and start charg vintag price for stuff they got at goodwil 50 off sale the week before
although im sure that not where luci in get their food  it might not be 699 for a 299 box of cereal if they werei dont get it  whi the good review  ok the marketplac is realli pretti cool but noth too too special  and the menu sound wonder but

aft receiv great servic while order i waitedand waitedand wait for my three egg omelet  i had to final ask about it and when it arriv  ick  brown dri omelet and the potato were like hockey puck  realli pretti bad i thought

disappoint becaus place definit has atmospheri could retel the entir aw experi that happen here but id rather not reliv it and you can just read glenn review instead  in case you dont long stori short is incompet server wear littl cloth cant do anyth right spill ketchup on friend white shirt

i check out the menu for this place onlin and i was super excit there were a lot of thing that sound great  unfortun this is one of those realli irrit place that has a lunch menu and a dinner menu  i end up order the meatloaf sandwich  the meatloaf sandwich was less than satisfi  it was serv open face which was cool but that left the congeal gravi to cool almost instant  the bread underneath was realli tough and hard to eat with the meatloaf  the meatloaf itself was overcook practic blacken and it had pepper in it  i thought it was weird and rather unapp  i dont think mushroom gravi and pepper belong together

servic was just downright aw but i think it was onli the girl we got stuck with  she was rather rude and pretenti  a particular moment in time that stuck out to me was when we comment how heavi the menus were she shot back at us well your not the one carri them all day  sure sweetheart  im pretti sure she is a trust fund babi who is now forc to work her first job ever becaus of the economi  she pick the wrong one  i think there is anoth locat and mayb just mayb we could go back to tri that one  sure the server are a littl more well season that the incompet broad we hadwe came here after go to casavino wineri and read all the great yelp review  typic im in agreement with fellow yelper but this time i feel like they lead me astray  the food was good but not good enough to make up for the terribl servic  they were fair busi although not in a crazi way  when we walk in the owner seem more annoy that she had anoth tabl to deal with than excit to have our busi  we ask for water when we sat down which never came  the food and wine was veri slow to come out and our server didnt come to check on us that often  there were a few time that it felt like they forgot us  there are a ton of great italian restaur out there you may want to skip this onei wish that i knew what i know now 
when i was younger 
i wish that i knew what i know now
when i was stronger  

with ooh la la by ronni wood  ronni lane play in the back of my mind as i am write this review my experi at serendip 3 may have been differ had i order their frozen hot chocol that all the other review seem to have enjoy  unfortun without yelp by our side for the weekend i didnt feel that i need to play 13 for wireless internet when i was on vacat we could onli reli on our waitress  

i wish that i knew what i know now 
when i was younger 
i wish that i knew what i know now
when i was stronger  

we were just there for dessert and i was definit not order their golden opul sunda which was avail for 1000  yes 1000  the golden opul sunda actual hold the guiness world record for most expens dessert  oo  yeah so no we did not order that  

we were recommend their cant say no sunda which was 14  it seem like a good idea at the time compar to the 1k sunda  the sunda cup was glu down to the plate with chocol fudg  it had two banana peanut butter chocol cake two scoop of coffe and vanilla ice cream top with whip cream which was 50 of the sunda and a cherri on top 

i wish that i knew what i know now 
when i was younger 
i wish that i knew what i know now
when i was stronger  

it was definit not worth 14  i could have easili made myself a better sunda than the one that we had  i wish that i knew what i know now  i would have probabl order their frozen hot chocol and probabl would have been a lot happier leav there  not sure if i would return ill consid it but meh  there are just way too mani choic in vega for dessert that im not sure serendip 3 deserv a second chance

i wish that i knew what i know now 
when i was younger 
i wish that i knew what i know now
when i was stronger i had the same exact thought as clair l id rather get a frosti from wendys

not worth the wait i dont even get this whole wait thing when there clear enough space to sit everyon mayb their huge menus are take up space haha

w order a regular which was meant for one person but my friend and i couldnt even finish it felt like a 12 punish ugh there goe my six bucktwo word my wife and i said to each other as we were walk out

nev again

14 for a sunda that was just ok while max brenner is just a walk away  i knew this place was go to be a tourist trap but other want to go regardless of the bad review  id rather buy 3 differ pint of ben and jerri from the supermarketi took my girlfriend and her daughter here on our recent las vega trip i had thought about come here mani time befor but the crowd alway made me decid against it this time the wait was onli 20 minut so we decid just to walk around caesar for a while and give it a try

our food was unremark at best my chorizo quich was cold with one big clump of under season sausag in the middl my girlfriend order the huevo ranchero  the best she could say about them was that they were oknot a ring endors  i cant even rememb what her daughter order but i do rememb her like it but not be over impress by it

i did get the frozen hot chocol which was the highlight of the meal rich and creami with intens chocol flavor if i ever come back i think ill just get dessert and skip the food they are wheelchair access and our server was veri niceso i realli just want to tri the frozen hot chocol want to check out what the hype was about  geez mayb im unfair review this place sinc it is now consid a chain  im not a huge fan of chain  i was so not impress what so ever  our waitress was nice but slow  the food was not good  not good is an understat  my flintston size rib were dri and lack ani flavor of bbq sauc  i had to ask for an addit side and that wasnt good either  i would have prefer heinz in a cup  i bare touch anyth but the cole slaw  the beef in the slider were overcook and dri  the frozen hot chocol was enorm  i took one sip but that about all i could toler  

no restroom in the restaur  you have to walk outsid and down a way to the left under the stair where you will find restroom that are equival to a rest stop bathroom

posit  cool menu and cool space  fortun our time was perfect and we didnt have to wait too long for a seatahso sushi  steak is realli a 25 star rate but onli becaus my son love the show the chef put on at your teppanyaki grill  if it was for my son give you guy prop this would be a 1 star rate 

restaur  yes this place is laid out weird may be it due to the locat  it sort of a triangleish shape with the bar place at the front door the sushi bar away from the regular bar which doesnt make sens and then regular din to fill the triangl with the teppanyaki grill at the far end  i look a littl worn which is surpris sinc this place is fair new

servic  this is where they could use some help it hit and miss depend on where you sit and which server you get my last visit was at the sushi bar and the servic was a complet miss she gave my order to the one sushi chef that was the busiest so i wait and chat with the other two sushi bloke while wait for the first chef to find my order whi not let he pencil someth new but no sir we need to find your origin order so we dont make you two what  i reach for my glass of h2o and my glass was sticki gross i was go to ask for a manag but that when my server appar got lost somewher in the triangl vortex of this place and did not see her again for 15 mins

food  sushi menu is veri plain with onli a few option so i order their  special sushi roll with spici scallop on top of a california roll and some hamachi sashimi  the sashimi was ok it didnt look veri good but there was not fishi smell so i ate it  their sushi roll was crazi funni look it was not cut even at all fell apart and the spici scallop were mushi  yuck i could not eat it  

when we eat their teppanyaki grill it also a hit and miss depend on the cook your get

ov all  meh ive experienc much betteras much as i still love yola for it ambianc and greattast coffe unfortun my last experi there was quit disappoint and felt i need to updat my review 

a friend and i were there on dec 30 around noon we approach the counter to order and were told wed have to wait a few minut no big deal although they do seem to be consist understaf at busier time we order two coffe in mug and were told they were out of mug again not a huge deal but couldnt understand how this could be when they alway default to paper unless a mug is specifi which isnt often sens my disappoint my friend found a use mug and hand it to the barista 

we sat down next to a tabl contain item that previous guest had left behind two coffe cup and use napkin despit a nearbi trash receptacl and dirti dish station whi some peopl cant clean up after themselv is beyond me howev as anoth review point out and becaus this is a consider issu yola need to have sign remind peopl to return use dish and dispos their trash 

and so we wait and wait and wait some more it was a good 30 minut befor our coffe arriv i took a sip and it was obvious my latt was not made correct requir a return trip to the servic counter similar error have occur on past visit make me question their orderfulfil system my companion and i linger for a coupl hour talk and drink we were approach at 2pm with an announc that they would be close at 230 what i ask whi and was told oh just becaus of the holiday and everyth ummm what holiday mind you there was no sign on the door or counter area indic the earli close time and there were sever confus custom still in the shop thank we had finish our coffe but we left baffl and unhappy

although yola is still a nice cozi place for coffeebreakfastlunch i think they need to work on a few thing to improv servic and the overal enjoy of their guest if the owner are read i would also suggest instal blind or shade on the larg expans of southfac window it almost imposs to sit near the window on a sunni day unless you like be blind it also get veri hot last 430 is kind of an odd close time stay open until at least 5 or 6pm seem more reason and custom wouldnt feel so rushcame here last night to meetup with a larg group of peopl to watch the usc vs hawaii game on the patio  our group made arrang to have the patio to ourselv dure the game

 been here onc befor and didnt like it but came here anyway becaus of the group get togeth  the servic all night long was atroci  here the breakdown

our server gave my tabl a menu but fail to mention that even though it wasnt happi hour you could still order from the happi hour menu but pay full price for the item  after brows the menu for a minut i thought i overheard someon at the tabl next to us order nachosi scour the menu look for them but didnt find itso i assum that i was hear thing and we proceed to order a pepperoni pizza and a mushroom lover pizza

whil we were wait for our food our glass of wine  beer went emptythen our water glass went empti  we had to flag down the waitress to fill them up each timethi went on throughout the night  they brought out the pepperoni pizza and we start to devour itthink the mushroom pizza was still be prepar i didnt ask about it at the time  meanwhil a huge plate of nacho get deliv to the tabl next to uswhat the hell  

then anoth tabl next to us get nacho too  so i ask our serverwher is nacho on the menush say it on the happi hour menu sinc it isnt happi hour they are 9 do you want to order onei say well if we didnt alreadi order a mushroom pizza and pepperoni pizza i would have order nachossh say what mushroom pizza  all i have is a pepperoni pizza for younow im pissedi told her to put in the order for mushroom pizza  i ask how they knew about the happi hour menu and she said that they ask for itthat crazyhow are peopl suppos to know to ask about someth they are unawar of

th 2nd pizza came out after a while but what a disast for servic all night 

the pizza was goodnot great  the pepperoni didnt have enough flavor  the mushroom pizza was far from a mushroom lover pizzaveri few mushroom  i expect more mushroom  i would have rate the food 3 stars

wil i return  unfortun it look like our group want to meet here for game all year long so if i want to hang out with them ill return  next time ill eat befor i arriva confus unwelcom place panini impli italian they have menu item call pita and gyro on the menu impli mediterranean but the food and staff are eastern european 

i final stop in for a lunch today after pass the place daili for the last year or so it has been open i order the beef pita which is inde beef but noth resembl ani sort of a pita it was huge for one thing about 10 x 6 and appear to be a coil sausagefil tube of phyllo the fill was a mild season meat noth offens but noth great the phyllo was most flaki and in some place soggi and the whole thing pretti darn greasi i made it though about 13 of it befor it was all too much next time i cross the ural on foot id like to have a few along but way too larg and heavi for a phoenix afternoon 

other menu item were sever other pita like spinach and feta some gyro which from the pictur on the menu appear to be more like sandwich and a few salad fresh bake loav of white bread and roll were also display on a shelf for sale 

the atmospher is not exact welcom there are a coupl outdoor tabl which today like most day i pass by were occupi by smoke men with heavi accent walk up too the door the look they gave me posit shout you are not one of us whi are you here and made me wonder is this place realli open to the public am i confus  but the woman who serv me was smile although hello was the onli pleasantri i receiv no inquiri about was this my first time in how did i find out about them onli two tabl are locat insid one of which was occupi and one of which had food spill all over it consid the unfriend hulk at the outsid tabl it a good thing i had plan on takeout 

no enjoy your lunch or come again and more glare from the unfriend outsid when i left i had plan to come back and tri a few other thing but id rather go somewher els that seem to actual want me thereive given this place 3 trys bacon struck out 3 time you know what they sayit 3 strike and yoouuuurrre out 

everi time the kitchen is super slow and everi time someth was wrong with the order one late sunday we 2 ppl wait 45 minut for our food the restaur was not even busi at this hour i was starv wait on top of that the server suck two out of my three experi includ sucki servic they dont know the menu they forget stuff get the order wrong neglect youetc

to make it wors the food simpli isnt all that great and definit not creativ you know those place where the food is so damn good ie breakfast club that the long wait is worth it or an overwhelm server is forgiven yeah but not the case here they realli need to step up their game especi in this economi 

omg i almost forgot to mention their incred overpr alcohol beverag 

the locat is great has a ton of potenti onli if they revamp the servic and the foodso what is the dealio with frotang
it a question that keep me up at night ponderingpondering
i need an answer so when i got out of the offic and went for a walkabout in old town for lunch a coupl of day ago my rout took me past the frotang palac in old town ice tango
i thought as i made my fate decis to walk in frozen yogurthow difficult can this be
plenti difficult as it turn out
i was greet by the guy who lost on american idol appar mayb a dead ringer as i walk in 
he point to the 10 row of soft serv machin and said you can tri ani flavor you want and indic a stack of exquisit tini paper thimbl in which i was suppos to put a small serv of frotang to tri out
i had no idea what the frotang was go to tast like so thought good ideai could not have been more wrong
i approach the first soft serv udder with a label that said someth like creami tangfro and gave it a short pull
2 12 cup of creami tangfro cascad over the side of my thimbl and onto my hand desper cup to keep the yotang from hit the floor and mark me as a nonpro tangfro jockey
i didnt realli get a tast as i dump the thimbl and the extra 2 lbs of yofro in the trash bin
whil unsuccess tri to clean my sticki hand with a wad of napkin i decid on anoth approach
i walk by the 30 differ soft serv machin look at labl in a hopeless attempt to find my standbyvanillano go for vanilla froyo
i did find some sort of chocol blend but it was in one of the 6 or so soft serv udder that were not in work order swirl cold but the udder just wouldnt  give
i final settl on mangi tango or was it tangi mango and coconut someth combo
i got a small cup and by now well awar of the awesom dispens capabl of these hard core soft server i pull the lever on the combo udder for 1 second1 second
mi littl cup was onli 13 full just right 
i ad a spoon of strawberri to the concoct and took my prize to the counter to pay for it
adam probabl not his real name motion that i should set my tangi treat on the scaleh was go to weigh it and i was go to pay 38 per ounc for my sweet confect 
good deal i didnt have that mani ozs
427 
adam do you want to weigh that again 
are you kid 
who do you guy think you aresprinkles
i ask adam how they hide the ballast in the cup 
adam look at me like im not all that funnybut i am
i would tell you that i have never had better froyotang but i had never had ani of the stuff before
th mangi tango part was ok but the oilcan coconut had a chemic tast and i toss about 349 worth of tangyo into the trash
so no bro on the fro yo from the tangoa miss opportun  

i was excit that the lgo heritag was go to invad my hood again big mistak tonight was a disappoint  i encourag my friend to join me at gallo to see what new and excit thing are  be offer by doug  robson of lgo fame here are gallo  yawn

first lemm say i felt the staff was great grant there were onli 20 peopl in the entir restaurantour server was attent and visibl   

i review the menu prior to arriv so i gentl advis my bud that it not a full servic restaur  per sea  but more of a snack stop   we arriv and were quick seat we order the guacamol as an appet which we all enjoy  the  guac  arriv with a pair of enhanc sauc which appeal to all  the chip for dip were extrem light and flavor the highlight of the meal in my opinion

us caution and stick to just taco the three of us order a mix of all of the taco and one order the cheeseburg    the taco arriv prompt after the appet the taco neat present in an accordion type metal rack although aesthet pleas the rack was not warm so it basic stole the heat from the taco  thank god it did not steal the flavor whichi have to say was veri nice not fantast but veri good  the pork was great nice and juici with a somewhat sweet tang the carn asada were perfect in my opinion the veget taco veri flavor consid it was just veggi    my bud who order the hamburg was realli disappoint he claim it not cook accord to his request medium but veri rare  he did give kudo for present but that was about it  

would i come here again perhap but not to bring a first date or impress my boss i might howev come here after a heavi night of drink when the tummi is grumbl  im hope that doug will shine in a few month and present a new menu with integr and virtu 

i am kinda perplex  by all the great review of gallo mani of the yelper have given this restaur overwhelm great review my questioni whicall me a hater but you all are brainwash 

edit chang my review to two star to be a littl more fair

i will start off by say this is by far the best restaur the clarendon has had yet though that isnt say much consid their track record the place is veri unassum and actual has a veri comfort feel we were absolut confus where to go when we walk into the restaur you cant tell where the bar end and the dine room begin and they dont have a set up hostess stand the one they have is in the middl of the room which you can easili find our hostess look at us odd for a coupl of second befor i let her know were here for dinner

aft be seat our server came over and we told her it was our first time and need her help choos she describ everyth to sound absolut delici so we order away i start out with the picolo a drink made with jalapeno tequila lime and muddl season fruit sound delici but this is where the night took a turn for the worst i took a tast and just about drop my glass and my head twitch it was so tart it was undrink im a guy who like my sour candi and sour anyth but this was almost pain to drink i told the server and she start laugh and appar assum i was kid 

i order three taco and a side of rice i first tri the cochinita which i have to say was an absolut butcher dish doe this white boy need to go over and give lesson to you peopl about how to proper cook a mexican dish you do not put guacamol on cochinita pibil you also dont use tough chop pork you use shred and slow roast pork you dont put chunk of fruit in it either you ruin one of the greatest mexican dish of all time the carn asada had a wonder textur and tender qualiti but fell flat on it face when it came to flavor of which it had none i tri the ahi tuna taco as well which also was cover in guacamol you cant just cover all of your food in guacamol and pass it as mexican unless you are tri to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen i ate my guaco not taco begrudg 

mi girlfriend order the guacamol and proclaim it to be complet averag but id have to say otherwis i took a bite on a chip onli to find a big chunk of orang slice realli peopl order this and then come back and order it again this is actual the second mexican dish youv manag to butcher after the cochinita pibil i wont even start on the rice which was not cook proper was cover in cilantro and i mean cover and was borderlin cold 

servic here is good enough but i had the feel the whole time that our server was simpli go through the motion when she laugh and told me she was glad i like the drink i was complain about all the way to the end when she ask whi we didnt finish the guacamol and couldnt understand whi we werent lick the bowl she just flat out was off 

the meal was absolut a bastard of the mexican cuisin you all are tri to damn hard to be cute and made yourself look like inexperienc buffoon in the kitchen i have to tell you that this place is probabl onli surviv becaus it cater to a nich and becaus some yelp superstar decid they like it and all their sheep friend follow if this place had to surviv on it own in the real world outsid it im to hip to go anywher that cool peopl wont see me atmospher it would fall flat on it face just like everi other restaur this hotel has dreamt up918

98 south is open for busi again  when did this happen

i decid to tri the mojito while my friend order a miller light  the bartend with big blond hair and a veri ampl um counten hand me my drink after a few minut and had to ask what my pal was have again  while she retriev his bottl from the fridg i tri the mojito  i wish i hadnt  it was veri heavi on the mint syrup  im use to drink made w muddl fresh mint but if she had use a light hand on the syrup i probabl wouldnt have mind  i had ask if shed redo the drink and she said sure but not wout show her dissatisfact  she return w two glass the revis drink and leftov from the origin should i want to have more alcohol  as she hand him his beer he gave her his credit card to which she shout back a what do you want to do with this  he was so taken aback he had repeat the question and almost retort back an apt respons but decid against it just to help speed the transact along  

im just glad that my companion enjoy the jazz accompani bec i felt so bad he had to pay 12 for that terribl mojito drink which he had me abandon after take a photo of it  lesson learn just like with food menu select i should find out how they prepar their drink  i realli did think that a nice place like this wouldnt cut corner and use such saccharinsweet syrups

d  our bartend name is iolandajoey joey joey 

i brought the fam here to enjoy a nice burger and well i was disappoint 

mi 23lb burger was not the fat thick burger as i onc had it is now 2x 13rd patti not even close no flavor at all  
as an owner point out they have alway use 2x 13rd patti mayb i was look for the 12lb either way it was a hand partti and one thick patti not thin one 

the onion ring were bore the frys were bore the chicken nugget were bore the fish was good and tarter sauc was great 

too much bore and too much money i think joey out grew themselvthis bakeri has been here a while now i did not stop in until a coupl of day ago 

i can not speak on the deli aspect of it i did not get ani meat 

i did howev ask for one item that in on the menu i was told this is a special order item well then state it as such so i got a poppi seed someth or other it was dough with poppi seed shape in to a roll one person size lemon cake and an eclair the poppi seed doohickey had no flavour i mean noth the eclair was pretti bland and tast as less than stellar ingredi were use the lemon cake was so bad it was trash can after one bite 

so i can honest say i have had better arizona has a hard time with good bakeri 

the bakeri it self felt border on depress i could not stay there for longit seem that they open and were pretti consist with the prepar of their food for about a month in recent time the sandwich name their hangov burgerchicken capres have been serv soggi happen everi time their buffalo chicken sandwich is undersauc half of the time  their soon to be famous chicken wing tast as though they were made in the microwav go to jts for alreadi famous wings

onward to the clientel i live in the neighborhood and know that it come with the territori but white dude with golf sunburn ton of botox 2030 someth douch there also too much go on kid corner with video game famili diningbar area laden with jersey and pic of the hood convert to gold fish race vomit in adjac park lot poor judgment hookup postfrat bar

now im not say that all of the abov is bad it just that there too much go on it lack direct or the lack there of

oh and i hate the valet thing that happen in this part of town

oh and dont park in the jts lot unless your go to jtscant say im a fan grow up ive been to my share of sizzler and this place has a sizzlerish vibe to it just not as good and lack cheesi bread it even taken up resid in an old sizzler

w got the soup and salad bar the ingredi werent fantast i saw wilt lettuc on the line which i found unappet as well as chees sauc cover with a layer of goop that was also pretti gross look 

i stuck with chicken wing and some of the other salad offer their soup offer were lack just navi bean and french onion on this particular occas 

the servic was pretti slow i wait for long period tri to get their attent to get refil and new plate 

overal noth i couldnt get in a casino edr and definit noth i would want to pay for not sure about their menu item sinc i havent had tri ani of them but i cant say ill be back to do so anytim soonpleas someon tell me what i am miss here 

mi famili love italian food love love love it be super carb sensit i think about carb and i gain 5 lbs eat italian is the bane of my exist for this veri reason

th premis is nice a famili run italian deli i can dig that we enter were instant greet i check in on yelp the elit thang to do and perus the menu i was shock at the price a simpl pasta dish was 1499 for pasta  none of their dish came with soup or salad to justifi the high cost 

anyway my famili order fresh bake bread arriv pipe hot crispi on the outsid soft in the middl i had onc slice and savor it this was the best part of the meal we each had order a cup of soup 70 degre weather in late may justifi as cool enough for soup in my book they were all  homemad and they were all aw my pasta e fagoli was noth but a weird broth white bean and pasta the minestron was veget soup with pasta the chicken soup was hope but it didnt have ani real flavor each cup of soup was an addit 5 decent size cup but when the flavor is lackluster

next come our entre the stuf pepper was the onli tasti thing order a bit salti but had a rich complex in flavor profil and textur i order the four chees risotto it was far too salti and thank my mama put some of her yummi stuf pepper sauc into my dish and it perk it up a bit the risotto was cook a littl too short it was not to the point of al dent which to my knowledg is how all noodl in italian restaur are serv the other dish order was the bake rigatoni pasta greasi meat sauc and a layer of chees ekk  i tri a bit of it and i swear this am after brush my teeth last night and again this am i still feel a thin layer of greas on the roof on my mouth okay im be dramat these dish all rang from 1499 to 1899 i dont understand pasta tomato and buy bulk chees isnt that expens all of the food was wrap up and taken to go again portion are huge but when the food doesnt tast good it just even more of a waste

servic was great attent inform so kudo there howev 90 for 3 peopl to eat at an italian deli is ludicr in my mind especi when i would rather eat at oliv garden and it would have been far more satisfi and lighter on the wallet the restaur was also veri loud the high ceil and the absenc of a wall in the dine area amplifi nois level i feel like i was rob eat here i ate carb for you roma carb and i gain about 20 lbs while write this review becaus of all the think and write about carbi want to go somewher ive never been befor gallo blanco or the parlor i read great thing about both place but i decid on the parlor walk in this place made me think of the vig becaus the decor is veri similar  the food and drink menu look great  i was realli hungri and start out with the bruschetta and a watermelon agua the drink was light and refresh not too sweet and you can tell that they use fresh watermelon juic instead of that pucker crap the bruschetta mix had a sweet tast to it that i didnt like but noth that salt and pepper couldnt fix my sister order the grinder and i order the pepperoni pizza becaus our waiter suggest it i took a bite out of my sister sandwich and it was veri plain but the french fri were awesom my pepperoni pizza was greasi and burnt i wasnt impress the parlor didnt live up to it hype and everyth here look great but doesnt delivi can onli start off with say ehh  the parlor is cool look and the interior put off a good vibe  beyond that i am not sure i will ever feel the need to go back  i met friend for a late night drink on a friday mayb 10pm and the place was dead  thought that was weird  my second trip i tri some food  i had been crave a salad and found one i like on the menu  so when i was order off of it the server told me it is the late night menu now  whi was i given the full menu then  luckili the salad was on it  the salad was good but i think that was the last time we saw the server  he seem to be hate everything

overal ok experi but noth to write home about  my buddi had a pizza and later told me it was not so greatprobabl 25 stars

i usual do not factor in price to my review  i tri to concentr on the experi itself and give a rate base on that alon  i do that becaus i alway am awar of the cost of my dine experi and am will to pay for what i get  howev in the case of bar masa i had such a case of sticker shock that i had to factor it in  i stop in late one night after a poker tournament and order some sushi salmon eel and hamachi

when my order arriv it was one small piec of each for 800 each  they were all veri good but i was still hungri so i order the special mushroom roll it was one of the best roll i have ever had  thin sear beef outsid and a mix of exot mushroom inside

mi food was good but at almost 80 for three piec of sushi one roll and one small caraf of sake it should have been amaz anoth thing that bother me is that even though this is a sushi restaur there is no sushi bar  as a frequent solo diner i  like be abl to sit at the bar and interact with other custom and the chef

servic was prompt and profession but rather stiff and stuffi  they are a brand new restaur so they are obvious wheelchair access sinc bar charli is close i was hope bar masa could match it in term of qualiti and valu  unfortun my experi did not reach that levelthis review pertain to the summer tast menu

th skinni surpris weak in the flavour depart poor execut and lack of a clear thought process make this place a nogo 25 servic is quit good in the restaur 4 valu given the qualiti 42 per person is pretti ridicul 1

we were origin go to hit up american fish for their happi hour but unfortun they were close we stop by sirio due to their appeal summer menu offerings

mi husband and i both order the summer menu which consist of beef carpaccio mix green salad with goat chees appl and candi hazelnut mushroom ravioli and the roast chicken with asparagus artichok and mushrooms

th beef carpaccio aka where the beef carpaccio was overwhelm with arugula caper and chees  not much beef on the plate the beef lack adequ season and was surpris dri the dish realli need more of the citrus oil to moisten the meat and add flavour

th mix green salad was astound bland given the number of ingredi the appl in the dish was tasteless as if dunk in water for too long the champagn vinaigrett was indiscern goat chees had no goati in a good kind of way or even saltinessth onli thing in that dish that impart some sort of tast were the love scatter of candi hazelnuts

ravioli in my mind was more than al dent  it was definit undercook the fill which was suppos to have mushroom in it was overwhelm by the thyme insid and had no mushroom flavour whatsoever

albeit the skin of the chicken was nice and crispi the breast was dri and over salti the lemon in the glaze did not work well with the wine reduct use in the sauc the sauc was unpleas odd and overwhelm the veget you couldnt tast the mushroom asparagus and artichok it was a veri unsuccess dish

fin dessert i look for redempt on the last cours of panna cotta and gelatosorbetto select what i found was the complet lack of thought in these dishes

th panna cotta was okay  perhap a littl too much on the gelatin side but fine when serv over the berri soup the sweet of the panna cotta made the berri soup over sour 

the same thing happen with the gelato and sorbetto they serv vanilla bean gelato with two sorbet  passionfruit and peach when you took a bite of gelato then tast the sorbet your mouth pucker like you empti a bag of sour kid in there individu each ice cream was okayit just the combin made no sens there was obvious veri littl consider put into compos this dish  a recur theme at the restaurant

given the poor qualiti and exorbit price this place rate a 2one of the best look cafe in vega locat in the newest casino on the strip unfortun for a cafe with a limit menu it seem to be overpr for averag food  

for the price of the openfac philli cheesesteak sandwich it wasnt worth it  definit had better elsewher for much cheaper
th chillaquill didnt look or tast like it should  the textur was soggi and the flavor was dri  the complimentari bread with cream cheesetastin butter was better  
at this point my cousin just couldnt wait to walk off the disappointment
th blt howev was satisfactori with thick slice of smoke applewood bacon arugula and tasti basil sauce

if it wasnt for the blt i wouldv given a one star rate onli for the attract decor and new vibe of this placewas told that this buffet was suppos to rival that of wynn and bellagio so i had high hope go in it was gourmet dinner night which was 3899 so my friend i decid to go back downstair and gambl a littl and come right befor they did their lunchdinn swaplunch1999  upon enter you see the seafood select and got giddi it loook amaz oyster raw clam huge shrimpwynn doesnt even serv shrimp at lunch anymor crableg etc  walk around and saw prime rib   leg of lamb and all tht good stuff i figur heck this is just the normal lunch i should wait till they chang it up for gourmet dinner so from 345430 i made a huge mistak selfish i guess i onli had me a plate of seafood think by the time i was done everyth woul be swap so while i wait i realiz that everyh here onli look nice and look can be deciev the oyster and clam were unfresh and had that veri unpleas seafood tast the sashimi was slice paper thin unlik bellagio generous portion thing start to go downhil from there i got up to get a slice of prime rib and wth they took it away and replac it with 2 turkey the leg of lamb was gone and replac by skirt steak reallli realli overcook and tough skirt steak  even though he said he was give me the more rare piec  i walk around the buffet to see what els had chang from normal lunch to  gourmet dinner and was supris to see that everyth pretti much stay the same i néed to stop my rant now im still at aria but figur i should do my yelp duti and warn other of this overyhyp overpr buffet i mean 1999 isnt bad but dont spend almost 40 for dinner your pretti much get the same food you would have gotten at mgm at doubl the price  if you want buffet  go to wynn or bellagio or you can get yourself a pretti decent dinner at a nice restaur elsewherhow mani nice restaur are there in las vega on the strip alon  a lot  how mani did we eat at  zero  thank to my husband inabl to wait 5 minut onc hes hungri and our friend who would rather spend their cash on beverag rather than food

so aria buffet was our friday night dinner  with unlimit wine and a lobster for everi two peopl 36 sound like a pretti good deal  unfortun sinc we never made it back to our hotel room the night befor i was not at my best for eating

th buffet had just about everyth  multipl carv station that includ lamb turkey new york steak pork tenderloin and prime rib  i had none of that so i cant comment other than to say my companion were pleas  seafood option includ crab leg shrimp and oyster among other thing  

the free lobster was a mess  our order was lost so there was a long delay and it was not worth the wait  it was so overcook it was like chew on a piec of rubber  minus two star alon for the senseless slaughter of crustacean  if you cant prepar it well enough to at least be edibl dont bother offer itariaoh sweet aria i love my room and the entir properti howev your buffet was a dud

i had high hope after wait an hour in line 

mediocr at best small select of oddbal food options

noth stood out except the dessert macaroon the dessert section is good howev not enough to warrant a repeat visit word of mouth is import and the word that will be come out of my mouth regard this buffet are not good 

is not a good sign when the one memor item is a freakin macaroon cooki for shame

no second chanc will be issu i am one and done

food was cold that was a huge issue

dont wast your time

go to the m resortstudio b buffetnow that is a buffet worth talk aboutthe one redeem qualiti of this store is that some of their tea are quit good if you are an earl gray fan the earl gray creme make a nice divers from an everyday earl gray the earl gray white is pretti good as well the qualiti of their tea is middl at best and they have an overabund of fruiti blend that wont appeal to most serious tea drinkers

th store itself is obnoxi they have hawker out front tri to lure passersbi into get sampl of tea which is annoy in and of itself to the point that i go out of my way not to walk by their store onc you get insid they are veri aggress about sell you larg quantiti of tea in overpr contain the rest of their merchandis is overpr as wellif you are look for ani kind of kettl tea mug or other accessori shop around befor you pay teavana price as other have note make sure you pay close attent to how much tea they are ring up and request a regular bag unless you want to be charg for the contain you do not need a pound of tea unless you are a fanat tea drinker go through 1012 cup a day 6 ounc of tea is plenti for almost anyonsorri  kid it close  it soooo sad they were bare open quit possibl the worst breakfast burrito ive ever had not onli was it gross but they charg extra for bacon and chees so for 15 you get a greasi tortilla fill with scrambl egg bacon and chees product oh and a gracious help of sour cream on top bleh

servic was fine  my waiter was perfect pleasant but the price and qualiti were pretti offensive

mayb id come back for a margarita or chip and salsa def not for breakfastthis was one of those place that i want to like just for the mere fact that they are sort of a cornerston of the downtown glendal scene i want to like this place so much that i didnt write this review base on one visit nor two but three strike your out

ther isnt much that bitze mama doe well in fact the onli redeem trait might be the salsa but even that isnt enough to bring me back of my own fruition the servic is omg  i can feel my hair grow slow the food is noth memor  if you even get what you order onc i order a cheesesteak and i just got the chees  i kid you not no meat the price are actual high for what you get  and check your bill becaus onc i was charg 4738 for a soda and sammi which i actual had to argu about with the manag i was pretti sure i could take her but dang that just not right

mama may have been a stapl in the past but her age is show and she desper need a calgon momentone day we decid to make the drive out to maricopa to check out the harrah casino  when we arriv we were hungri and decid to give their buffet a tri  we were realli disappointed

th select of food was not veri good  the best item was the ice cream and dessertswhich were averag at best

it was one of those meal where you got mad at yourself for wast calori on bland food  oh well

on good thing is that the cashier at the buffet told us wed get a discount for sign up for a player club card  we did and got a good discount unfortun the food wasnt worthwhile

atmosphereservice
just when the food is bad here come the waitstaff who are not quit bright in the head you go in you sit down and they do not attend to you quick you would think after repeat attempt to waiv your hand in the air i rare do this it a necessari evil that they would see you they dont they must have some kind of ray charl syndrom or stevi wonder can you name anoth blind person style syndrom messag me with one and i can add it becaus that would be what the waitstaff must have actual the blind are upstand citizen with amaz sens they would probabl do a better job henc i feel bad bring them up oh well anyway 

extrasrating
you might be surpris they get even two starsand heck they realli do not deserv them i give them one star for the locat and anoth for still after all the bad experi not be the worst bar ive attend to this point congrat to that they are more worthi of 1 12 star but whi not i have piti on this spotso two it is just stick with me on this one and stay away guy leav this place for the drunk there are so mani better option in this center i mean seriousi came here for the first time ever today to pick up a coupl of cake pop as a surpris for my sweet pea  while they had lot of cupcak to choos from no flavor realli caught my eye there were onli four choic of cake pop  one was mint which i dont care for in desert and the other were browni cotton candi and a coconut which i got for myself

al the cake pop had veri thin coat which crack and flake off befor i even got them home  the coconut had a nice moist center veri sweet but that the natur of a cake pop and a sprinkl of coconut on the outsid  the browni was gummi and over dens and the cotton candi flavor was just disgust  

though mind over batter is close by i dont think well be tri them again  our search for a good cake pop continucupcak are decent so that is not the issu  i bought a groupon which was 10 for 20 worth of product  cupcak cost 315 each so i order 6  do the math and it less than 20  when i hand my groupon to the cashier she said oh you get 7 cupcak with this groupon   ok i pick a 7th cupcak which didnt fit in the box so she tip it sideway in a styrofoam cup and put it in a separ bag   then she rang up my purchas and said i owe her 2310  i said well take off the 7th cupcak becaus i onli want to use my groupon  she said i had to hit the 20 mark to use this groupon  so buyer bewar  your groupon is not 10 for 20 worth of product  there is a 310 upcharg when you get to the store  i was with my kid and didnt wish to disappoint them so i paid the addit 30 upcharg and took my just okay cupcak and left  i will not be back  not becaus the cupcak arent ok as they are decent  i will not be back becaus of the scam at the cash regist  by the way it was done with such practic that i am will to bet it been done to everi singl groupon custom who came in befor me  bewari had a groupon and was excit to tri a new cupcak place  im a cupcak snob true stori  the reason is becaus i have been spoil with georgetown cupcak from live in dc for year so everyon get compar to them  i read that mind over batter won an award for their red velvet cupcak and knew i need to tri it  the verdictmeh  it tast ok not amaz  the first thing i notic was that the cake was a bit dri and the frost had so much sugar in it that halfway through the cupcak my teeth hurt and i end up scrape the rest off  ive been back onc sinc my first visit and the qualiti had gone downhil  also they rais their price and a dozen of cupcak is now more expens than a dozen from georgetown cupcak and they will ship anywher in the us  i dont think the qualiti at mind over batter is commensur with the pricesky bar  violet candi and naughti soda drinks

naughti soda i am not much of a soda drinkeri quit all the caramel colour soda in 3rd grade cold turkey and never look back but i do have an extrem soft spot for root beer orang grape and other novelti flavour especi stewart brand back on the east coast we had lil drive through that serv black cow which is a root beer float but stewart root beer is a masterpiec virgil is creami and spicey hansen has a real licoric tast dr brown is anis tasti but onli stewart get my vote everi time they had that one cream soda orang n cream lime rickey jone soda virgil and way too mani other brandsflavor to count truli a refresh way to cool down while perus the strip httpwwwdrinkstewartscom

could it be i am not much of a novelti girl

hmmmviolet flavour soda fill in a sky bari came here not too long ago to get a quick takeaway bite befor head to school 

it took me some time to figur out what i was go to buy i was quit indecis i want to get the freshest tastiest look wrap possibl to start my studi day off right 

on the shelf there werent too mani option but among them there were a coupl that look quit stale and one be outofd i hand it back to the ladi at the till then proceed to choos i went for the spici bean wrap 

i was cross my finger that id be abl to handl the amount of spice yaneverknowright and opt for this i rememb it be around the region of 295 took it away and hop on the bus when i final had my first opportun to take a nice bite i found out the wrap was spiceless 

now when i say spiceless i mean 1 no spicy 2 no flavour i paid 3 pound for essenti a wrap with black bean in it no salsa not much els oh and they said there was chees in it what chees so disappoint 

now i dont know whether henderson is one of those place that poor repres veganvegetarian food to be bland and tasteless but i was disappoint it was a veri poor wrap  

i like vegetarian food henderson you gotta repres better your gonna give vege food a bad rep manbland  bore but cheap 999 per person

smallest buffet i have ever seen veri limit selectiondessert select is the worst

noth specialth pictur tell it all

servic was fast  friend but didnt make up for the food

i wont be back unless it freeive been think to tri this place for awhil but was not terribl impress with their websit or menu select  on word of mouth i decid to tri it anyway  it is a love space nautic theme cape cod inspir but doesnt realli make sens given the menu seem french inspir  

we went for the sunday brunch were seat prompt and the wait staff were attent and friend  that was the best part but staff cant make up for mediocr food  i order a mix green salad and a savori crepe the waiter prompt return to let me know my main dish came with a salad and he would cancel my salad order  like i said the servic was not a problem  my main cours was good not great the crepe was well done but the dish was not balanc it lack the special someth that make a meal great  i was plan on give garfield 3star until

it was my anniversari so we splurg with desert  one of my favorit was on the menu tart tartan  it was not good  if you are familar with the dessert it has a crisp pastri crust with thin slice appl and has a scope of ice cream  their version had huge chunk of appl and was drench in some kind of honey sauc so the pastri was soggi and the whole dessert was sick sweet  

mi husband and i also had two mimosa each and our final bill was over 90  not that we are cheap diner but for that much we would like to be blown away or at least have a decent meal  my husband didnt enjoy his meal either but ill let him tell his own story

suggest to garfields
1  add your time of busi on your website
2  replac huge portion with better qualiti  or just make your portion smaller and charg less
3  pick a style and stick with it  i was veri confus as to what style of food or theme your restaur has  cape cod  english french fusion  im just not sure
4  includ better descript on your menu  we we were veri unclear what side went with entre  if you advertis tart tartan but includ your own twist from the tradit then you need to state that2 star would have been 4 if the servic was at least decent  hard to justifi wait 25 minut befor someon came and talk to us after we were seated

w came here after hike picacho so we were too tire to leav but this is shame bad  food qualiti was actual pretti good better than the chandler mimi but after the drink came and food order was taken it was anoth 25 minut befor the food came  

refil were slow the ladi who help us tri to smile and apolog but she was certain quick to drop the check off when we bare finish eat  so
25 min wait for drink order
25 min wait for food order
30 min to eat
check was not late came right as soon as she took the first few plate off

oh and we did not go dure rush hour we were there at 2pm  all in we got out of this place at 10 till 4  not impress and kind of shock that a nation chain could be so bad  if anyon from mimi corpor is read just send someon over there and pretend to be a late lunch client on saturday guarante a veri full reportive been to rosco and now ive been to lolo let compare

location
rosco are typic found downtown la or in a ghetto this lolo is found in a phoenix suburb edg lolos

parking
 been to three rosco and the park situat is alway a dinki littl park lot andor meter park this lolo is found in plaza with an albertson edg lolo 

wait time 
the onli time i have ever wait at a rosco is when i had a parti of 12 the wait at lolo had a wait time of over 40 minut at 10 am after wait more than 40 minut we were final seat edg roscoes

service
rosco server take your order quick and you get your food extrem quick as well our server at lolo seem nice at first and took our order quick but that is when thing went south i order a kks and a sweet ice tea it took 20 minut to get my sweet tea and 30 minut to get our food in the mean time i watch an empti tabl get occupi by two peopl their order taken and food serv within a span of 10 minut  all befor i got my tea wtf edg roscoes

waffle
hav you ever had eggo if you have you know no amount of butter andor syrup will make it special enter lolo waffl which were essenti plate size eggo with no flavor i onli ate one out of two of my waffl and i love waffl rosco waffl are just better i dont know how they make it and what they put in it but rosco famous waffl just melt in your mouth edg roscoes

chicken
th chicken at rosco is terribl dri everi time i get it no matter white or dark meat this was the best part of lolo the chicken was juici and the bread was season well next time i go i would probabl just order the chicken edg lolos

sid 
i had the grit and egg with my kks platter they were definit authent becaus i felt aw after i ate them grit drown in butter and egg drown in chees edg even

menuprices
expect rough the same price and menu under differ name your go to have the same plate the one wing and one waffl two wing and two waffl with a side etc etc i would say the price are within a dollar of each other but they have koolaid at lolo i havent have koolaid sinc i was a kid and i dont plan on everi have ani in my life again but theyr pretti pound of the fact that they have it on tap edg even

port size
i typic finish my food at rosco and im complet suffer i ate half of my kks and i was die heartwis and stomachwis  i liter couldnt eat ani more the portion size at lolo is so ridicul you could liter split ani of the major combo with anoth person and still be full my kks last me from about 11 am all the way until 9 pm at night edg lolos

conclusion

1 whi did i bring anoth establish into my review of lolo becaus you cannot possibl deem someth the best ever if it all youv ever had 

2 some place are worth the ridicul wait and hype i dont believ this place is 

3 as far as chicken and waffl are concern this place is your averag joint at best 

4 at first i thought this place was favor giant fan over dodger fan but then i realiz the staff was make both group wait equal long which either mean their servic is just bad overal or they would rather tend to local than the tourist who will flood the town everi march not a good way to do business

5 if you insist on eat here go as a group of two you get seat way faster and serv way fastersorri but lolo is high overr 

i dont know where to even begin with lolo i guess i will start by say i will never be back 

the food is overr anyon who can actual cook will tell you that their fri chicken isnt even close to die for it just averag fri chicken their collard green are garbag as well the green from honeybear arent even that good but those definit trump lolo the mac and chees suck i know i am not the onli one who think that too serv size are not generous at all and the price is way too expens 

the servic is about as averag as it get mayb this is due to the fact that the server are alway so busi but most act like the could give two shit about their tip the wait is horrend it alway at minimum a 35 minut wait for my parti not to mention if anyon show up who is consid a somebodi they will usher them past everyon right to their table

anyway i hate to hate but the main reason that this place is so success is becaus the have enter into a nich market in the valley it not becaus of their food servic or manag 

pros
lot of seating
great drinks

cons
service
food
wait times
atmosphere
too expensive
overal unfriend staffi had grand expect for calistro bistro i love farmtot i love the fresh local food movement sad it just didnt measur up 

a nod to our server as servic was excel and the that spici mango thingi drink a serrano pepper  mango infus tequila margarita is uniqu and will pleas those of you who like cocktail with a bite 

but that about as good as it got farmtot inspir vision of entre with crisp fresh complex and discern flavor our food remind me of standard hotel fare 

we start with the crab cake and while the crab was veri good there was way too much filler to the extent that i would get whole bite of filler disappoint my palat with a meali breadi effect 

next one of each of the street taco both were terribl  like disgust  greasi bewar hold these puppi right over your plate becaus as you angl them for a bite a river of tacoseason infus oil will stream out the back and the chilipowd flavor didnt do it for me 

final the arctic char entre the veget and the fish were each overcook though there was some potenti as the cut of fish seem qualiti and the veggi select show good choic besid be overcook there was no flavor none nada  

so all of this disappoint and 95 later not includ tip i think it safe to say i wont be make the trek to calistro bistro againwhere did the day go  i look at the clock and saw it was 530pm i knew jare would be home soon and hungri for dinner and sinc i told him id make us someth i ran out to the store  sick of the safeway up the street i decid to tri frys instead  id been in onc befor but i didnt rememb it be as bad as it felt today

first of all i didnt feel safe even in the broad daylight as i got out of my car and walk into the store  it not onli felt dirti but the peopl around me were not peopl that i felt comfort around  my gut mustv been right becaus i notic there was at least one secur guard hang out by the door

i held my purs and cell phone close to my bodi as i shop walk by a few peopl with bodi odor and not make eye contact with anyon  the food select at this locat is meh but i manag to find what i was look for some egg chicken breast spinach as well as an addit 20 worth of random sht that i didnt anticip buy today am i the onli one that doe this  i do this all of the time  i walk in with a groceri list of 5 item and walk out with 20  but i digress

th thing that take frys down from a 3 star review to a 2 star review is the annoy thing that you onli get the special frys price if you have a frys card  usual the checkout person has a spare card they can run for you but today that was not the case  sinc i have at least two frys card alreadi that of cours i left at home or in anoth purs or someth i didnt want to take yet anoth one so i had to bother the gentleman behind me to borrow his  thank good he said yes as it did save me 5  

so needless to say ive definit experienc better food store than this specif frys locat  i happen to love the frys super store by the way so it noth against frys as a compani  just this specif store  next time im in need of some quick groceri ill be head elsewher  sorri frysugh 

the main reason im give this place 2 star is becaus of the service
i fulli understand that a place is understaf and has 1 waiter for the whole place but our waiter  ughh

first we order a pitcher of mojito and he bring me a glass

worst was that my friend found hair in his rice and told the waiter about it and he just laugh it off 
are you ef kid me
you know veri well if it was in my friend rice then there had to be hair in someon els rice dish

sad the food we had was realli yummi escargot brie date bacon lamb mojito i wouldv gave this place 4 stars
 
im just thank his rice dish was the last thing we ate or els i wouldv been inspect my food like crazi throughout dinnerhonest to god sheriff joe jail is more comfort than this venu trust me and dont ask whi but i know so here to hope that they just open earlier than they had want to caus right now this mayb the coldest coffe shop ive been in sinc drip or mayb they just dont want you hang around and if that the case they certain have succeed with fli color 

as at this point in time 1st week they have one comfort piec of furnitur and all the rest are bare metal chair 

the space certain doe have potenti with their big outdoor patio and by the look of it they will have a hot kitchen sometim in the futur 

as for the coffe it okay but noth special andbut dont expect ani orang flavor for your italian soda caus they dont seem to think it worthi of stock at either stores

unfortun lux still has no competit in this town awesom locat averag coffe poor ambianc   

while ive never been a huge fan of the origin fair trade i was glad to see that at least a local own shop was open up in the civic space but after my first two visit im underwhelm  same averag coffe and food as the origin although i do give high mark to their italian soda but zero ambianc  sorri but patio furnitur uncomfort at that doe not belong insid a coffe shop   hope they are wait for real furnitur to arriv and will migrat the patio furnitur outsid where it belong  

anoth downsid is the fact that the dont seem well set up for studi and cowork while im not a huge fan of comput in coffe shop they are now ubiquit and should be well accommod especi in a place that will be frequent by univers student as it is sever of the outlet are near the ceil sorri but shaq is no longer in town moreov they dont seem to have their own wifi but are reli on asus connections

il chalk this initi impress up to open week chao and hope that in a few week theyll have finish decor and ad some art to warm the place up as well as couch easi chair and lounger and some decent bistro tabli stop be a fan long ago long ago

their new taglin  propaganda realli  is fresher  easyer 

they forgot the truth shittier 

fresh  easi launch by the evil tesco somehow becam demonstr wors with it recent acquisit by someon that i would never bother look up i imagin that it was go to be walmart that would take over for the essenti uk version of walmart tesco and be the parent compani to destroy the chain 

nope there are plenti of disgust corpor out there more than will to complet chang everi good thing about a company

week coupon  a relic of the past 

continu refus of all manufactur coupon continu as befor though

they have some usda certifi organ groceri item so i will not onestar them although i should after make me go through the most unpleas groceri shop experi ever peanut butter recal call my integr into question hope whoever purchas this piti chain from tesco fire the clown manag from this locat 

fresh  easi they have organ item  but they may or may not be taint to the point of caus death pbutter  and when you return their deathproduct they will tri to not furnish the credit as requir by their own stupid voluntari recal 

it is a shame the us govern is not compet enough to have a consum protect agenc that will shutter store that behav like this they no longer carri certifi organ peanut butter by the way  e

edit date 24 decemb 2013 

postscript appar they do have usda certifi organ peanut butter again after not carri it for seem a year after their infam recal the signific other bought some and i love to live danger so i am brave consum it  fool me onc order the french onion soup and it was so salti i could bare eat it best part though the slice of bread on top was a hamburg bun how lame  the waitress was cool and veri attent my friend order chili chees fri that were huge and tast decent  the burger was a greasi mess 

i love the set up of this place there have been so mani differ restaur here and none seem to last long and with mediocr food i doubt this one will lastjazz brunch complet with a guitarist and bass player serv 12230pm sunday onli we made a reserv not know how busi they would be when we show up we were surpris to see not as mani peopl as we anticip be there first thing when i was seat in the booth i immedi notic a cluster of white hair and old dri skin flake right next to me i want to vomit grandma had not onli left behind the free newspap they offer but she also left behind her dna the server was apologet and clean it up then offer me a black napkin in exchang for the white one on the tabl bonus point i had a black dress on 

this is a nontradit style brunch go over the menu select you can either choos between do just the ayc serv yourself brunch for 45 or you can do the ayc in addit to entre hong kong style grouper belgium waffl with caramel pecan cream some of the offer for 58 they have a ramen station along with what they were call dim sum there were onli two avail pork bun and shrimp shiu mai a salad station with differ offer like capres waldorf mediterranean pasta etc a small charcuteri and chees board my chees was hard at the end as well as crab claw and what they were call kumamoto oyster i dont think they were kumamoto and chill shrimp as well as some sushi roll that were about groceri store qualiti my favorit station happen to be the fruit they had lambootan dragonfruit and my favorit passion fruit dessert station had most parfait type offer with some cake pop and one truffl and differ creme puff 

in addit they offer free flow veuv clicquot for anoth 35 or mimosa for 19 this is in addit to the cost of brunch

servic was less than stellar i had to continu ask for refil on my coffe and water she didnt come around often 

i left disappoint ive had way better brunch in town and at this price point you can do betteryo  30 freakin minut from the time i walk in the door til im draggin my keester back out  that dont sound half bad until you figur i didnt eat yet  yo  i aint yankin your sausag either  30 minut through the line and waitin for the freakin food

i call ahead and they said it would be faster to just come in  how you like that  then i get back to the offic and one of the freakin sandwich aint even what i freakin order  you gotta be freakin kiddin me

thi was a one star review until the sandwich was pretti good know what im sayin

hey did you talk to da guy about dat thing  you know dat thing i told you aboutlet me start by say i have been here twice
th first time was amaz with an amaz waiter name terri who did bar trick for us and cater to our ever need even to our friend who has troubl make decis and embarrass us onli downsid was the prices

th second time i dont think i will ever go back we had a waitress name ami with a high pitch and shrill voic who forgot our drink numer timesa well as tri to be a bit too friend steal one of my prize stuf anim to my side and say i should watch betterveri comfort to know that my stuff could be stolen from me as i eat yes she was nice and ok as a waitress i guessbut onc it came to the bill it said we ad an 18 option tip for your conveni the tip was go to be 25 dollarsw decid 15 would be good enough

a we left she ran after us say we were a bit shi from the amount due we glad point out that the tip was option but it seem ms ami was not happi about it i aim for 20 that fine but you didnt get it she got mad and said she need to talk to the manag befor we left this got us veri angri becaus she treat us like thiev or someth  she then came back 10 min later say we can go well if i would have known shed be pissi about a tip id have taken the tip backsecond time here and still a fail i want so bad to like this restaur as a vegetarian it can be hard to find good option at restaur howev for me green owl fall flat on flavor and originality

last go around i had the tlt tempeh instead of bacon and kale chip the tlt was just bore to me and the kale chip too bitter although note that im spoil by the chip i make at home

thi go around i tri the veggi chili and stuf bell pepper the chili was full of chunki tomato and some onion but i onli found 2 chili bean the flavor was tomatoey without much spice if ani the stuf bell pepper also had veri littl flavor and i couldnt find ani almond or raisin in it as the menu indic it would have been delici with a varieti of differ spice but instead was just anoth tomatoeyflavor soft mess my tabl mate dous their food heavili with salt to make up for the flavori couldnt bring myself to add all that msg when some red pepper cumin cilantro ginger deargodanyth would realli have been amazing

for those who are vanilla eater and dont like ani sort of spice this might be your perfect cup of tea or if your in to all the fake meatsmost of the menu option involv fake meat howev id rather eat someth that isnt tri to be some meat entre id rather my vegetarian meal stand on it own as someth delight yummi for what it is not what it tri to be a focus on veget would be a nice touch toolov my veggi vedg restaur in philadelphia is fantast for comparison

oh green owl good lucki want to tri you and like you ill keep an eye on the menu to see if anyth changwent there on a friday night with a friend after tri sever place nearbi that were crowd and had a long wait we end up here as a lastresort and i had doubt that the vegetarianon menu was go to satisfi my palett im veri proanim but i also crave flavaaaa this is a veri small restaur and the place was relat empti hmmm a sign mayb 

tgo is a cute cozi littl place off of atwood avenu in a charm neighborhood when our server greet us i was immedi put off by the fact that she was wear a nose ring sorri but i just dont think that appropri in the workplac especi the servic industri call me oldfashion she was friend though offer some suggest and compliment the chef on his abil i felt a littl more confid that my meal prepar was in good hands

when the meal arriv howev my companion and i were both underwhelm we order the empanada and schnitzel respect veri bland no flavor small portion and waaay overpr it as if they just threw our dinner togeth and forgot to add the season and spice we both left disappoint which was frustrat consid we had driven around quit a while and work up an appetit we wont be backas tasti as the piggi look from the outsid i wasnt too impress with my oink sandwich i order mine with bbq sauc and after take the first bite i found the meat to be dri i quick ask for more sauc you know it cant be that good if im ask for more sauc to make it tast better in addit to the dryness the meat was room temperatur i guess this is how theyr serv but i wouldv prefer mine to be hot 

other than my not so special sandwich the shop is cute sinc it on a love street just off the royal mile the worker werent particular friend but nice enough to serv me my sandwich some peopl love it i just wasnt a fanall i ask for was some asian flavor  and with chines korean and japanes menu item i would have assum this wouldnt be too hard

but ive had better home cook meal for a ton cheaper

lettuc wrapsmeat was tasti but it was just plain chicken in plain lettuceno garnish or dip saucenothingmost bore wrap ever

dumpl souphug portion flavorless dumpl flavorless broth  simpl can be beauti  this was not

seafood noodl soupfor be neon red it was not spici or particular flavor  the noodl were actual cheap spaghettir were actual asian noodl of ani kind too expens  the seafood in it was over cook and also flavorless

look like asian food smell like asian foodwhi doesnt it tast like asian foodwe order the spici pork which was sweet tough and veri greasi  the fri dumpl were regrett although not a complet failur as the spici pork

i ask the server if what she gave us was actual spici pork sinc it didnt even have a hint of spici  she said it was and that the degre of spici depend on the chef work that day  mehawkward everyth about our dinner here was awkward 

we were not drink so we decid to sit in the restaur area we were the onli peopl seat there at the time the tabl we were put at at was awkward with a pole in the middl of it that seem to make it difficult for staff to serv and clear plate the chair were uncomfort 

order was awkward the menu is a sheet of paper you mark your order on our waitress thought my husband onli want an appet  despit the fact that his standardizedtest type order form was clear complet to indic he want a burger with specif top price were high too over 10 for a burger that didnt come with fri 4 if you want to add a side of fri 10 for 3 smallerthantyp slider 

speak of our waitress not onli was she rather poor at read the order form but she also lack in the person depart her entir vibe was a buzz kill 

most of this would be forgiven if the food was good we start with fri mozzarella serv with the blandest marinara ever  my husband had the juici luci which come stuf with chees i had the slider which came with chees and a side of thousand island dress pickl would have been nice i found the meat under season and overcook my husband didnt complain about his burger but he did have a ton of top ad 

even the bathroom was awkward there is no separ between the toilet and sink and a rather gross messi floor 

it took age to get our check we had to ask the busser to find our waitress to final get the hell out of there  there are a lot of place to overpay for a burger and fri on the strip which mean there is no reason for me to ever come back hereboy i thought about this review all day yesterday  i even want to sleep on it befor jump to ani conclus  when it come right down to it i just dont think i am a fan of the two hippi brand from their poor spell pizzaria sign to their magic burger that made my wife sick i havent seen a lot that should impress me

i expect this place to be quick when it came to breakfast  im not sure whi i just did  mayb it was the takeout window or the confin dine area or the togo box that everi meal use  most of all i think i expect it to be quick becaus it is just breakfast food  it realli doesnt take long to throw someth on a hot griddle

aft wait in line for 15 minut we got up to the front to order  they have a breakfast bowl that includ up to 6 top for 6  pretti good deal in my opinion so i was gonna get that  as i order the guy wrote everyth down in longhand and then punch a bunch of stuff into the regist  this whole process took a while and took forev for peopl with complic order  after ask to see what lemonad they were out of which as a lot of them i got a guava one  we paid for our food and the guy then told us that it would be 30 minut  

sinc we couldnt go sit outsid becaus an employe was smoke within about 2ft of the open door so illeg we found a small tabl in the back  there not much to look at and realli not much go on  the peopl are pretti normal and there wasnt a lot of food come out to look at  this gave us plenti of time to wonder whi some scrambl egg took 30minutes

so when our order final come out everyth is packag in these giant plastic take away box  not onli doe this go against my own innerhippi but it is bad for your busi  these contain are not cheap and they take up a ton of room in your trash  both of these issu cost you time and money  they also dont do much for my bowl concept of a meal  in ani event the present was underwhelm even for two hippi standards

th meal was decent but pretti greasi  i had sausag potato mushroom and jalapeno jack chees in my bowl which includ toast  that toast was more like butter bread that was thrown on the same griddl as the greasi potato that made the base for my meal  while the tast of the meal wasnt horribl the toast was horribl it realli wasnt worth sit around wait for 45 minut  

mi issu with this place a mani  they have a giant sign outsid that say breakfast all day yet they stop serv breakfast at 1130  matt the breakfast joynt in scottsdal black bear ihop denni etc etc etc all serv breakfast later than 1130  what give with the horribl fals advertis  
the bulk of their menu is non breakfast item  realli  i can get a burger at 6am but i cant get bacon and egg at 1145am  whi do you even serv lunch stuff  just do breakfast and do it well  your kitchen wouldnt get so back up if you didnt have such a giant menu
get rid of the waffl and pancak  they are just gonna slow you down  do the breakfast bowl and some side  that it  you could bang out breakfast for 1000 in under an hour that way
whi dont you have order slip  wouldnt it make more sens for the peopl wait in line to fill out their order instead of have you write everyth down  just have a list of all the item avail and have peopl circl what they want  you check it to make sure it is 6 or fewer charg them accord and pass the ticket on to the kitchen  it would speed up your whole concept
fin  whi do you let your employe smoke out front  you just cant do that  the next time i am file a complaint with the stateon a recent breakfast outing we ventur up 7th avenu to tri the recent open two hippi breakfast joint the concept is the newest of the two hippi ventur which seem to be pop up all over midtown breakfast offer includ standard like french toast and waffl a coconutcrust hot jam sandwich and breakfast bowl lunch select includ burger sandwich hot dog and salad also avail are vegan smoothi an array of flavor lemonad and the ever present soda fountain 

 the breakfast bowl sound pretti impress 3 egg scrambl with a choic of 6 top select from an extens list of chees veggi sauc and meat but fell short of expect three of us order the bowl which come with texa toast and hash brown and none of us were impress sure the scrambl egg mess was tasti but the potato were bland cube and definit not hash brown in short the bowl is noth special and it could have been done better at home 

 two hippi do a few thing right the price the flavor lemonad the waffl and the mere exist of fri pickl on the menu unfortun there are so mani more thing that they need to improv here the menu clear state that lunch is serv all day but a request for lunch item was refus all order are packag in togo box which is extrem wast the dine area is so clutter that it border on claustrophob no creditdebit card are accept mayb they are still work out the kink which would explain thing like mess up my order and take ten minut to find a knife for a custom 

 the verdict two hippi should have stuck with burger and taco breakfast is just not their forttwo hippi final jump the shark

that is pretti much it in a nutshel 

i was look forward to dine here thing start off well the ice tea was tasti i love the space and the overal concept is great 

i decid on the black bean burger even though the waiter could not tell me for sure what was in it and didnt even bother to ask the chef 

bland dri and bore top with rubberi shitak mushroom and a greasi bunsighi was look for excit i want to be wow noth happen when i put this food in my mouth i was extrem underwhelm 

mi husband order the fish taco serv along side a pile of sticki rice top with black bean and mayo the rice was gluey the cabbag in the taco was soggi it did not tast fresh at all 

the sweet potato fri were not bad they were serv with the hula sauc which is ketchup mayo and pickl ginger 
it flavor way ok but becam cloy after one of two bite 

someth is just miss here if you read the menu it has potenti for great but end up leav much to be desir 

sad it look like enough peopl like the sub par bar food that hula wont be like to make ani chang after a coupl of technic complic earli in their oper ive been back a few time and alway come to the same conclus go for the drink not the food 

at first i thought mayb im just in a bitchi mood and it throw my tast bud off but ive gone with differ peopl and been most in a chipper mood so that wasnt it then i thought i was order odd item off the menu but ive tri a varieti of item from the brunch and dinner menus and come to the same conclus final i decid hula is an awesom place to get a great cocktail it just meh on the food side 

hula definit has one cool patio amaz architectur featur and mighti friend staff i just can negat the eat experi to provid a better rate it wont be my last time here so im hope i can updat with a more spark reviewboardhous serious sandwichestimb newest experi with 4 locat across the las vega valley

first i even heard of this place was an ad i receiv in the mail 200 off per sandwich buy 1 get 1 free after 4pm and 10 off a 25 purchas on the weekend great deals

th ad had their menu print on the back and the sandwich all sound quit appet and a littl differ variat than you see in most sub shop in las vegas

mi 1st attempt at come here i show up at 1030 on a sunday and they didnt open until 1 am so i went elsewhere

thi time it was 4 pm on a friday and i was hungri so i order 3 sandwich to go a beef dipa bbq beef and a pastrami nami 

the cashier was fantasticveri helpfulperki and inform she said they were own by timber game and had been open sinc june 2009 not on twitter yet but a tv commerci air soon

th sandwich are a littl prici 78 each one size fit allsmal than a footlong bigger than a size inchon type of bread

th 1st sandwich was the beef dip thin roast beef  horseradish and onion the beef was ok but not real impress and this was the best of the 3 sandwiches

th 2nd sandwich was the bbq beefsam beef as the french dip slather in bad bbq sauc and some onion thrown in noth memor here

th 3rd sandwich was the pastramiit sure look goodlot of pastramii onli made it through half and had the worst heartburn it seem like it had a ton of pepper too thin pastrami and it was a littl dri and chewi not moist and tender like good pastrami is

overal the employe were veri enthusiast the place had a real cool surfer vibe to it and a simpl menu but it a littl too expens and not impress at all

it nice to see a new place pop up in this economi but i do not have alot of hope for this place especi this locat 

most of the custom will be colleg kid look to eat cheap and port of sub is nearbithere has to be a good reason my parent would never let me eat at jollibe when i was littl  they alway told me the burger are made of worm somebodi gave me a burger from jollibe and i would not touch it

thi is a filipino fastfood joint it like the filipino mickey ds it not fusion or anyth filipino filipino filipino pinoy from the food to the old ladi that cut in line in front of you and no this is definit not the best burger anywher whoever say that it is is a liarjust becaus you saw jollibe in bourdain show doesnt mean you have to believ it i would not recommend a jollibe burger to anyone

 had their chicken joy and that alright  im not a fan of filipino spaghetti with the sweet sauc and red hotdog also made with worm accord to my folk the onli thing i like from this place is peach mango pie

year laterparentless and live in vegasfeel like a rebel i final got the urg to tri their burger it one of those the prodig son moment where i was like i shouldv listen to my parent pack thisgave jolibe yet anoth tri at this locat and im convinc that im not a fan of the over hype chicken joy definit no joy anywher on that plate

i guess if i grew up on this stuff it would be a differ stori the place is clean and the servic was good but this filipino fast food doe not appeal to me at all yes this aint  much of a yelp approv busi but im sure the filipino communiti will keep jolibe from close up shop

th onli thing that may draw me back are their pie which are the closest thing to mickey ds old school appl piesalohai receiv a restaurantcom gift certif for fresh wasabi for christma and final decid to use it tonight yes i know christma was 5 month ago

w brought anoth coupl with us and i told them we need to spend 100 to get the 50 per what the certif had said other than that no restrict so we order alot of sushi roll edamam gyoza and teriyaki chicken

 the food was realli good we stuf out face and then we got our bill we gave our waitress the certif and debit card she then tell us that we cannot use that gift certif even though there is no expir date and state the restaur is respons for the discount we then tri to use our yelp checkin for the free appet she tell us that not for their locat even when we show her where the address is on the deal

aft all said and done we pay our full bill and left we never would have order so much food if we knew they were go to refus the gift certif the custom servic was aw and unfortun that is sway my opinion of them i will more than like never go back becaus im pretti angri over my experii like this place though their product are more expens im happi to support small local sourc busi 

but i wont support a busi where i receiv mediocr custom servic i walk in to get gts kombucha which i can get for a few quarter less at safeway but i was in the area of temp farmer market after select my beverag i got to the counter and was ask if i was a student becaus asu student get discount in two year of occasion visit to this market that had never been brought up but appar it been ongo 

i get the 10 discount though i am a littl disgruntl that i had never been ask about it befor i go to open my drink at which point the liquid explod everywher the drink is high effervesc but never like this im sit there get drench from the kombucha and none of the three employe just stand behind the counter take notic i ask for some napkin and an employe just point over to a tabl at this point half of my drink is on me and i am not abl to enjoy all of it aw man that suck was all i got from the man behind the counter

whol food would have replac it  at no addit cost to me if they saw that happen it was poor custom servic and i will not be returnif you want to fit in san tan valley here is a step by step guide

1 be realli proud of yourself for buy a super cheap hous in the middl of nowher but dont tell anyon the locat bc the moment you do peopl are less impress and more turn off 

2 bc of 1 you can afford rim on your car be sure to buy the ugliest  one possibl peopl here prefer black rim with chrome outline

3 roll down your windows

4 tune your radio to rap music 

5 blast it realli loud

6 drive with your left arm onli straight out and lean back be sure you wear your wrist watch on this arm so that other can see it out your window bonus point if you wiggl your wrist pretend to adjust the watch but realli you just want it to sparkl under the light

im not exagger we saw about 10 differ car like this while eat our china chef 

i just check out someon profil who live in san tan valley first person i click on list interest purpl drank what are the chanc i rest my case

thi whole review is an embarrass but it must be said 

dont ask whi i was in this part of town last night but i was and we were wait for a long time in this shop center and hadnt had dinner china chef of burger king china chef it is 

the food wasnt disgust actual it was just meh but edibl and better than bk on 2nd thought mayb if i find myself in that horribl townshop center i will do bk the space was clean and blah blah blah  

that not the problem the problem is that the meal doesnt come with a gas mask for later and my bodi wasnt the onli one have issu with this food for the record ive eaten my fair share of question food and i have never had a reaction like this 

shhuuuuuuuuuweeeeeeeeack  so i was terribl excit while wait month and month for giant to open becaus 1 i like the tuck away locat 2 i love coffe and 3 we spend a lot of time at the library

so this morn after scoop up some krispi kreme donut mmmm to take over to my friend kate hous for brunch i decid to pop by and grab a coffe to go sinc the previous 2 attempt at visit giant were met with a close sign

i gave 2 star becaus i realli do like the space  there were a few peopl hang out and i walk up to the counter where 2 girl were work  the girl behind the cash regist was talk to a guy at the counter  i then saw the cash onli sign which wasnt such a big deal to me as i had some cash in my car today though normal i dont and probabl wouldnt have made the trek to cvs as i was in a hurri and had my 3 yr old in tow

i ask the girl not talk if she could start my drink while i ran out to get my money  she told me to order from the other girl  i took two step to my left and stood behind the chat guy  they kept chat  no bueno  i look at the other girl again who was just stand there and again ask her if i could order my drink  she look at the talk girl and final said sure

i order 2 shot of espresso over ice with a shot of vanilla  my summer morn caffein jolt  i was told by said girl that she couldnt make this for me

excus me  i was told that she was not allow to make this as the espresso was to onli be order in so it could be drank drunk within 10 minut for the flavor brand of giant  i tri to persuad her again let her know i didnt want to drink it there  nor did i want to drink it hot as id just been hang out in a 105 degre park lot for the past hour  i was told no

no  serious  this girl  who i didnt even know  was tell me what i could or couldnt drink when i hadnt had ani caffein yet  it probabl a good thing my daughter was with me after all as be turn down for espresso  pms dont coexist veri happily

sh ask if id like someth differ  i simpli said no when i realli want to say oh so much more with includ  word  

i will not be back  thank there are other option with my 1 be royal coffe and i would have even made the trip up to lux if i hadnt been in a hurry

so french press coffe at kate it was and i would strong recommend that matt get over his flavor brand theori if he want to thrive and to teach his employe the concept of the custom be right if they are polit have cash and arent ask for someth ridicul out of the ordinary

jeeshyike i had no idea that they were in the middl of a polit fight with food cart and that they were close down not too long ago by the health depart 
httpvegaseatercomarchives20120410mamitasstaysclosedafterhealthdistrictreinspectionphp

thi was one of those let be spontan moment just make me realiz that i need to stay on top of my restaur research and not just take a chance

anyway i had their shrimp dish with garlic she bring me pollo i have her take it back and she bring me the shrimp dish the shrimp must have been in the sauc for 10 minut  total overcook yike i say again  

we had step out from the yelp event to have a lookse in the funki neighborhood and the mamitascuban neon sign drug me right over there  when we got insid it remind me of some of the mexican restaur dive in portland and that a good thing i should have realiz that there were most onli white face eat their food and step back out thoughi have walk by this joint a million time and alway want to check it out becaus of it diadelosmuertosonsteroid decor i normal go for atmo over food qualiti anyway so i wasnt too concern with read ani of the other review here

th chief complaint regard this place seem to concern the cleanli and the serviceattitudeso let me address both

appar the place was close down by the health dept recent for have 52 health code violat  i might not have dare to eat here had i known thisbut as it was i have been here twice and had the chicken fajita taco both time onc mexican and onc cubanstyl both time they were way abov averag the veggi were fresh and ginorm and delici the chicken was well spice and succul and the accoutr rice bean etc were averag 

on both my visit my friend had the chimichanga one friend love it the other one said meh 

the chip and salsa were pretti good but theyr stingi with them and onli give you one littl basket for free the guacamol was kinda eh but with all the other food i didnt even notic and the place look realli clean so who knows

a for the servic on my 1st visit we were one of onli three tabl in there at the time and servic was fine but on my second visit it was busier and it took about 45 minut for them to get our food out and all that time they were too cheapass to give us more chip lame

al in all the servuc suck the food is ok and the atmo is great crazi decor and amaz retro 80s music video play on a big screen tv while you eat 

other review also mention mamita haterish attitud toward food trucksand i think this is the crux of mamita imag problem

they were on east fremont street befor zappo was even a gleam in some modest mous fanboy bespectacl bicycl eye mamita predat the hipster infestationthey surviv year of life on east fremont befor it was cool so is it ani fuck wonder they dont want trendi shitti food truck roll in and steal their bid 

mamita is like that grumpi old man in the neighborhood whos constant yell at you kid to get off his goddamn lawn they dont have a twitter feed they dont have a thing to check in and they dont serv pabst blue ribbon or have a bike rack out front 

mamita if your listen and you want a piec of that sweet sweet hipster buckstop complain and start be more iron statthe sad thing is that everi japanes resid of clark counti would rather shop at greenland market than nakata or japan creek  whenev i am at greenland i find everi singl japanes person i know hang out at the japanes food aisl i constant run into the cook from monta the angri old man from ichiza a ton of various sushi chef and even the worker from inaba do these authent japanes restaur actual get their ingredi from a korean market

th produc here is aw and total fcking cost too much 

the onli nice worker are the latino one no one els ever even give me eye contact 

k jun chicken in the food court was good while it last but appar they fcking kick them out fck you mr greenland or whoever the fck own this place

chappagetti is the best jajangmeon we got here in lv but i feel it slight miss someth on account of the fact that it not chines own jajangmeon is not korean it shock me how mani korean think it is an authent korean dish jajangmeon is a chines dish which becam veri popular in korea 

anyon who know me know that i alway bitch to my japanes friend most particular aaron k about how korean tend to treat me like sht i dont appreci it at all my mom is korean so that make me korean and dure my youth i constant attempt to reach out to the korean communiti but was alway push away by snotti fob korean who hate everi singl damn thing about me my dad is a 3rd generat japanes american and no one in my famili speak ani other languag but englishbut is that a just reason to consid me an outsid in the korean communiti  my brother took more of the korean side of the gene pool and grew up to be 65 mani of you idiot dont know this but the averag height in south korea is actual around 510 which is consider taller than south american and african countri korean tend to be one of the taller ethnic group in the world well the worker at greenland assum my brother is korean on account of his massiv height and they treat him pretti darn good but i cant get ani sympathi over here i hate how at japanes market they think im korean and at korean market they think im japanes and at chines market they think im weird

okay the best thing here at greenland is the frozen smile rabbit moon creme bread believ me you have to fcking tri it pictur here  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosqvo3l9q0kvqe7w9jl9epwfsidiot7lwwfeoarlbsyg77wvb2tk6mbkpndneukb3y2a

they also sell those mega size mexican coke for 14 the price you would get them at world of coke for world of coke is offici useless now and sucks

iv experienc this epidem of white dude marri to asian women tri to shield their wive when i walk by them  they liter grab their wive and hold them realli tight when they make eye contact with me what the fck is this what the hell is go on here i know im realli fcking hot and im a giant woman but im not gonna steal your damn mail order bride stop be so paranoid i have white uncl and most my white friend are marri to asian womenit funni caus in hawaii it just a casual normal thing for white and asian to marrybut for some reason the peopl here in lv think they are live some john lennonyoko ono fantasi and that their relationship is forbidden or some stupid sht go shop at albertson or smith then if you dont feel comfort shop around asian peopl 

whenev i come to this koreatown shop center i usual just walk straight over to sushi on rainbow while my brother eat at chappagetti i dont know how we turn out so differ 

the moral of the stori is to eat frozen smile rabbit moon cream bread with mexican coke

upd today i was at greenland market and the worker were talk about how confus they were that  everyon was now sudden buy frozen smile rabbit moon cream bread appar they had a hard time sell it in the pastim all for a littl competit in the crawfish world  but cajun crawfish is definit not up for the challeng  i was super hesit with all the negat review but still kept in open mind

it a larg restaur space with addit seat in the back around the corner with tvs abound  howev it a pretti steril environ blame it on the high ceilings

w start out with two pound of crawfish 999lb with their hous special season and medium spice level  they have a warn that say their spici level is two level higher than normal  the husband did ask ahead of time if the crawfish was big and fresh and the waitress said it was  she also point out the tank in the back so we could have a look  i did walk over there to take a peek and notic they had lobster and clam in the tank too  you also get one side of corn and potato for order two pound or more of crawfish

when our order arriv in a silver bowl we notic a differ right away  this wasnt the way we want our crawfish and that was our mistak  the husband ask for some lime salt and pepper to make a dip sauc but that couldnt help this crawfish  sure they were larg but they were also dri out  there was no head juic to suck out at all  when you break the head off you can tell there someth wrong immedi  and the sauc in the bottom of the bowl is this water down concoct of someth or other  i dont think it as fresh as they say it is the one in the tank are just for show i think    

the staff were friend and realli anxious to refil our beverag  but it couldnt make up for the sad crawfish  we left after our two pound and head up spring mountain for hot n juici crawfish instead  

we didnt order the famous shrimp that get all the rave but did see some on someon els tabl and they were larg inde  but then again this restaur is call cajun crawfish not cajun shrimp 

i did ask if they had ani grand open special especi sinc other yelper mention it but we were told they werent offer them anymor  howev i did notic an ad offer a discount on beverag just the other day   oh well

overal cajun crawfish doesnt measur up for good crawfish the way i like it  sorry

060710 updat  in a recent magazin articl they are chang their name from cajun crawfish to the crawdaddi crab hous  hope that help with busistop in here for lunch the other day quiet littl independ chines restaur that also has a hawaiian style menu

not mani option for vegetarian no tofu dish to be found didnt realli dig my noodl  veggi  pineappl dish henc the 2 star rateeveryth up to the point of my wed went well the ladi are veri on top of the whole order process and veri nice to deal with i wouldnt have even written a review except i feel like they could have been a littl more apologet  about deliv my wed cupcak late to my recept i had all my guest sit watch the assembl of my cupcak tower when they were to be deliv an hour befor the recept was set to start then i get an email notifi me that i was late make final payment but sinc they neglect to call me to ask for payment they were go to wave ani and all late charg um if gss had call me right after my wed i would have paid the balanc in full so i realli didnt understand the email let me know how kind they were to wave late charg that would have been their issu to begin with sinc they neglect to phone me to get the balanc after servic were render it was kind of like they want to write me and tell me how kind they were wave the late charg when it was their fault for not call me sooner when i email them back explain that i was disappoint with how late the cupcak were deliv all i got was a sorri pleas call us as soon as possibl and make final payment not what i expect cupcak were cute and tast pretti good from what i was abl to tast a littl pricey but that the trend i guess i was disappoint in their lack of remors over the late deliveri and their annoy email about neglect to call me for payment i think i should have at least receiv some kind of a peac offeri guess my mistak is that i ate at lobbi in the even when the owner wasnt there

th young ladi work the counter was sweet and was tri her best but miss get the order correct two burger were order with chees and bacon unfortn the secret saus was ad on to the burger we just wipe the sauc off but what an inconveni my burger was miss the bacon and a littl under cook meh ive tast better the chicken sandwich suck accord to my wife so that put a downer on the whole meal and a real silent car drive over to chick fil a to get a replac for the uneaten chicken sandwichhigh disappoint in my last meal i was happi to have found this place earlier this year but i will now just cook my food at home 

i was the first person in the restaur and place my order famili member of the waitress walk in and becam prioriti they receiv multipl banchan right away and had food serv to them after they order while i sat around with just barley water initi when i had even ask for barley water the waitress act like it was a hassl to even have to serv it and told me they didnt have ani 

mi banchan came with my meal and there were three item a coupl came in next to me and order and ask for cabbag kimchi and was told they couldnt have ani becaus it didnt go with the meal excus me as a korean i have never seen anyon been told they cant have banchan i told the coupl that wasnt standard servic that is usual receiv from that waitress in other occas i ask the waitress for more banchan and in a serious tone she told me she didnt have ani more to give me

i had plan on order food for my husband to take home and she put the check on my tabl while i was still in the middl of my meal  her prioriti becam watch the soap opera on tv rather than servic 

speak of the meal my jampong consist most of pepper pure disappoint 

i felt as though i receiv prejud servic i was speak korean and attempt to be polit but all she saw in her eye was a half white person who she didnt have time for i call my mom enrag after the meal and she agre that for some meal you dont necessarili serv certain banchan but if someon ask for it you should oblig 

i will not enter this establish againpink is one of those overhyp place and sinc this locat is in vega also super overpr it was locat right outsid the planet hollywood hotel and wasnt hard to find with it bright pink name etch on the glass at least there was no line at all when we got there onli outdoor seat so refrain from get anyth too spici in the humid weather

it was 675 for my bacon chili chees dognot realli worth it especi when the one at the origin pink in la cost almost half that it was top with bacon tomato chees and mustard sinc i didnt want onion on mine httpwwwyelpcombizphotosuqb9ks7lzesghltmuunmeaselect3fcshb9yqxmpuyvnn8fyxa the bacon was nice and crispi but the hot dog was tini and wasnt anyth special the one from costco are way bigger 

mi bun was also flimsi and broke in half after 2 bite it could have use much more chili and the chees wasnt melt enough it was still a tasti meal overal but total not worth the price tagsorri fellow yelper this place didnt cut it for me  we stop in for breakfast  i read other review and peopl realli love it 

she came to get out drink order and left menus for us to look at  my husband menu had milk all over the insid of it  so tip 1 wipe down your menus  tip 2 wipe down your tabl also  

had finish my coffe and had to wait for our meal to be deliv to get my second cup  hmmm  no problem becaus my food was in front of me now

i order the crab cake egg benedict  it came with a side of potato  the benedict was good had a uniqu flavor and the hollandais didnt overpow  the potato howev wah wah  they were so disappoint that i didnt have more than two small bite  they were too mushi with not enough crisp on the outsid  bummer  

now for the real let down  my husband order the countri fri steak  he was actual enjoy it until   a hair was found in it  that complet ruin our appetit and breakfast was over  so tip 3 wear hair net in the kitchen pleas  

i will say that our waitress was veri friend and courteous  we didnt say anyth about the hair to her  we were just readi to leav  

i dont see us come back anytim soon  real bummersee photo for tequila recommendation

cam here twice this last year  locat is nice  

1st time foodservic for the foodnot realli that great  i tri to eat here and left becaus the servic was lack  water were not fill  food came cold and without condiment we need like salsa and when we ask for it the server forgot about us 

2nd time they earn an extra star becaus of groupon they had a special for 15 for 30 worth of food or drink the best part was that for some reason groupon onli charg 1 i was like what i dont care how bad the place was beforedollar for drink im in i purchas 2  

appar it was some mistak but groupon honor it and i came arm with 30 to spend  went straight to the bar and got two 14 shot of tequila that came in a worm shape  bottle

smooooooooth so if you come arm with the groupon or not get the tequila in the worm bottl you will not regret it skip the food  hagar earn the extra star for the worm bottl tequila basic and the nice bartend  didnt have time to use the other groupon on that tripbut worm tequilaim come back for youafter miss out on tri the bacchan buffet with my friend i got in a few hour later than they did i was determin to tri someth new so that i would still have someth els to write about  fortunatelyunfortun that someth new end up be cabo wabowhich alway seem like more of a drink spot than as a place to eat at  now i know why

although cabo wabo isnt a mainstream type of chain restaur it still pretti much a chain and the food realli reflect that  i kept expect to a minimum for my carnita taco and what i got was pretti mediocreand overpr  two taco spanish rice and bean for 15  i know it the strip and all but damn httpwwwyelpcombizphotoscabowabocantinalasvegasselectvguzqf4mtuutzme9wgw8swj9puawgzop0unrzmnxg4bg  the tast of the carnita was driven heavili by their generic sauc rather than the savori season flavor youd get from someth authent but at least the taco were fair fullso yay

a far as our drink went my friend seem most satisfi with what they had  i order the chupa chupa cocktail which was kind of fun to drink but not particular amaz  essenti they flip a mini corona into a regular margarita at your tabl and you have to quick drink it befor it all overflow httpwwwyelpcombizphotoscabowabocantinalasvegasselectvguzqf4mtuutzme9wgw8swrvcrswcsgg5its4n6ocaq  creativ and uniqu but pricey consid it wasnt that heavi on the alcohol
 
amaz though what hurt more than overpay for generic and medicor food was my lack of recept stop me from check in on yelp when we first sat down  as petti and trivial as that sound i would have seen the free margarita with the purchas of an entré deal befor i order and i could have save myself 12 on that chupa chupa  ughgood luck and good night

iv been to a lot of bw3s befor and sure it an averag chain restaur but wow doe this locat have some serious issu  i hate write bad review i realli tri to onli review place i like which there are plenti of but tonight on yelp im slam down a second bad review and this place take the cake

 been here probabl 45 time and the last 2 visit were just ridicul  the first time was for my fantasi footbal leagu  the servic was atroci slow with us wait 20 minut inbetween everi waitress visit and 45 minut for our wing the wireless connect was drop constant throughout the draft they sat us right next to anoth fantasi leagu and both leagu could bare hear what anyon was say and the food was    well typic bw3s food which is to say not that great but fill your stomach i guess  at the end of the draft all of us vow never to have it there again

mi last visit was probabl one of the worst custom servic experi ive ever had asid from mayb someon do someth to the food

w had a pretti big group about 15 peopl and were all meet up to watch some playoff footbal game  our group was come in sporad over the cours of about an hour but id say about half of us put our food order in around the same time  the waitress was an older ladi and i could alreadi tell by how slow the drink refil were come to not expect much  shoot ahead a littl bit and were wait a long time for our food  normal i wouldnt care at a place like this on a day like this becaus were watch footbal and laugh and all that good stuff  but this was crazytown long wait  the two friend of mine who show up last about 3040 minut after us got their food befor the rest of our group  so at that point we knew someth was up we talk to our waitress when she final come back 15 minut later and she goe back to check  anoth 15 minut go by  she is walk around help other custom tray of food are go out to everi tabl but our and final she come over when we flag her  she tell us she made a mistak and didnt punch in our order but shes now taken care of it and the food should be out soon

anoth 30 minut  go by  im not joke  shes come by mayb onc to refil drink and let us know casual that the food should be out soon  most of the time we see her walk around like we dont exist  we flag her down and ask what go on with the food  she tell us shell check  15 minut go by  final food come out  she doesnt know whos food goe where and half the order are miss  we order stuff to go with our wing it not here  she goe back and tell us it should be out soon  20 minut go by  final we get the rest  hell it took us like 15 minut to get dip sauc that was suppos to come with our wing let alon the rest of the food  nari an apolog or sign of sincer  i go over and talk to the manag and he immedi seem to be on the upandup about the situat  he seem distraught and genuin and say hell take 50 off the food and hand me a stack of 5 off coupon  

were watch the game wait for our check  anoth 30 minut go by  im not make this stuff up folk  bill final come out comp are on it food is all with the wrong peopl we send the waitress back to get it figur out after we all write down for her what we all had  15 minut later we get new bill it most fix but there are now no  comp like the manag said  so we all throw in 2 of our 5 coupon  2030 minut later were final abl to pay as most of us are yawn and wonder if were go to have to pitch a tent  i was on the verg of a dine and ditch someth id never consid  on the way out a few of the girl go talk to the manag again and then relat that he was upset when he saw that we use the coupon and explain that the bill was correct even though 15 peopl saw that it was clear wrong with full price and no comp   it turn out it was the waitress third day half of me felt bad the other half was still disappoint that she didnt handl the situat better  she didnt even make an attempt to be apologet or act like she care  i onli gave them ani star becaus they have big tvs beer and space  im be generous 

we got there at 515pm  we left at 930pm  do  not  go hereword to the wise make sure you eat befor you go so that by the time your food arriv youll be hungri again

im just disappoint that i had to wait 20 minut to be greet by our server without the thrill of a lap dance

w were so thrill when our server final arriv that we gave him our drink appet and entre select im not sure if youv heard but this is how servic at a restaur normal work you arriv your greet by the hosthostess then seat at the proper tabl that will accommod your parti size comfort next the server or server assist greet you within 5 minut to take your drink order and offer some appet suggest onc the drink arriv they take the order for both your appet and your entre or just your appet and give you some more time to look over the menu while they put your appet inshould i say more guess what happen after he took all three order anoth 20 minut of stare at each other and our appet arriv they took so long to get to us i forgot what we order appar we order the craw puppi they were good an innov dish with an origin sauc to match

unfortun the appet was a teas for the beast my stomach guess what came after the appet anoth waitbi this time i was tri to think happi thought and sing some lullabi to keep the beast distract my date ask if we could have some bread sinc all the other tabl around us had some while we were wait he also ask the server if he could check on the status of our food my date decid to take a smoke break while i start to die in slow motion and feel my stomach feed off itself

fin our food arriv i had order the catfish platter which came with two side i chose green and sweet potato fri the starvat i was experienc made me so delusion that i actual thought the word platter meant more than one piec of fish nopejust one as long as the food took i was hope that the cook had gone to the lake and caught a  school  of fish for me to eat can you believ that after all that my green were gross  cold and my sweet potato fri were lukewarm unfortun i had to work the next dayso i couldnt send them back i did enjoy my  catfish howev as long as it took to makei was expect it to be orgasm i did want to tri dessert but like i said beforei had to work the next evening


th moral of the stori lukewarm thing come to those who wait

manag an hour and a half for a 2 cours meal are you ef kid me pleas feel free to retrain your staff use my tip as a guid i swear i wont even take credit for itas much as ive come to love their burrito im give up on burrito drive ive tri over the summer to keep my enthusiasm but im not tri ani more

th onli good thing about this place is the food  the bad thing list here have caus me to walk away 1 slow of servic 2 late deliv time and 3 inaccuraci of the orders

1 if i place an order over the phone to pick up at your locat dont tell me to be there in 10 minut when 10 minut later you havent even start on my order  also dont say no it will be readi in 10 minut when i offer to be there in 15 or 20 minutes

2 if you tell me that the order will be deliv in 30 to 50 minut dont show up in an hour

3 if i order chip and salsa bring me the damn salsasometim you cant return home

year ago i use to frequent casa del sol on a regular basi when there were far fewer option for mexican food  it was relat inexpens the food was decent and the kid menu provid option for the finicki eater   when my wife and i were look for a place to grab a quick lunch we decid to take a trip down memori lane and revisit casa del sol  let just say that it may be anoth ten year until we return for our next visit

servic ran hot and cold dure my recent visit  there was no one to greet me when i enter the restaur  it wasnt a big deal sinc it gave a chanc to perus the menu while wait for my dine companion to arriv  we were seat by an energet server but it was the stoner server see heather cs review who took our order  he was except mellow this day and spoke in a whisper tone so i had to repeat ask him to repeat what he was say  it was comedi gold but the novelti wore off by the end of the meal  to his credit he kept the chip basket full and check in period to make sure everyth was to our satisfaction

th food was more miss than hit  i did enjoy the chip  while not fresh made they were warm well season and not greasi  the salsa  tomato pure was bland so i ask for some hotter salsa  big mistak  what we got was vile graini mixtur of veget oil and chili powder  to their credit it was spici  so spici that it complet blew out my palett for the first half of the meal

th chili verd was an impress entré  the pork was tender the green chili ad a dollop of heat and the onion and cilantro complet the dish  the side were a letdown the rice was overcook and the refri bean had that fresh out of the can feel  if you find yourself stare that the casa del sol menu await culinari inspir just order the chili verd and dont look back

mi wife did not fare as well with her chicken fajita  the meat was dri and chewi from be overcook and lack ani hint of season  the veget were mushi from be overcook and swim in a pool of oil 

the fri ice cream was also a flaw dish  the coat lack ani crunch at all  it was as if someon pour a bowl of corn flake and milk let it sit overnight and then press the result mush over a ball of ice cream total train wreck  also absent was ani nutmeg or cinnamon  the ice cream was of poor qualiti heavi on the ice light on the cream  i did enjoy the fri tortilla at the bottom of the dish light dust with sugar and cinnamon use it to scoop up the honey and whip cream serv with this dessert

despit the thorough satisfi chile verd i dont think ill be beat a path back too casa del sol  the kitchen is just too inconsist and there are much better option for mexican food in madison113010

cam for happi hour but didnt find anyth on the happi hour food menu i want to tri so i order a medium emilia romagna pizza mozzarella parmesan and 12year balsam vinegar aceto balsamico  cant recal what the price was on this pizza but it was probabl around the 14 rang  the pizza came a bit too char on the bottom and the veri thincrust didnt stay crispi for veri long perhap just 5 minut and definit soggi by the 10minut mark  while i enjoy the slice i had at the restaur the leftov prove to be too salti when i tri to reheat the pizza at home so i had to toss the rest not econom for the price im sorri to say  i onli ate a slice at fred bec i want to tri the cobbleroftheday which was the appl cobbler top w haagendaaz ice cream if i recal correct  had to order it san powder sugar corn allergi and i found it good and not too sweet  id tri their other cobbler too if they didnt come at a high cost 9 plus the ice cream has corn syrup in it corn allergi  id also like to tri the profiterol but they too come w a 9 tag which mean 450 per profiterol i believ id ask how mani came in a dish and was quot two

dont be fool by the scowl that the bouncertyp bartend constant has on his face he actual was nice to talk to at least the first time i spoke to him  a coupl of friend and i went there after a mixer about a month ago and he was unapproach and project himself to be too busi to do more than to come over and take our order  no hello and howarey that night such a big turnoff and w a highpric menu i dont think ill come by again

i origin was go to rate 3 star but type it up as 25 but now that ive finish w my review im go to go w 2 star  i wish you better experi here yourselfas i sit here drink my doubl espresso from the newli open buzzberri i contempl the whole support your local busi model 

while i do my best to support local busi i know that that the busi i support are good whi wast dollar on a busi when they have a mediocr product and or servic while the servic at buzzberri was noth special i was floor when we ask where they sourc their coffe three teenag someth just stood there and stare at us blank you see buzzberri tout it self as local smallbatch artisan coffe and 100 fruit smoothi so youd think that they would have a sell line tell us all about the coffe theyr proud to serv ultim one of the three said where they get their coffe from but onli after moment of debat as someon who love and buy artisan product i felt that this was pretti much unaccept 

so perhap im be to harsh on them they have onli been open a month and they are super close to the our homestead though as i sit here sip on my doubl espresso i figur that they were the one be a littl harsh bitterive been some what apprehens write this review about the buzzberri coffe  smoothi  well my apprehens turn into procrastin becaus i sooo want to support this small busi by write them a stellar review but after repeat mishap and poor servic dure differ visit ive come to the conclus the buzzberri is what it is  meh ive experienc better  

good great locat drive thru coffe and espresso is ok  averag smoothi are made with organ fruit and they offer sever energi and nutrion sup if you like that kind of thing  the decor is cute and whimsic  

not so good the ice tea is elf servic  it sit in an urn for who know how long befor they brew more  it alway tast a littl stale and sort of bitter  they have wifi howev it password protect so you have to request the password  some of the comfi seat has too much wear and need to be replac  

bad  ugli the servic here suck especi for the price they charg mayb it my time but everi time ive been to the buzzberri there are these realli young and uncar girl work  they are not attent to their custom nor do they seem to care about this busi becom success  clean  this place need a good clean  we did not enjoy our last visit for all of the crumb dirt and what not on the floor and tabl  oh yeah and the girl behind the counter are busi yap away at each other rather than pick the place up i can better coffe for less at 32  shea

mi last visit i ask to speak to the mgr or owner and i was told she was not in  i ask them to speak to anyon in charg  both girl state they were in charg so i told them about my disappoint in my repeat visit  they both just stare at me like deer in a hand light  

good luck if you go to tri the buzzberri coffe and smoothidisappoint order the preset packag the tea is serv in a clear pot was cheap look and not even half full  it wasnt hot enough either   the rum cake was absolut aw in smell tast and textur  onli 3 item were decent the scone devil egg and the hazelnut tart  i like the pineappl jam and clot cream 

it was a good thing we onli order one set for the both of us  we would have order anoth pot of tea but we were so turn of by the food item  ive had better afternoon tea elsewher for cheaper evenum clear mani of you have never had real mexican food

mi best friend rave about this place ever sinc i told her i was move to vega from california and need to discov new mexican restaur to help curb my insati crave she mention how much she love lindo so i gave it a shot  but girl you are trippin

lindo michoacan is overpr bland and flavor were just flat out weird the salsa lack that kick that i love and expect from fresh made salsa the decor was a chain restaur nightmar howev portion were big if you like that kind of thing and the view is quit beauti 

the search for delici mexican food in vega continu pleas ani suggest are welcomi am not a huge fan of this place i feel it is all hype serious the pie i have tri were averag and tast and everyth is abov averag in price the restaur itself is warm and invit with brick wall and red and white checker tabl cloth but it feel like a scam when they bring out the pie and then the inflat bill at least i was with good friend this night

th food is noth to write home about at all ive had the antipasto salad which was ordinari the white pizza with garlic and sausag and onion as top pleas tell me i am not the onli one who feel these pie are dri im not an extra sauc kind of girl but we have alway had to ask for a side of sauc with the pizza sausag is tasti i will give them kudo for that ive also had pizza with red sauc and sausag it still seem sauc defici bread basket it might as well be wonder bread it was lack in fresh flavor and flare 

they get two star for serv booz and for decent servic that it id rather microwav totino pizza roll in the comfort of my own home than be seen at grimaldi againim review yet anoth fast food restaur and it not becaus im total into greas but becaus im admit over critic of attent to detail in these drivethru place becaus hello your drive through usual drive away and your too far from the restaur to remedi the situat when you notic they foul up i work at a restaur with a drivethru when i was in high school that was run by a tough whipwield famili who taught us that you dont make mistak you just dont you take step to ensur that you are not miss anyth becaus no one want to drive back to bitch when mistak are made 

with that said not onli was a special order acknowledg but not follow through we receiv no ketchup for not one but two order of french fri no straw for a soda and they charg me an extra 27 cent for a side of sweet and sour which they didnt put in the bag now while i realiz that these are minor item and to some i may be perceiv as a petti crank with too much time on my hand if this is the way you need to drink your soda while you drive with a straw it complic thing if you like ketchup with your fri and at 99 of everi other drivethru in the countri you dont have to ask for it your in for an unpleas surpris and pay extra for someth you dont receiv is realli dumb 

onto the food 
i rememb back when i was a young whippersnapp that mcrib was awesom as long as you dont lift the bun and look at it your golden while it hasnt shrank like everyth els it seem they now skimp on the sauc in a big way and let face it it the sauc that make the sandwich this suck the poor old smooshedtogeth mcrib just isnt that great anymor or mayb my cranki wrinkledup orneri tast bud have chang or mayb ive final woken up and realiz that no one should ever be eat this kind of food for ani reason whatsoev 
im sure it a combin of the threei post a review of lola after my first visit and was ask to take it down becaus some peopl thought it was too harsh

iv given it four chanc now

and i have to say i am disappoint with lola i have been on the hunt for a chill coffeehous in my neighborhood where you can work and sip coffe and occasion chat with your neighbor i live in right on roosevelt street and was hope lola would be that  but it realli lack the ambianc i am look for the coffe was alright the espresso shot tast like they were burnt the croissant i had was dri out 

but the vibe is what was realli lack for me i left after 45 minut i would rather be in my own hous  in my own space i think the owner was in when i came in onc and he didnt even make eye contact or greet custom  noth i think that whi lola is lack an authent vibe

it is an intim space and the decor is nice but be in there put me in a bad mood too mani wannab hipster and pretend  and that includ the inappropri dress and over tattoo barista behind the counter ok youv got fake boob we see them alreadi i dont need to see them so intim you may also want to get a pair of jean that fit so i dont have to see five inch of butt crack while your get my coffe and dude have ink doesnt make you hip be abl to be engag and interest make you hip and the sour look dont help

i realli want to like lola but everi experi ive had at lola has been full of the attitud that i hope to avoid in an independ coffe shop 

veri disappointive been here 3 time for a group happi hour 

the first time it was excel  had a great waiter who stay on top of thing and even came over to remind us about happi hour end and to see if we want ani more drink order so he could get them in befor the cut off

th second time it was a bit wors  we had a larg group and took up the entir patio  howev there was onli 1 waitress for about 40 of us  she forgot order brought out wrong thing and had no idea who order which thing  she overcharg me too mani drink that had alreadi been paid for

but sinc they have decent food and great price dure happi hour we decid to come a third time
appar the manag didnt appreci our busi becaus he immedi ask when we would be leav  he said that we take up the entir patio and no one els can sit out there becaus we take all the seat  mind you everi singl person there is a custom  everi singl one of us order multipl drink and plenti of food  it not like anyon was just sit take a seat but not pay for anything
thi manag was so rude that my cowork debat leav right then  we will definit not come back again  we also do a fund raiser with them and our school onc or twice a year  we are plan on cancel that

they have lost our busi now which is unfortunate


if you have a larg group go elsewher  if you are look for cheap drink and there onli a few of you this is an okay place  the pretzel are cheap and okay noth special

mi major compliment is that they have wyder pear cider which is my favorithad a fun uye gettogeth with brian s  norm r today to give this littl venezuelan cafe a tri  i had a carn esmechada patacon which is a sandwich with slice of plantain for the top  bottom fri crisp  a plantain is someth like a huge banana  insid was a moder amount of shred beef  some other thing  it was good but it cost 6  for a fullsiz meal you would have to add a coupl of other thing in the 4 rang  end up at about 15 for your lunch

for half the price i would give it twice as mani starthis restaur has an overal comfort atmospher and the server are gracious and attent  the thai ice tea and ice coffe were delici as was a starter of cucumb salad the main part of the meal my friend and i had was far from memor though the appet sampler had veri dri coconut shrimp over fri almost burnt crab puff dri sweet potato fri though the veggi roll were ok the chicken satay was also ok although the peanut sauc lack garlic flavor and had an over homogen textur the pad thai was subpar and had a slight off aroma after eat some of it i had to stop becaus the experi was unpleasur we mention these to our server who apolog and explain that it was the main chef day off and that our food did not reflect the usual qualiti of the restaur fare hope on our next vist well have a better dine experi one that will be close to what most other review here have experienc so stay tune for an updati would have given 115 star had the manag not tri to make it up to me and my parti for the bad servic by comp a few dish despit that i would rather have paid full price and gotten excel servic 

there are too mani great restaur in las vega to choos from my bad experi here has guarante that i will not be spend my money here again 

it a beauti restaur with low light and lot of dark wood it reflect the design in aria which i love a lot veri chic and minimalist but veri stylish 

the food here was excel veri good tast food howev it took forev to come out and our mushroom side which probabl take the least amount of time to cook came at the veri end after we were finish with everyth els doesnt make sens to me

our waiter was nice but after he took our order he seem to have pull a vanish act we didnt see him at all until we ask a busboy to find him for us he was forget i ask for straw 3x and he final got me one but i had ask for 4 he came back with 6 more 

what annoy us even more was that we were tri to enjoy our meal and the busboy remov our plate and dish without ask first we werent even done with our food geeez just becaus we want to take our time to eat savor the food and just chill doesnt mean were done we were convers and eat at the same time we dont want to stuff our face right away like a bunch of pig just becaus we put our fork down doesnt mean were done eat my friend had to stop the busboy from take her plate by push his hand away

so after they remov our dish and utensil anoth dish came out they total forgot to give us new utensil how the hell were we suppos to eat our bolognes with our hand we had to hail someon down after wait for a while just to ask for fork realli 

for a restaur such as this i realli expect a lot more the servic wasnt even averag it just suck i give credit to where credit is due this place doesnt make the cut for me your better off dine somewher els tri julian serrano or beso much better51910

didnt realli care for the interior and the tabl outsid werent beckon either  it was veri antisept and cold indoor with onli the menu handwritten on the chalkboard the plainlook pastri display case devoid of ani ornament or even a sign of ani effort in make everyth insid present and what look to me an antiquelook espresso machin on the counter to lend decor to the allwhit interior  it was also veri noisi indoor despit the fact that there were onli a hand of peopl  

order the mascarpon and fig jam on marbl rye 4 and the lox w cream chees and tomato 8 or 9 as well as a latt no sugar  the coffe came in a paper cup whi  made me feel like she want me to leav  love the mascarpon and fig  so much so i soon acquir a jar of organ fig jam from whole food but i need to find good marbl rye toast  the lox howev was disappoint  while i found the flavor palat i thought the lox strip were too thin i had lox at true food kitchen that were wildcaught and larger for onli a coupl of dollar more and the cream chees rectangl look strang with it right angl after see such a love present done w the mascarpon and fig jam  made me wish id had two set of the toast

it was nice to see that they still roast the coffe bean onsit  i wish noth but success to toast but i wont be go back at least not for a good long whilenot a fan of jimmi john and find noth gourmet about their sandwich the locat on mill has a bad set up the door to the counter is onli about 5 feet so when it get busi custom tri and pile in then the peopl behind the counter are constant yell for them to move out of the doorway it a mess also the seat is great for 1 or 2 peopl but bring more than that and you are sol 

i realli dont like that there is not 4 option onli 8 im not hungri enough to eat an 8 sub for lunch i want option i order the italian night club and didnt read the menu close enough to see they includ mayo on it i hate mayo my sub was drench in mayo serious like a pond of mayo gross i couldnt tast ani vinaigrett who ever heard of put mayo on an italian sammi i think ill stick to silver mine should i need to get  my mill sub fix oni wish i could write this place two review becaus the differ between when you go is like night and day might as well be two differ places

weeknight are great this is the place to loung around on their beauti patio with a glass of wineor three and amaz small plate a great spot for warm summer night servic was impecc and price were perfect plus the staff actual know their stuff when it come to their wine and what to recommend 

but then there the weekend
mad the mistak of take the husband on a friday night and we didnt even stay for a drink appar this is the place for the chandler cougar crowd and the 4050 someth act like bnoxious 20 year old i hate to general but when you walk in and get the stink eye from three 60 yr old ladi in mini skirt it hard encourag affect we walk in and the place was pack it a bar on a weekend that to be expect but there was no one around with a wait list and the place isnt set up to have a lobbi or realli even a host stand all i could assum was that it was a free for all seat plan and we didnt feel like wade through the mob of  soccer dad in afflict shirt to tri to reach the bar 

definit cant recommend on the weekend and if you do attempt it keep in mind that there is absolut noth els in the area as far as bar or nightlif so you may be stuck trekk it into chandler or temp to find someth els to do as for me im not so sure im go to risk head out there anywher near a weekend unless the vibe chang drasticwere you around dure prohibit and do you miss the drink of that era the answer is most like no sinc youd have to be in your eighti or nineti to rememb it and i dont think anyon that age read my blog if you never had the chanc to experi the drink popular dure prohibit and would like to howev i suggest you go to herb and rye not for the food definit not for the food but for the drink which are terrif in fact your not limit to drink that were popular dure prohibit but can enjoy the whole american histori of drink from the gothic age of american drink 17751865 to it reviv 1990present no matter what you choos im sure youll be happi ive tri three the frisco from the gothic age i dont even like whiskey the scofflaw from prohibit i dont like bitter and the diablo from the reform year gotta love tequila each has been except but i dont review cocktail i review food

mi husband and i have now been to herb and rye three time we were disappoint the first time somewhat less disappoint the second in fact we walk out after drink and calamari the first time when we were with my parent becaus it took forev to not get our food you might be ask yourself whi would you go back a second time let alon a third time  well there are sever reasons

1 we had been anticip the open of a new restaur ever sinc they close and we saw a new sign go up though that realli just a reason to tri it a first time i suppose
2 everi new restaur deserv a chanc to work out the kinks
3 it close to home
4 we hadnt yet had a chanc to tri their 50 off happi hour and 50 off food is great way to get you back in the door 57pm and late night mf

the meal alway start out fine the drink as i mention are spot on and the bread is good made all the better by sweet honey butter the server are pleasant but then you order and you waitand wait i understand the time it take to make the cocktail brown stir white shaken but there is no excus for the food take so long when there are a maximum of two other tabl the calamari 750 with happi hour pictur abov this time was much better than the first so i was glad to see the improv the idea was good peperoncini crispi pancetta and aoli drizzl but somehow it end up as a fair uninterest salti mass perhap i am be too harsh it wasnt so bad and the portion was larg if you like that kind of thing i suppos the most disappoint aspect was that it was a vast improv a long while after it left our tabl we got our vitello a la fiorentina a veal tbone 18 with happi hour which wasnt a tbone at all our waiter admit he had forgotten to tell us that the chef had chang it to a chop which would have been fine if it was good but it wasnt although it was cook well i dont think we were abl to get more than six decent bite out of it that werent ultrafatti between the two of us the mash potato underneath werent hot and didnt have enough butter and the asparagus was complet void of season forget about the caramel lemon and white bean ragout if you can even call it that if wed been pay the full price of 36 i definit would have complain what am i say i complain anyway the chef took it off the bill almost make me feel bad for be so negat in this review ala a critic job isnt alway an easi one

th chef truli isnt the onli one to blame for the immin demis of this restaur howev the decor is the dine room is suppos to make you feel like you are in old vega but fall short in everi way the red felt wallpap fake leather booth tini chandeli cheap silverwar and fake bookcas all add to the depress ambianc the worst abov all is the music it is more outdat than the drink and is truli nauseat i mean im sure suwanne river had it day but it 2010 now ian put it well i think im go to slit my throat with this butter knife if i have to listen to this anymor wait i said let me finish that honey butter first

overal im not sure the 50 off menu even make it worth come here i would truli like to see this restaur continu to make improv becaus they have a realli great thing go with the bar it would have been smarter of them to open up a much smaller place that focus on great drink and serv a few except tapa rather than invest 16 million in this huge bore place the young new owner unfortun invest everyth he had my suggest is to stay in the bar and order the drink order lot of drink that way the music probabl wont bother you as much who know you may even start sing alongthere this commerci order a medium or larger drink and get an egg and chees english muffin for 99 seem like a good deal to me and i was hungri this morn besid dunkin has been make great stride in qualiti and servic right that what the market would have you believ anyway so i order from the drive thru and pay 315 for a medium ice coffe and the aforement egg and chees english muffin servic is swift i drive away readi to dig into my sandwich on the park lot that is the 101 that when thing get ugli my sandwich is cold like you can feel how cold it is through the paper bag i cant eat it main becaus im afraid it will sicken me in some way  i dont screw around with egg and yes im still hungri 

so sorri dunkin your market gal is a genius but this store did not deliv shame on me for believ that silli market ployif you want be told how to drink your coffe this is the place for you  i love the fact that they roast their own coffe etc  great  but three thing frustrat me

1  my pregnant friend want a decaf americano with a half of a shot of espresso  the baristra refus to make that  when we ask whi we were told becaus it would ruin the tast  so although the custom want it that way they refus to make it  we were told it had to be entir caffein or decaffeinated

2  there is no sugar or sugar substitut anywher in the place  after they refus to make my friend her drink i didnt want to ask about the sugar and get a lectur about whi i could not have ani to put into my coffee

3  they have veri nice look giant cooki  and the cooki tast great  but it was still raw in the middl  kinda crappi when it cost over 2

i got an ice coffe which was goodless bitter than normal ice coffe  but between the rap music blast not the most sooth coffe shop choic but doe work with the name of the shop and the lack of give the custom what the custom want attitud i think i wont be go to this place again  

i love suggest about how to enjoy drink and appreci my coffe  but if i want to ruin my coffe let me do iti am go to tri to be as fair as possibl  i have eaten lunch here quit a few time and while the food is veri good the servic leav someth to be desir  the waitress who i understand is the owner daughter is at best frazzl and overwhelm and at worst rude and incompet  

unfortun there are not a lot of choic in las vega if you are look for a high tea  the four season is except but expens  the bellagio offer it in their petrossian bar if you dont mind an unhealthi help of second hand smoke with your tea

chef carolin is great and friend and her presenc after the meal has save a coupl of my dine experi although one can onli overlook poor servic for so long as it is a signific part of ani restaur experiok anoth up market hot dog jointgood enough hot dogsrow of beauti state of the art condiment dispens love tabl and décorand i am just not get it

i like hot dog as much as the next red blood all american boymayb morebut i do not understand how these place can make it on dogsin fact i dont think they can

it seem that these new upscal kind of hot dog joint have a menu that stop just of short of be a fox restaur conniptioneveryth from yam fri to prime rib dip on the menu

but i came in for a hot a dog and a hot dog is what i gotfor 265 us dollars

it was a particular necessari and poignant retox for menot onli did i get in a nice run this morn but i had to go to the arizona mvd to final complet the process of get new tag for my cara process that took over 4 month and more than 25 hour of my time on the phone and wait at the mvdwhich is anoth review about the adequaci or lack thereof of the data process system process and employe of the state of arizona motor vehicl division

i celebr final emerg from the gantlet bloodi and scar but unbowedwith a hot dog

th hot dog themselv are reason price pretti well prepar serv on littl loav that have been toast and butter i think you know that in my world buttergoodness

i look around and they dont seem to tout ani particular type of sausag or wiener manufactur you knowlik schreiner or schuyler or import from buffalo ny or special made from babi seal scrotum or somethingbut the wiener were certain serviceable

th servic was also servic but was more like a standard hot dog standnot the most person group behind the counterand if you are tri to upsel to justifi the rent and the build out of the space in a mall like thisyou just might need a littl personalitya well as the abil to do more than ask ja want fri wit dat

fin as i ate my wiener go aheadsnickeril waitdoneok i notic anoth slight off element to the hdsthe music play sound like greek ballad which may be the case sinc i thought the accent behind the counter sound greek and they were play rather loudlyalthough the obligatori flat screen was tune to espn and was also turn upcommit 1st degre cacophony

on set of sound or the othernot bothand by the way sinc when is the background music tune to what the staff or owner want to listen to as oppos to what the custom want to hear

il tell you whenat good old divey cruddi greasi hot dog onli hot dog joint where the radio is play what the cook want and nobodi had better mess with the settings

but that not what hds is tri forthey may need to rethink a coupl of thing if they want rise abov the rest

25 star for an averag hot dog mediocr servic and the odd ambianceand i just dont round upesp after a trip to the mvdsadim pretti sure that this is one of those place where if you are a nonchines asian you get treat bad it a fact that everi singl person of asian descent in the world has some chines blood in them but i think the treatment i receiv here come from more of a nationalist point of view rather than ethnic

when i first move to las vega mani year ago i had no clue where ani of the japanes or korean district were locat las vega is a veri polit incorrect place not onli do the public school teach their student that cuban are from a contin name mexico but the citi hall decid to declar everyth on spring mountain chinatown they even declar the korean japanes and vietnames district as chines  well get back to subject i ask the ladi work here where i could find a good ramen hous or korean bbq and she start make these angri scream nois at me she then said that she refus to answer the question 

all the review below are like hrey dis is wer i go fur mei azn fud shoopingtransl hey this is where i go for my asian food shop now that quot bother me the term asian is too broad and general can i realli do my japanes food shop here not realli unless you count nissan ramen can i realli do my korean food shop here no fcking way you guy are as mix up as floyd mayweath when he told manni pacquaio to go back to the japan and make some sushiit pain me to lower my rate for illeg jack but it has to be done

i return here last week for a friend birthday and while i do enjoy the relax surround i came away veri disappointed

sinc my last visit jack have done someth which put them in the same boat as compani like ryanair they have start do add on so you look at the menu and think yum i think i will have a burrito that is £650 oh wait you have to add an extra 75p on to that to put beef in your burrito that translat as pay £650 for a tortilla with some rice and bean not cool whi cant you just buy a burrito for £650 whi not includ the beef in the price i realli dont think a tortilla rice and bean is worth £650 then the sneaki assist behind the counter ask if you want sour cream and jalapeno in the same way that they ask what type of salsa and bean you want there is no mention at the extra cost your £650 burrito quick turn into cost you £1010 with a cup of coke 

the burrito is huge but you quick realiz it is made up of most rice and bean with veri littl beef it is all rather tasteless and bland and the realize that it cost over a tenner make it wors i want to love this place becaus the idea is brilliant but i think the price do not reflect the qualiti or flavour of the foodmayb some outrag good texmex experi have made me a littl jade or mayb all the review on here made me hope for too much but this was simpli not all that great sure the burrito and quesadilla the two dish my wife and i tri are huge but the fill are bland and mushi and ad extra top to fix the tast issu will quick make thing even more overpriced

thi simpli isnt good texmex kudo for tri  the guacamol wasnt bad  but right now all youll find here are some lifeless rice bean and tortilla wish for a bit of spice and a whole lot less musheeeehhhha group of us came here on a saturday to take advantag of the patio and our beauti weather and ill admit i was so so disappoint im complet shock it has such killer reviews

on they dont have high chair big slap in the face as a parent if im be honest you do know you lose a custom when you so blatant tell them their children arent welcomeyou know that right not all children are misbehav nuisanc and if i want to bring my kid out with me for a nice afternoon lunch in which we all enjoy ourselv then i will and you will have a high chair and you will not rude tell me we dont have those when i ask for one becaus then i get on yelp and do crazi thing like use too mani exclam point so take a risk and order the damn high chair also let me now point out that there were sever dog on the patio so i can bring my dog to slobber and shed and just be gross all over while im eat but i cant bring my child of highchairsittingage

r over

ahem where was i 

two the server were rude slow and all around unpleas not a good vibe when your tri to relax oh wait i bet it was my crazi kid make everyon grumpi we had to wait a good 10 minut after sit down for someon to clean our tablebr us menuseven notic we were there turn out half of our group didnt want to dine here becaus of said aw servic but they didnt mention it until after we were there and seat 

three the food is alright but not great the coney is still good though im not sure it the best per the new time and the mac and chees is just alright i person prefer windsor the hus order the veg and he said it was one of the worst veget sandwich hes ever had im not sure whi offer a decent veget sandwich is so difficult for mani restaur in phoenix 

four ambienc there was none no music was play the tabl and chair were flimsi with no place settingsdecor there no art or plant or realli anyth insid or out 

i probabl wont ever be back to tmi becaus frank there are just so mani other place that are way better 

i understand i went total nut and that not offer high chair doesnt mean they dont welcom children but realli come onwhat happen i hate write bad review more than anyth becaus i love promot local busi i hate write bad review for restaur ive previous had amaz experi at even more 
    to say the least custom servic here at least last night was horrend we arriv at peak dine hoursaround 630 and knew we wouldnt be abl to glide right in to a tabl so a wait was understand the first hostess was friend enough and told us it would be about an hour and a half to two hour wait we order drink from the bar realli good the el diablo and the beer shandi and snag seat at the outdoor bar the bartend was a littl arrog and sarcast which could definit put some patron off but whatev i had a good drink and can handl some snarki comment 
    what kill me was when i went to check on our posit in the line around 830 i walk up and all three hostess were stand there talk and act like i was intrud in on their convers she told me it would be anoth forti five minut to an hour hadnt we alreadi been sit and wait for 2 hour i was annoy and put off by this we decid to leav the bar and stand in the lobbi to my distast i watch as the main hostess greet three men and when they ask how long the wait would be she respond everyon is cancel it shouldnt take long i get it young hostess want to flirt with cute guy but cmon custom are stand right in front of you that have been for much longer than it wont take long 
      final seat at 9pm the food was delici and our waitress was speedi and friend what a shame that i left with a bad tast in my mouth and an even bigger shame for my friend that i brought who had never been here befor not a great first impress for herive heard some buzz about two hippi beach hous so when i happen upon it at lunch time i thought i would give it a try

first of all there werent ani hippi run the place  instead there was two love ladi one at the front counter and the other cook the food  they were both veri nice and help   

i order the 3 taco special opt for a fish taco a chicken taco and a carn asada taco  i also order a diet coke which was hand to me in a can

mi order number was call out and i reciev three larg tinfoil packag  i thought that was a good sign that they were so big

howev ive never realli been a huge fan of eat out of tinfoil or off of red tray so that where the experi began to turn south

th taco were fill with rice bean and the chosen meat along with fresh grate chees and chop cabbag  they were quit big  i wasnt sure if it was suppos to be that way but all of the taco were quit cold and flavorless  the chicken appear like it had come out of a can  it was white and tast boil  there was no flavor at all the carn asada appear to be slow cook beef and tast like  it had been boil in water  again no flavor  then rice and bean were bland  the pinto bean appear like they had just come out of the can

th fish taco had moist chunk of fish and it was actual the best of the three howev the flavor came from the sauc that was on it not from the fish

overal the restaur came far short of the outrag good food that their sign out front tout  there was noth outrag about it and good well the food was not    

the best thing they had go for them was the two ladi who were work there who were veri friend  

two thumb down for this restaurummmsowhat up with the whole goat thing 
has no one els notic the goat theme how has this not been mentioned

seri there a goat head hang on the wall possibl more than one littl goat on the menus and bill book i half expect to look up in the ladi room to find a goat peer over the stall it was creepi and confus i need to understand it
ormayb not

mov forward the food was truli fantast we had the pork belli and devil egg with caviar which were the two standout for me the meatbal dish wasnt bad i just feel as though i could have made it at home with thing i alreadi have in my refriger so all in all noth special

our manhattan were quit good overal but lack consist if there was a next time i would stick to wine

th problem i have with mabel are the following
if this review was base on food alon it would warrant at least 4 star howev the run question between myself and my guy the entir even other than the goat conundrum was whether or not we even saw anyon els order or eat anything
that may not matter much to anyon but whi wast such talent on a place that seem to serv littl more purpos than to be the next drop in for a bunch of 30k douchebag and  their cheap tacki spark dress girlfriend serious ladi and partial tuck gent 1998 call it want it bad tast back have some class i dont need to see your manscap chest or your woman ass cheek hang out of the bottom of her 2999 dress 

i may have been abl to bump the rate up to three star if the servic wasnt  so awkward i cant stand it when a server almost alway femal make eye contact and direct convers to my date onli i dont appear threaten i smile a lot and tri to make eye contact im not go to bite youlook at me 
im a pretti cool chick and id like you to acknowledg my existencethank for some reason this happen to me frequent i wait tabl myself back in the day and i cant wrap my brain around that one but oh well 

all in all the food was excel drink were alright servic was weird if we hadnt alreadi had a tabl from dinner and were forc to stand i could total see myself want to shank some bitch  the whole experi felt a littl twilight zone especi with the goat situat doubt returnscale of 110 singl visit
6 food
7 service
3 atmosphere
7 value

not my first time to pita jungl  just my first time to this one  and im not a fan  it feel wrong  the tabl chair and booth would fit much more at hanni than a pita jungl  sometim nicer isnt alway better  such as when it make the place feel realli weird and like theyr either a tri too hard or b out of touch with their offer and audienc  also the massiv mirror on the east wall hard angl down at all mean that peopl pretti much get a great reflect view of the ceil  for as long as this place was wait to open i just feel like it wasnt done well

th food was middl  my girlfriend was over garlick and mine was blasé  but neither was bad  the vodka tonic she order came in a wine glass  wtf

i like the pita jungl in temp that i can get to via light rail but i unfortun have to pass on this one that walk distanc from my home i usual like this place for a quick cooki fix but this last visit realli frustrat me i have a dont yelp when angri rule so im yelp this almost a week later 

mi mom want cooki came by with a groupon now on my phone and was told that we couldnt use it becaus the cashier didnt know what it was it took about ten minut of me explain that it a coupon for teddi specif a lot of argu and three phone call befor it was honor dure this time i was also told it couldnt be honor because

 hes never seen one before
 the manag wasnt there
 it need to be printed
 i could use it on thursday when the manag was in defeat the purpos of a groupon now right
 he couldnt call the manag again becaus she was busy

whil i inevit got my cooki with my groupon special the energi and effort that went into the use was extrem annoy groupon isnt exact a new concept anymor i tri to be as polit as possibl with the cashier sinc he clear wasnt do it to be a jerk but i do feel that manag should proper alert the staff when they run a groupon so that the staff in the bakeri know what to expecti was veri disappoint by my last 2 visit here on one visit i was serv cold bean and rice like from the fridg cold it took almost 20 minut to get new bean and rice and they were still bare warm no apolog no nothing

w again to get my favorit chicken mole taco and they were bare warm my husband had their marin shred pork in a burrito and got sick after take the first bite this must be an acquir tast it was gross realli gross then i found what look like a gray slimi booger in my rice when i point it out to the server he took my plate away and came back say it was an onion no way was that an onion or even a close relat of an onion no apolog no ask if i want someth els he just came over slam the bill down and said we didnt charg you for your food so dont worri about it and walk away 

i know mistak happen but own up to it and at least tri to make the custom feel good about the situatmy first and last time eat at thai origin bbq  oooooh how dramat  i bet you cant wait to see what disast i incur   well none  i got the right food that i order it was close enough to be avail at the time promis and the servic and price were fine   

no the reason i wont be back is that compar to all of the other qualiti thai offer vega has to offer it simpli wasnt good enough  i will be the first to admit that thai bbq is suffer the affect of be the 21st thai restaur ive tri here in las vega mani of which are outstand in everi aspect  i cant help but compar ani new thai restaur to class act such as weera thai or prommar neither of which is except far from this locat of thai bbq   all that be said let get to it

i call in my order of a chili chicken lunch special becaus it seem closest to what i normal order when i get thai and also becaus of the love photo upload of the same dish in the photo here  no serious look at this beauti dish  https3media2akyelpcdncombphotoibxlicit0rmm6n0tqdgljpg     i was told itd be readi in 15 minut and i arriv probabl a few minut beyond that

upon enter it took a few minut for the solitari server to get my order  it wasnt an extrem long wait and she did seem veri busi wait actual tabl so it didnt bother me  if she was on her phone use snapchat or tumblr or sextor or whatev new app the kid use nowaday id be a littl more bother by this  

got back to my offic and was a littl disappoint in a few thing  1 that pic i post abov  mine look noth like that  the chicken was chop up sloppili and not beauti ground up as you see abov  it was like go to wendi and expect to get that 99 cent burger that can bare fit in wendi mouth on the commerci onli to receiv one that your pet hamster can gobbl in one bite  2 no eggrol   as a matter of fact there was noth but the chicken dish and the rice  now noth extra was promis or advertis but it seem pretti customari for most thai restaur to provid someth with the lunch special besid the discount  if anyth it add a littl valu that i could have use after be charg 2 for my brown rice upgrad   

the food that was provid tast okay but not great  the rice seem a littl mushier than i prefer and as i mention befor the chicken was pretti haphazard chop up   

sorri thai bbq that ultim wind up be worth 2 star  if youd have gotten to me a year ago you probabl would have eek out a 3  where doc brown when you need himafter our 60 breakfast here i can safe say this place isnt worth the hype

when we arriv at 930am there was no wait when we left mayb an hour later there were so mani peopl wait it had to have been over an hour wait let me tell you i would have been piss if i had wait more than 15 minut for this breakfast

drink  i order a watermelon lemonad and bf order a pistachio ice mocha the drink were awesom mine was slight sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasnt too much his pistachio mocha was sooo good i was mad that i didnt order it 

for breakfast both my bf and my bff order the tractor driver combo which is two egg bacon or sausag and a pancak or you can substitut a waffl or french toast for one extra dollar bff got the pancak that thing was bigger than the plate it was serv on and bf got the vanilla waffl 

their egg scrambl were nice and fluffi the bacon was alright his waffl was good but didnt tast like vanilla and her pancak she like but couldnt even eat half of it

mi order  okay you know when you read the descript for someth and then it arriv and you realiz you read the descript all wrong this is what happen to me 

i order the hh origin benedict egg benedict  i expect hollandais and some poach egg whatev els happen is fine but those are the thing i need i read that i would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of mash potato although i didnt know how that would fit in i read about the red pepper cream but i thought that would be along with my hollandais i read bast egg and i honest didnt know what that meant 

so i receiv this massiv red mess with sprig of rosemari and what look like pine needl shoot out the side of my food i get tri to make a plate look nice but this was a bit much

th tast eh the top layer are alright the bast egg is overcook no runni yolk at all but the sauc was okay and the tomato was fine the bottom layer though a dri ass biscuit on top of dri mash potato not a good combo they realli have no busi call this ani sort of benedict sinc they stray away from everi tradit benedict characterist possibl asid from stack everyth on top of each other

ther are mani better place to drop 60 on breakfast at in vega  this is not one i would revisit also appar there was an episod of man vs food film here that must be their claim to fame becaus our waiter mention it at least 5 time wow i am so impressoki like to eat 
i eat a lot 
i like to eat good food 
so far i havent experienc that here 

sure the portion are humong and it dress up all pretti and nice but that just about it  it all styleno substanc yes there all kind of celebr pictur complet with their signatur on the wall endors this place as the best place to eat so did planet hollywood we all know what happen there ill have to agre that it the best place to pig out onli if you can shove all of that mountain of food into your mouth 

i want to like it this time around hope for a better experi but it just fell flat again leav me want more and unsatisfi yes i was stuf but i was still hungri 

doe that make sens 

how is that even possible

they give you a mountain of food but it lack flavor and heart a good exampl is their chicken n waffl how can you mess up chicken n waffles

wellthey use breast meat and deep fri the live sht out of it and what your left with is a dri piec of meat that is hard edibl in this case look is veri deceiv again all style and no substanc just like some of the stuff you see in vega i have to also mention that we had the creepiest server ever he lurk around with his big bug eye who remind me of smeagl on lord of the ring 

mi precious

i also made the mistak of order their mint coffe the onli real mint they had on this was the garnish they place on top the mint they use to have that minti flavor is mint syrup which give it that artifici flavor it over sweet and undrink after a coupl of sip 

yeah i gave it anoth chanc and it time for me to move oneunfortun the price is the best thing here i loveee sushi and when i heard this place was 1499 for lunch i had to check it out stop here for lunch today with my sister and her friend i did not like the server she was just blah no person at all she bare said 2 word to us the whole time we were there she never even said your welcom after we thank her for bring water or our food to me that is just rude server seem to forget their perform affect their tip so if they act shitti they can expect the tip will be as well 

so they dont have the best qualiti of fish but it is decent we tri these rolls
cali in vega 
hawaiian
salmon lover 
imperi 
orang 
sticki icky
maui
mexican which was never receiv 

most of the roll fell apart which is annoy i dont want to have to use a fork while eat sushi ya feel me and none of the roll were great they were all just ok the ponzu sauc on the hawaiian roll tast like straight vinegar it was pretti bad also after read the review today i found out they have dessert it wasnt on the menu and you can bet our sparkl person server didnt mention it never againdark in the citi night is a wire

dodo do do do do do do do do do do do do doa sign pictur of a smile latoya jackson greet you as you enter the staff is friend the restaur is spacious and more than 80 item are offer dessert includ but the food is far from memor a lot of the item were bland  even my favorit fri chicken  and those which were not were sub par even for a buffet and dont bother with the sushi ive come to the conclus that if you dont have a sushi chef prepar the sushi behind a sushi counter it probabl not worth it the establish will probabl surviv though it look like it been there forev and seem to have a loyal custom base from sun citi the perpetu bumpertobump traffic on that part of grand avenu on the drive back to phoenix was a fit conclus for this buffet excursthis nice look midsiz place had 84 main item out as i cheer join a moder crowd of diner on this wednesday morn  unfortun it was all downhil from there  as norm said the food was blah  even with so mani choic i just couldnt find anyth to get excit about at all

mi server was real sweet  one of the star up there is for her  the food was in fact pretti bad

lunch buffet 649 sr 584after live in vega for about a year this is easili the most disappoint high end meal ive had  id give the food a 45 but the servic was probabl a 15

service
th first disappoint was wait  we had a reserv and even so i can understand wait by the bar for a few minut  howev we want far more than a few minut  our leader went up to the front to inquir and they said on someon will be by short to seat you  that didnt happen so we had to check back again and someon gave us the apolog of oh im sorri i thought they came and got you

mayb a miscommun but certain someth that could be excus  howev thing didnt get better from there  it seem like about 10 minut from when we seat until we even got drink menus then anoth 1015 befor the drink arriv  easili 15 minut befor bread arriv at the tabl  it just felt like everyth was so slow  after the first round of drink came our waitress or waitress seem disappear  i mean when you have a tabl of 10 peopl order round of 15 cocktail or better youd figur servic would be fast  i think they easili miss out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service

if you look at the price at mastro and compar it to other place across town you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that know the menu back and forth and can describ all of the star  we got none of that  i would say our servic was at the level of an averag chain restaur  you arent ad ani valu when you ask about menu item and the waitress just list 3 thing that are good  we ask how the steak come and the repli was someth like what do you mean  i mean are they season sauc dri age  there is no explan on the menu or list of sauc or accompani for the steaksoh yeah they are season and broiledthanks

thi was follow up with no descript or explan of ani side  dure the meal we couldnt even locat the waitress and peopl were still anxious to get more drinks

i will say that the food was good  the steak was uniqu in the regard it was so warm when it came out  usual food has somewhat cool but their steak still had a sizzl and was warm for the first few bite pretti good  the asparagus was noth special  the lobster mash potato were good but at 40 can be steep for a side dish  crab gnocchi was good but im not crazi about gnocchi so im not an expert  the problem in vega is that you can find a place equal to mastro food wise with probabl lower price so suffer through bad servic can be a deal breaker

needless to say nobodi order dessert or drink after dinner  with so mani other option in town for steak i probabl wouldnt come back for that  i will say i tri the ahi tuna sashimi which seem great for under 40  i didnt tri it but the swordfish look the same  i would come back if i was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the servic mayb with a smaller parti and a better tabl thing would be betterfor starter i realli want to give this place a great review becaus the food was good but after receiv my bill i just cant do it

our total bill came up to 24323 that not my complaint my complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charg on the card it was for 29188 im glad i kept my receipt

thi prompt a call from me to the restaur today to find out whi there was an addit 4700 charg to my card without disclos it to me the manag told me that the compani they use automat add a 20 gratuiti to the bill 

this was not disclos to us by the waitress it was not disclos on our receipt in fact when i call he said they receiv that complaint at least 5 time a day as if that the normal order of busi fix it if peopl are complain you have no right to charg them an addit 20 without disclos this befor  they eat

tip are voluntari not mandatori unless disclos i leav my tip in cash and i alway cross out the tip line on the receipt  the money isnt the issueit the principl that they have no right to take my money without my permiss that is basic theft 

so now i have to wait 23 busi day for the addit 47 to be refund to my card which mean i wont see my money until tuesday or wednesday sinc we ate there friday night other than this absurd experi with my bill here is a review on the food

1 the custom servic is great except for not disclos that ill be charg an addit 20 even if you leav a cash tip

2 the  crab cake were good but both my wife and i had a small piec of shell noth worth complain about

3 my wife had the blacken ribey it was delicious

4 i had rack of lamb it was delicious

5 twice bake potato was good

6 gorgonzola mac  chees was good

7 clam chowder was good

8 calamari was just ok

9 the complimentari bread was most hard except for the pretzel i dont mind a mix of bread but when the major are hard it just not for us 

overal the food was good but we will not be go back until the chang they polici of charg peopl an addit 20 without their knowledge

if you eat here pay cashim surpris there is not a review alreadi about this street of new york in anthem  but then again most peopl wont complain about there experi and just not go back hens  the purpos of this review 

the good after all there is alway some good in just about everyth  this is an awesom locat in anthem  they are locat in the frys center  they are reason price compar to other place with similar food  they never have a wait to be seat  te food is not great but it not too bad either 

the bad the servic in this place is soooooo slow  whether your din solo with two or as a famili the wait is the same  slowvill x2 the staff is not veri accommod and heaven forbid if someon come in they know while they are serv you  they will make more time for their friend than you  

so whi give them 2 star and not 1 star  becaus the din option in anthem are pathet and i am not a pessimist but rather a critic optimist in hope they will get their act togeth some dayok let me tri this again this is no longer the same roberto that was featur on food network it is def under new manag andor ownership if you go to robertosazcom it onli has the anthem locat list and that actual explain everyth to me the staff here is not friend and there is no one from the old crew here anymor it been like this for awhil now mayb almost a year i kept come back think that mayb with the chang eventu stuff would work itself out and get back to normal that didnt happen here and i gave the place mani mani chanc it realli make me sad after go here for like a decad know it wasnt the same i still kept come back here you know what they say old habit die hard they realli do i was like a kid that kept go back to that mean dog and pull it tail over and over again while end up bit everi damn time 

this was the last straw for me last night i alway order the same thing hereagain creatur of habit they have tri this befor but they usual work with me this time the cashier tri to nickel and dime me where i end up with a 10 burrito are you fuck kid me here the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still end up be wayyy overpr im look for a new place now i learn my lesson and wont wast ani more time on this place get mediocr foodin a two day span i frequent this monument to lard not onc but twice make federico my defunct dinner for two day in a row
how did this happen whi did this happen
thes were question i woefulli ponder as i spent near 34 of a sunday perch upon the porcelain throne evacu my bowel like anderson cooper and his news crew amidst a chaotic tahrir squar 
the onli reason to my mad that i could fathom in the cloud and reek haze i was brew that sabbath day was that i had liter drank or smoke myself retard so much so that my raven appetit overwhelm my better judgement
friday night my mistak was assum that the graveyard shift would care enough to proper cook an adobada burrito at 2 am it honest tast like they dous some chorizo in red chili sauc wrap it in a tortilla and threw it out the deliveri window like an unwant babi in bath water
saturday night for one idiot reason or anoth i order a green chili burrito which id assum would be hard to fuck up appar not this didnt tast like green chili pork perhap itd be more apt to label it as boil pork offal with a splash of tomatillo salsa it was proababl the worst green chili ive had in a long while

i have visit mani kfcs and they are all the same it not just this locat 
absolut not worth the 2100tax for me but worth everi penni for the smile on my mother in law face unfortun i have to do a review updat that is not good for pom cafe i realli realli want to enjoy this place the second time around and give them anoth shot but im total disappointed

first off they got my order wrong and onli sent one sandwich instead of the two i order they just combin the two togeth it didnt even make sense

second when my receptionist got there they left out two item and had to call her back to come pick them up by the time she went back and got the food they forgot to give her everyth arriv back at the offic cold and the bread was soggi the side of crispi tofu we order was not crispi at all 

overal everyon at the offic thought their food was okay but not great  probabl becaus everyth arriv cold and limp and for an 850 egg mcmuffin sandwich im certain hope for better than okay  

i dont plan on go back i am so unimpress with you siri 

i met my homegirl jaim w for dinner after a long and stress day there was onli one tabl with custom when we arriv so i was look forward to a good meal in a relax set what i got was a bland bore meal serv up by some of the worst waitress i have ever had to deal with thank i had good dine company

jaim was alreadi seat when i arriv and the waitress came over fair quick to take my drink order it was all downhil from there  two men arriv short after i got my water and sat at the booth next to us we were both surpris to see one of the waitress take their food order befor take our perhap i had left my menu open too long and they thought we were not readi to order but a good waitress would have check to see if we had ani question this isnt a huge deal i was there to catch up with a friend and wait a littl longer than normal to order just gave us more time to chat

w order our food and went back to our convers our meal came out relat quick and correct i had request no onion in my dish i just wasnt impress with my ginger beef dish at all there was an abund of shred ginger on the plate but the sauc itself was veri bland the steam rice was mushi as well 

bi this time i was out of water also the tabl that was seat when we arriv was done and readi to pay i watch our waitress go to them with their check and take away their plate she went back to get their credit card took it to the cash regist and back to their tabl the other waitress was seat at the regist dure this time at one point she stood up look over the regist at the booth where the men were seat to see if they need anyth and then sat back down not even a glanc in our direct if she had i would have wave at her to get her attent  final jaim got fed up and walk to the regist to request refil this is complet unaccept in my opinion 

thank to the pisspoor servic coupl with the subpar season of my dish i was over my meal while the waitress was intellig enough to see that i had left a lot of my meal on my plate she ask if i need a togo box she was not intellig enough to ask if everyth was ok with the food 

whatev i wont be back

edit to add siri thai was close by the health depart of southern nevada in august of 2013 for recycl rice that is disgust and has ensur i will never step foot in this place again see for yourself here 

httpwwwjrncomktnvnewsdirtydiningdirtydiningdoubledosesirithaiandislandmalaysiancuisine221564581htmlthis was our first stop for fall restaur week 2013 honest i never had much interest in dine at martorano until a coupl friend start to rave about the eggplant stack i love eggplant and i had to tri it when i saw that it was offer on the rw menu it seal the deal

i made reserv for 8 oclock our parti of four was seat prompt we were a bit surpris to find the dine room so empti on a friday night with onli a few diner the music was too loud and so were the movi play on the tv it made convers with our friend a bit challeng 

we got start with an order of calamari 18 it was tender but ani crisp was lost from it be buri in chili sauc i wouldv prefer to dip it the longer it sat it turn to complet mush

they brought over their homemad mozzarella as a special treat and it was was special this was the highlight of the meal for me the mozz was well season with oliv oil and pepper flake insid was layer of salti prosciutto yum

th eggplant stack was up next it was beauti layer with light bread eggplant that was fri crisp fresh tomato mozzarella and arugula i had high hope for this dish but i felt it miss the mark it was terribl underseason and i wish the arugula was basil it might have save it from be so bland

a for the entre we sampl the penn vodka and bucatini carbonara i had the carbonara there was someth signific off about it it lack that luscious mouth feel and as it cool it got gummi and off put to make matter wors a heavi hand of salt was ad to this dish and the pancetta onli made it wors i tri  my husband penn and it too was over salti his was ined to me

bi the time dessert arriv i was die for a sweet bite to refresh my palett from the salti sea tast that linger in my mouth a cannoli and tiramisu were suppos to be the choic but they had run out of tiramisu fortun they were substitut their ny cheesecak thank this was well execut it wasnt over sweet or rich i enjoy it

overal it was an underwhelm experi at least we help out three squar food bank i will add servic was veri attent no complaint therewe stop here for a quick lunch after do some errand and shop the restaur was pretti empti with two other patron there besid us the restaur was clean and well kept and the decor was much more subdu and classier than some of the other hawaiian restaur in town we order two differ combin plate with two scoop of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad the chicken was thin and dri and unfortun the highlight of the meal i couldnt stomach the beef as it had a veri distinct off put odor to it the pork was also dri and had an off put smell i did not want to chanc a food poison so i just ate the chicken and rice the macaroni salad tast like it had been marinad in a clean solut the price is fair for the amount of food you get but in this case i would opt for qualiti over quantiti i dont plan on come backopen letter to the management

ther is someth you seem not to know about your wait staff they tri to take advantag of your custom by round down the chang on a ticket let say a ticket total 1731 and i gave her a 20 and a 10 what should i have gotten in chang whi ani 3rd grader will tell you 1269 broken into 1s and a 5 what i got was 1200 even short me you 069 is this a big deal not onc it not but after have this behavior happen at your establish sever time it has becom a habit with your staff assum the chang to compound this this particular waitress i had call this on her befor i had also inform manag befor and so obvious noth had been done did i get piss off yeah i certain did and admit a bit over the top did a manag both to ask whi i was so upset no 

ok so im 86ed from your littl place plenti of place to eat in vega but you should know that your staff is not as honest with your custom as you would like to think and your rep on the street is reflect of this i had been warn by a former employe of your that this was the insid basebal thing that happen there but i couldnt believ it obvious it was true the shame of it all is unfortun this sort of behavior has spread to other place and i would assum it is the economi that spur this on

th funni thing is when a server bring me my chang round the other way so mayb i get a few cent extra back i usual am sure to tip it back and then some and peopl who know me know i am not a cheap tipper unless you assum the chang and then i am like to leav noth at all see as how youv taken your tip already

so yeah 86 me but be sure to fire your wait staff they are do you a great disservic and now you know what get gossip about your establish a rare thing for manag to learn and id use it if i were you

jb
ne to contact me yelpvisualimpactcomi dont know what all the fuss is about cici pizza

fin gave it a shot and wish that i had not given it a second thought

it not even that cheap if you consid the total after drink are added

th qualiti is just not there of cours not go to find anyth gourmet in their ayc buffet

i guess i am one that prefer qualiti over quantity

th 18 buck or so we spent for two was not worth it by ani means

i am not a fan of chees cover cardboard which is their version of pizza

oh well i tri it now i know what it is all about

lif will go on without ever consum their cardboard cuisin again

enough saidcall in our order at 1235 for pick up they told us itll be readi in 18 minut we arriv at 108  paid for the food we wait and wait and still no food we never realli had an issu with wing stop befor usual when we call in our order we arriv  everyth is readi to go 

at 124 we ask whi we dont have our food yet  it been almost an hour sinc it was call in the ladi went in the back and got our food order appar it was sit there the whole time wow no apolog or anyth 

didnt give them 1 star becaus the food never disappoint wish i could say the same for the staff todaybefor you run me out on a rail i must admit i use the onlin vitamin shopp frequent i love a lot of their product and their price are reason i even use a hemp bodi wash religi and buy my enzym there  though im not as religi about rememb to take them damn better take some ginkgo pill for that 

what i dont appreci is a store with a somewhat snooti attitud when it come to custom servic the tall blond guy act as if he is slum to actual have to answer ani vitamin relat question he is way too busi to deal with hmph peopl and silli ole me not know if it glu co sa mine or glu cos a mine whatev was i think at least i got chondroitin right or he might have kick me out

and yes they are a few help employe there is a kid there who goe out of his way to find answer or check stock but then there a ditzi middl age ladi who forgot to ring up all my item so i had to make two purchas and who didnt bother to ask if id like to sign up and save ani money on my purchas  but the kid did ask on a subsequ visit so chalk one up for youth mayb she should use her employe discount and get some ginkgo pill 

so save a great big hassl and get what you need onlin it will save on a lot of useless purchas  unless it on ginkgo pill   and save you some money as well

and can someon tell me which pronunci of gluscosamin is correctit not often that i write a negat review i usual tri to find the posit and give a place at least an aok i cant realli do that for this sammi unfortunately

first the good i enjoy the lobster bisqu it had nice chunk of lobster in it was serv at a nice justbarelytoohot temperatur ie room to cool down and it was creami and delicious

that was realli the onli enjoy part of the meal we also order a garlic shrimp pizza and a balsam chicken salad i couldnt realli tast much garlic in the pizza actual the pizza overal was just blah while it wasnt terribl it certain didnt match up with pizza ive had previous at other sammi perhap the fact that i was at grimaldi just a few day ago didnt help thing grimaldi own sammi ani day of the week

a for the chicken salad it was a huge portion but it just seem like it was drench in that vinaigrett i couldnt eat much of it befor i had to stop although we had a lot of salad left over neither of us want to take ani of it to go strang enough the server didnt even ask if we want it to go not complaining

speak of the wait staff our server was nice enough but upon enter it took a while befor there was anyon to greet us we werent sure if we should just seat ourselv that just a minor thing but when the overal dine experi is subpar thing like that just stick out

walk into sammi i hadnt eaten all day and was starv walk out i was no longer hungri but i wasnt satisfi either it a shame becaus i rememb enjoy the food at the cmye a few month agomy high from this place has worn off and now come the sad part where you realiz you wont be back

feel kind of embarrass consid my out of town step dad a total foodi tri it and thought it was horribl i couldnt have agre with him more

ord take out was told to give them 20 minut when we got there the food was luke warm onc home it was cold duck taco were drench in sauc the tortilla fell apart when we lift them good but not good enough consid how much we paid for someth we had to eat with a spoon i swear the lobster mac n chees has hard ani lobster last the pizza was extrem greasi and cold make the chees gross the onli posit were the fri and that not say much

it sad caus i was impress with my first visit and the updat was a real bummermy last visit i decid to stay in and eat while i was eat my nacho the girl start sweep the floor start in the bathroom and is head toward me i see stuff start fli in the air im think shes not gonna come sweep that toward me well she did i see fuzz dirt and whatev els fli in the air around my food i glare at her got up and threw my nacho in the trash thank for crop dust my nacho with dirt you idiotwas go over by bookmark for lunch and this was right down the street the four star averag caught my eye so off i went 

locat off of charleston there is onli one driveway go into this red rock plaza so if for ani reason you are tri to escap the polic in your car dont go in here p

as i am go over the menu i see there is a lot of choic the guy behind the counter suggest i get the 599 combo what that i ask he mumbl someth about half a sandwich a side and a drink i said nope i was want a full sandwich damnit

so i go with the italian which has cappacola salami ham montadella provolon onion tomato lettuc oil n vinegar salt n pepper and oregano on italian bread sound good right nooooooooo 

the bread to meat ratio was rather larg the bread itself didnt seem fresh and there was a lot of it if you refer to my pic the overal size of the sandwich is most bread the meat didnt seem much i think dude forgot to put oil and vinegar for i dont rememb my tast bud ever tast ani when i got done i still had some bread left over after run out of what like 3 or 4 kind of meat i think total i paid was 8 and some chang 

the place is pretti big with enough tabl and chair for about 40 people

custom servic was ok dude did his job noth extraordinary

a i was leav i couldnt help but think of how this place could averag 4 star to be fair if i just happen to make anoth visit and my experi is better then i will updat this review accord sorri heidi i was not impressed

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 28this review is a bit late  my last real visit was about 6 month ago
 
coupl of thing ive never been here befor 10 pm so i dont know how the ambianc is then  i also have never eaten here except onc have the chowder  

not much to review here  noth realli impress me about this pub  place is dead after 11 pm and by the look of the park lot dure the day it pretti much a morgu dure the day too  

i have never had an issu with their staff be rude onli thing that i have notic is that if your not a regular your almost forgotten  the last time i was here the bartend check on me onli onc  if you dont belong or not a regular be prepar to be look for anoth bar by the end of the night  

reason for the late review is becaus i recent walk in and was not greet  no big but after i sat i wasnt even ask if i want anyth  less than 2 minut and i was out of hereattend spafitfindercom launchaz finest honore benefit the cystic fibrosi foundat tonight  the event itself seem success the bar was pack the servic was slow but understand howev no one from spafitfind came around to introduc himselfherself and to elabor on the site servic  inde the server who handl vs and my drink all night a 10 per person net donate drink coupon for a mojito dlish and a beerwin and a sweet goodi bag wore a spafitfind shirt but did not offer up ani info on it servic neither  while i wouldnt ever go back to the bar too noisi i never like to shout at the person sit next to me to be heard or order the 11 turkey club again this was a basic deli sandwich made w turkey cranberri chutney mayo smoke bacon mmm bacon avocado slice and alfalfa sprout on toast hawaiian bread but it noth to write home about had v and i gone to fez w the 11 we wouldv been in heaven munch on a delici burger and some perfect sweet potato fri but i may give urban 7 martini kitchen a second chanc to redeem itself on the food a foodi cowork of mine rave about  i can say the martini i had were good  love the mojito and the inhibit someth vodka peach schnapp and cranberri juic minus the cranberri juic and instead club soda and sour  didnt care for the hous pinot grigio  i will say that the jalapeno and oliv tapenad bruschetta and the grill marin skirt steak skewer were tasti fyi the nois level was a lot lower at the resto but the band while they play pleas music did get loud at the end  also the servic was quicker  appreci the fact that our server was honest in tell me that he hadnt tri the dessert id ask him about  other lessconscienti server wouldv gush about how it was their fave item off the menu to make the sale  kudo to anthony

among the goodi bag offer were an 8 oz philosophi foam bath and shower cream easili 8 retail trialsiz facial product a wine stopperpour a 20 off fooddrink at urban 7 and a 20 off coupon for yelper john hs massag servic  nice consid that im a power yelper and this was a yelp event youd think theyd cut me a bit of slack for be 3 minut late and serv some kind of food to me  not even an offer for a drink a glass of water a spare cracker i guess i cant kill this place with a one star rate becaus it is part my fault for be late and i havent even tri their food but good servic is a crucial key to ani success establish and this place drop the ball

what realli shock me was that i shook the hand of the managerpartown there and she still turn me away sorri the event end at 8 you can come by when we open this friday she said with a smirk

oh well at least i had good compani so what did my fellow yelper think of the mac meh was the general consensus actual you wont see me here this fridayfish and chip awesom  servic was realli bad realli realli bad  oh and the hostess was rude bitchi and one of those girl who think shes realli hot but in all actual has a butter face you know who you are i know i shouldnt expect much of vega and i general dont but say hello in the first fifteen minut of me be here and i will be fine  everyth took forev and the server was a vacant retard not tri to offend anyon but serious this dude was an idiot  i dont know what it was mayb i was piss off becaus my famili was irrit but the onli thing that is worth come for is the fish and chip if they didnt have these i might have burnt the place down

5 star for the fish and chips
2 star for the hostess
2 star for the service
1 star becaus i dont like have too mani 1 star review on my yelpi am not a hater i just tell it like it is

bottom line  2 starcame here not too long ago and my first impress were good it has a great design and quit a cosi place howev the major downpoint is fair expens drink and bad servic the staff insist on tabl servic which is okay but not when your wait for the bartend to finish their dinner so you get ask if you want anoth one i felt like i was wait for age tri to make eyecontact with the waitress also when a parti has alreadi start a dinner bill i wasnt eat though it get complic when you get the massiv bill at the end 
they should have a system like this 

 go up to bar
ord drink
pay for drink
tak drink to tabl or allow them to take drink to you if they realli want 

voila that in itself would easili notch this place up a coupl pointthe more i think about it the more i realis i dont particular enjoy under the stair i feel like i should but ive been go less and less and when i do go i come away disappointed

it full of mismatch old arm chair it like an extend live room comfi and cosi there quit tasti food and an interest invent rang of cocktails

ther are also rude staff and in particular i think a rude manag with a bizarr tabl servic onli polici as other review have note rather than polit help custom realis this you can get rude ask to sit down befor order your drink  although sometim when it busi you can order from the bar but no one tell you this whilst you sit for an age without a drink

th memori of the visit i had here in which i ask for sweet potato fri with my fish off the daili special menu onli to be told veri rude i could not and if i want sweet potaot fri id have to order the burger our whole tabl of 6 was left stun and appal at the manner the waiter  manag had told me this meant i havent eaten there sinc read my previous review below

but i have sinc been for cocktail i found the window seat to smell of mouldi cabbag im guess just mould and the cocktail just dont seem to have ani kick to them theyr invent but they fail to get me even slight buzz im guess there is alcohol in them but perhap it the ratio of ice that just mean theyr quit weakso have you heard the news they have an oven that cook food at 1000 degre which mean that food get cook faster wrong 

i am not sure if they are still tri to iron out the kink but on a tuesday at lunch we wait 40 minut for our mediumrar burger that rightit took 40 minut to throw the meat in the oven for about 1 minut per side what the cook in the back were do dure the other 39 minut i am not suremayb a smoke break the other thing we found to be iron about the long wait is that they onli have 3 salad 3 burger a chicken sandwich and fri on the menunoth too complicatedwer they confus back there 

the owner were run around the restaur talk to peopl but our server made herself pretti hard to find come by just onc between take our order and the 40 minut wait when we did get our food it was drop off by one of the owner who apolog for it take so long that was nice but couldnt you have comp us some fri as this point 

we got both the duck fat fri and the herb fri the herb fri had good flavor but they were realli soggi i think they may have cook them in the first 10 minut of get our order and then they sat for 30 minut i also thought that the serv size was quit small for the 4 price tag i was expect great thing from the duck fat fri but i was quit underwhelm they were basic wedg of potato that had been roast in the oven and garnish with shave parmesan they werent soggi like the other one but i wouldnt realli call them fri either the burger were cook as request to mediumrar and the bun were nice and soft the meat was good but it fell apart realli easili make for a veri messi burger 

i check out the restroom as well which are two unisex singl user stall they are sleek like the rest of the restaur interior but they have one major flawno toilet paper roll holder they just have roll of toilet paper sit on the back of the toiletgross 

i probabl wont go out of my way to make it back to the grind there are just too mani other burger place out there right now and they dont have near enough varieti to eat there on a regular basi i know that innout get away with the concept but at 150 per burger that is accept not at the 10 a la cart price tag at the grindnot bad  

we move to az from bangkok and my wife is thai and a superb cook to boot so were kind of a tough crowd as far as thai food goe  most of the thai food weve had in arizona has been absolut dread  this wasnt that bad but it not all that special either  

when we saw the yelp review of this new restaur we were anxious to check it out  lao food is also the food of issan as northeastern thailand is call where the peopl are most ethnic lao or khmer 

anyway laoissan food is kind of like the soul food of thailand  down home earthi super spici and veri delici  also veri hard to find anywher in the state outsid of la or vega  

we scan the menu for a long time search for the laoissan compon but that did not appear to exist  we ask the waitress  who couldnt speak thai by the way  where the lao food was and she said it was all mix in  uhmmm oki doki  basic it all 100 thai food  as was everi singl other thing in the restaur not that there anyth wrong with that but we were kind of gear up for some nice spici lao food  that wasnt go to happen

th menu is a pretti standard thaiamerican menu sad there wasnt even one of the classic laoissan dish  just the usual stuff

w opt for the drunken noodl pad kee mao and yam woon sen both tradit thai dish   both were okay by american standard not particular spici even though we had order them that way  neither dish had fresh chili  the yam woon sen was more of a laab with woon sen noodl but it was alright  the drunken noodl were okay  again not near as spici as they should be  

that littl fourjar condiment tray isnt some laothai innov that a kreung prung a standard thai noodl shop item that found on everi tabl in thailand  it suppos to supplement the fresh chili in a dish not supplant them  the dish need to have fresh chili cook in them as well not just crush dri chili ad on top

th real problem is that honesttogood thai food just isnt accept to american  too salti too sour too fishi too spici  so it can onli surviv in communiti like la or vega where there is enough of a thai popul to support it with exclus thai patrons

anyway big portion although a tad expens with virtual everyth on the menu over 10  if your hungri and in the neighborhood it okay but i wouldnt make a special trip

if you realli want to have tradit thai food your best bet is to get invit to one of the thai templ on a festiv day when all the older thai women bring homecook foodoh stingray i have such a loveh relationship with this place

i love their happi hour monday through friday from 3pm  7pm everyth is dirt cheap you could get a coupl roll and sake bomber and edamam for under 15 i love the decorstyl of the place  veri lanysanfranish 

howev what good is a happi hour and restaur fashion if the sushi is subpar and the servic is slow this is where they lost me the waitress are pleasant but it take forev to get your food check water etc and the restaur wont even be slam with custom you can get over that though what you wont be abl to get over is the tasteflavor of the sushi it arriv extrem fresh but it tast like cardboard ive tri almost all of them and the onli one that is worth order is the philli roll  what doe that tell you about the place the miso soup i love miso soup ive never had a bad serv of it until i came here and ask for them to take it back 

speak of miso soup  if you sit by the bar youll get a complimentari bowl of it and a plate of edamam 

so all in all  go to stingray definit depend on your sushi standard if you dont mind lacklust sushi and love cheap happi hour go here if your a sushi snob like myself then spare yourself and go anywher elsmy ladi and i decid to have a nice girl day out so we head to rachel kitchen for brunch 

i was a littl disappoint to find out this place was a stand up and order at the counter type joint im not embarrass to admit it i like waiter servic we order and found ourselv a tini littl booth to accommod us the tabl was abnorm slim and not veri practic 

heat kept waft from the kitchen area which i found a littl annoy i order the grill chees and a watermelon juic my friend order the breakfast burrito the food was pretti good not near good enough to be worth the somewhat hefti pricetag but i digress the food was fresh and my friend love the potato although i found them to be a tad soft and underseason i love my fresh watermelon juic and high recommend that so refresh whenev i see that on a menu i have to order it my favorit 

all in all ive had better but this place will do in a pinch im definit not itch to go back and if im in the area again id probabl tri ani number of other restaur option good option for healthi eat thoughmayb im miss someth  my mom who is visit and i went here for lunch today after she had found a few creperi onlin  we have had plenti of crepe from differ type of place and these were not what we want at all  

i order the matterhorn which was more like a taco salad sinc it was in a crispi bowlshap crepe  this is what i chose becaus it has proscuitto  but i was so gross out by it after a few bite  it came with the proscuitto laid out in slice on top of the salad  even the steaktyp knife they gave me would not cut through it  my mom was half finish with her lunch by the time i got so frustrat that i had to pull it apart with my finger  i love proscuitto on sandwich but i was incred skeev out by how slimi it was and i end up almost gag a few time  it tast just fine but the slimi of the meat and the fact that i couldnt chew through the fat after alreadi swallow the lettuc tomato and chees gross me out to the core  

mi mom order one of the crepe with mushroom swiss chees and ham  she is a huge fan of crepe and she thought her was a bit flavorless  we were also not impress with the notsofluffi crepe that were made out of buckwheat  ick  

i walk in with high hope becaus the actual interior look like a chalet and i felt like i was on a bit of a trip to franc  there were even tvs that appar show the kitchen so you can watch the chefbut they werent even turn on until right befor we left  

they do serv fondu as well and i might go back to tri it and give this place anoth trybut i am not get ani varieti of crepe again  we forgo the dessert becaus we were not happi with our meal and want to get dessert from elsewher  so ill have to mayb tri one of their dessert on my possibl return tripi came to le chalet for my birthday base on word of mouth and the review on yelp

i was disappoint my wife was disappoint and we wont be return unfortun  

the good
th salt caramel dessert crepe was superb   the flat iron angus steak my son order was delici the ratatouill stole the show in my opinion

th bad
 
appet  i order 2 order of garlic bread  what a complet joke  take a piec of sourdough bread from you local groceri store put some garlic and chees on a singl slice with tini bit of tomato relish and voila  at 5 a sliceripoff

entre  i order the la potenc the signatur dish  what a joke  this dish is be describ on the menu as be flambe tabl side by the chef and come with a skillet of wild rice  this was flat out false
it was attempt by our freak waitress who was nice and courteous who could not even get the portabl burner work  it was complet botch  the signatur dish the most expens dish on the menu and the god damn waitress flambe the thing  shame on you chef and owner  also wild rice  fals againi count and i mean i freak count about 20 grain of wild rice in a pan of white rice  shame on you again  my wife had the swiss chees fondu and i also ate some of itit was mediocr at best  the bread was stale and lack flavor  also the chees was flavorlesscom on guy serious  

for the record i ate all my meat it was a filet mignon thank god so in spite of the botch flambeau it was edibl   i skip lunch thoughnot sure if this play into it

when i walk in and saw 5 out of the 30 or so tabl occupi at 630pm i should of known someth was wrong  this is bell rd at prime time dinner rushouch
i doubt this place will be around much longer unless the chef and owner get serious again about the food  carraba next door was pack fyi should of gone there

not  you may disagre with my review i understand but let make this perfect clear  3 restaur share the same park lot as le chalet  the tuesday night i went with my famili the park lot was near capac  the restaur indian bistro right adjac was fill with peopl plus folk wait for seat  the chain restaur was fill up with peopl and folk wait outsid  le chalet had 8 peopl insid eatingmi famili made it 12 total    

when those trove of mediocr chain restaur have 500 more busi than your 5 star yelp restaur someth is serious wrongand it sure isnt the customwith the steadi suppli of accolad and award i realli realli realli want to like this place  the crust was too char for my tast and almost cracker thin which was overwhelm by the high qualiti top  i cant complain about the qualiti it was the execut or perhap i just dont have sophist enough tast  i felt that the top would have been better serv on a slightlier chewi dough with a more substanti crust  the restaur itself is cute well lit and bright but noth to write home about  servic is fast i think the wood burn oven cook a pizza in three minut flat but im not sure ill be make the drive again when there is cibo gasper bianco and even grimaldi around the cornergreasi is an understat  

i know they smash their angus beef on the griddl to seal in the flavor but ive had much better  had the sin citi burger with haystack onion fri egg and applewood bacon  nice concept present and yesveri fill  but the fresh and season of the larg patti was blindsid by the greasiness
smashfri were betterall i can say is my slider was raw not rare rawa you can see in the pictur i post  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosm5nizy68d2gttvwz89elfaselects2lfogdakxsygh9zjlvsew

also we wait 45 min for it grant the food was cook to order but if everyon is get slider and if there a long line whi not cook extra patties

it the first gourmet food truck in the area but honest i cant wait for the secondbefor you get mad slidin thru actual get a 25 i get it theyr nice guy they fist bump you to make you feel special even though your not they have a cool atmospher with what some consid to be good music i dont and they serv pretti tasti slider ive caught the truck twice befor in the past and both time my stomach was still hungri and the pocket in my pant felt molested

im not go to whack around the bush slidin thrus price are outrag if you are like me and thought that 3 slider for 7 was a bit much on the truck your go to be total disappoint now seven hundr and forti six dollar for a singl miniburg just kid but you can pay upward of 350 for one burger and as of open day no 3 for 7 how cheap and not the good kind of cheap either 

in the end i agre with the mass that slidin thru has a lot of charact and good eat but unfortun they also have steep price and long wait time did i mention my slider bun werent exact fresh either if im go to pay near four dollar for one tini hamburg it better give my mouth a boner 

while it good to see slidin thru open a locat so close to my hous i think ill take my three million carl jr coupon thank mailbox to uncl carl and get me some fullsiz charbroil burger in the futur call me cheap  i work hard for my money the menu is refresh and the fist bump are a nice touch but itll take more than that to get my yen

 this review is for the durango locatthis selfserv frozen yogurt shop is locat at mandalay place right where mandalay place meet mandalay bay  they had a decent though not great varieti of flavor and top fruit nut candi bar and ghirardelli syrup surpris they were miss cereal  the frozen yogurt like chocol and pumpkin was okaypretti good flavor and firm enough but not ici texture

th problem with this frozen yogurt shop is that it is quit expens 049 per ounc  while that high price should not be too much of a surpris consid that yogurt in is locat in vega this place qualiti and varieti alon would put it in the averag to below averag rang when compar to other frozen yogurt shops

they also sell crepe here  servic was quick and fine

mandalay place has a complimentari park structur  complimentari valet park is also availi like the concept of rambo kitchen old school 60s diner with retro ambianc and bright color i love thing that are loud and that stand out now the lack of execut with the food is whi i give this a 2 star rate 

the food doesnt stand out as much as the decor doe ive order mani item from their menu and all have not left me want more ive come to know of this place through my cowork our doctor like to order the fish and chip from here so we  do  order lunch here onc in a while 

last time i ate here i had order a philli chees steak but unfortun they decid to stop serv philli steak they let me know i can have a chicken chees steak instead ehhh i opt for it chicken was dri bread was on the hard side and fri wasnt crispi enough i do love their ranch though i can drink it like water lol

their menu is kind of clutter there is too much go on i dont know where to look first 

i honest would not eat here on my own pocket but if the doctor want rambo for lunch well i guess i have no choic ani other day you probabl wont see me hereholi let down batman 

i total got suck into the five guy hype read the owner stori about open the restaur with his kid  how he doesnt spend much on the restaur themselv but instead focus on the qualiti of the food  how they dont deliv that noth is frozen etc  but abov all how good their food is 

mr boss of all five guy franchis  pleas visit your restaur  

in and out   better than five guys

smashburg   better than five guys

delux    better than five guys

fat burger   better than five guys



mcdonald   better than five guys


perfect twice fri french fri  soggi mess

fresh ingredi  i cant disprov this but to cook said ingredi to death and then dress them up with as mani condiment as i want  no high five for you it like offer me fanci ketchup with my wellwel done filet mignon though to be fair most place cook everyth to well done it was just a mess here though
 
and the kiss  i paid 5 buck for said tasteless krabbi patti of woe  i went in to the restaur think  

wow me 5 guy fuck wow me   

that all i want  give me a reason to come back  i cant believ you formula for success is to bank on the mass have mediocr tast bud  cant say this isnt the right formula for success but comefuckingonyes i am onli give five guy 2 star can you believ it me the woman who rave about have a five guy in the area the woman who love love love five guy when i live in virgina this five guy doe not even begin to compar to how they do it in va 

i was so excit about get a burger and fri today i mean i was cheat by go for a burger and fri instead of work out walk into this five guy i was excit the staff were friend the place was spotless and they were get order out fast so i order my littl bacon cheeseburg with jalapeno mustard grill onion and mushroom and a order of regular fri about 7 min later i was out the door and head home the food smell heaven in the bag and i couldnt wait to get home to devour my meal 

i get home open the bag and grab a few fri yum we are off to a good start i dig to the bottom of my bag and grab my burger i slowli unwrap it take a bite and say wtf where is the meat i swear that burger lack flavor and meat i mean i rememb when even the littl burger was still to big yes i know that the littl bacon cheeseburg mean it onli come with one patti but doe it have to be the thinnest hamburg patti ever i mean mcdonald even has a bigger burger than this sandwich did i was so disappoint the best part of my sandwich was the bacon and the top sinc the actual burger was more like spread at least i had enough fri to feed myself and two friend and they were pretti good 

so two star one star for the fast friend servic and one star for all the fri i could eat and for the bacon on my burger otherwis you get a big fat fail i may give you a chanc to redeem yourself in a few month but the next time i go you had better bring it 

ps i end up go to work out anyway sinc i was so disappoint failthe food was veri good tasti and fill the bad servic is the major issu here that is what is unacceptable

w were walk down fremont head to dupar as we were in the mood for shrimp cocktail when we saw a sign at binion advertis their 495 burger in the cafe and it look good as it state fresh ground meat daili 

we are seat and the servic was prompt we place our order and got our drink and food and start grub howev not realli much of ani servic as our food was drop and our server never return other than with the check at the end what if i had want a refil which i alway do ugh

th hamburg was veri tasti and was dress your own burger style with lettuc onion tomato mayonnais ketchup mustard on the side  the burger come with a delici red potato salad which was a nice treat or you can have fri for 150 more

th low two star rate is for the bad servic we receiv while dine and from the cashier as we were head there to pay for meal 

there was a cashier stand toward the entranceexit area of the cafe that we were head to with bill in hand as we were walk toward it this african american ladi did not catch her name grab my boyfriend arm tight and pull him back say she is on break come up here and pay he was in shock i did not see it becaus i was still in the process of walk to the cashier at the front exit all i hear is my boyfriend holler at me to come here and i see him at the other cashier look puzzl we have never dine at a restaur and been manhandl this was nuts

a we are walk out my boyfriend grab his arm and tell me what just took place he was in serious shock from what just happen he work as a person in charg at a well known restaur and say he would never do what she did to a custom it was total out of line and inappropri to say the least that ladi had no damn sense

what she did was uncal for and not profession yeah like we are realli go to dine and dash on a 1200 tab if i was go to do that we would not have order a 495 special

it was an honest mistak by walk to the wrong cashier station how in the hell are we suppos to know she is on break

i have left a voic mail messag for doug the cafe supervisor i am wait on a call backgot a coupon for two breakfast buffet had the breakfast two day in a row egg were good other stuff ok but here the real kicker for meboth day tatertot were the onli potato option at breakfast classi  

mix in some shred or home fri and ill bust out anoth star on you goldennuggetlvwe walk in for dinner and the place is pack im think this might be a good pick then i realiz it first friday i curb my enthusiasm the three of us are quick seat we made reserv and then we waitedand wait then the busboy come over and ask if wed like water a minut later someon els ask if wed like water then our waitress final come to us and ask if wed like water im  sorri i didnt  say yes to all three but i thought id be nice  this is start not to look good we order our drink and my beer tast and felt like it had been sit on a back counter patient wait to be serv it less then cold we order our tapa and wait  20 min later my dish is serv and onli mine the second one serv 510 min later i had order the cordero chop australian grill lamb chop the honey aioli serv in a small plastic contain along with a bit of cole slaw that had no flavor was slight bitter with pickl shallot laid out as an after thought

 i understand tapa size serv portion but come on for 1200 id like to see my lamb chop one chop was a nice normal size but the other was half the size of my littl finger the aioli sauc tast like it should have been use for the cole slaw which did bring out the tast and the shallot wellmi daughter order the garlic camaron 1200 she said they were ok  which bring us to the paella velazquez 2800 which my daughter and boyfriend order a disast it was sent back  it didnt look anyth like the pictur on their web site one of the main ingredi lobster was no where to be found some of the other part to the meal appear to be miss or undetect i feel that if it on the menu descript you should be abl to see and tast the ingredi  

becaus my daughter is more diplomat and appropri then i am she spoke to the manag  the upsid to this veri disappoint meal was that the manag wrote off the paella plus gave us a 25 discount on the meal and if that wasnt  enough she took it over the top with four free drink card  becaus of the manag go over and beyond we will tri this small bistro again 

one last thing id like to add i dont understand whi so much confus and unfriendli of some of the wait staff  no  how are do tonight our waitress didnt give her name the girl who brought out our food just plop it on the tabl and left  i expect this at cantor our waitress was ok  i just think the servic need some look into as well as the chef keep a closer eye on what is be sent out under his name  by the  cook staff there shouldnt be such a long wait time for food to be serv and  the entir order should come out at the same time instead of piec meal it outive been here a coupl of time now eg birthday dinner bachelorett dinner and lunch

th food is general good  ive had the kobe beef slider which are fantast but 5slider  ive also had various other tapa plate includ fish street taco french fri a necess pita paella i think and of cours sangria

th last time i went was for lunch on my birthday  my boss and some cowork were nice enough to treatjoin me for lunch  i suggest the bar  bistro sinc none of them had been there befor or the current iter of it  

we call ahead to reserv a tabl for seven peopl and were seat in the room left to the entranc  we prompt order food and after that it sorta went downhil  

each of our individu food came out in 1015 minut interv  this meant that no one got their food at the same time and some peopl had to start eat way befor other in the group  there was no method to the mad  we had to ask the waiter a coupl of time to refil our drink includ hot water for tea that two peopl order  the hot water never came  

the worst was that one bosss food came out dead last liter 4555 minut after order  by that time all of us had finish our food  he had order tomato soup and a grill chees sandwich to add insult to injuri actual it was kinda funni after the fact the tomato soup came out in a tini i mean tini espresso cup  the sandwich were tini finger sandwich like the kind offer by old ladi at club meet  suffic it to say he was not a happi camper                 

i had a margherita flat bread type pizza which was actual pretti good  everyon els said their food was soso  the overal servic was terribl  im not sure if they were shortstaf that day or what the hizzl happen  to be fair they took the tomato soup and chees sandwich off the bill  but b  b  realli drop the ball  

ill like go back with famili or friendsbut for now im blacklist at work from suggest lunch place without the corrobor of someon els   that make me a bit of a sad pandai was hope to have a knockyoursocksoff experi here  i did not 

i love downtown vega and i am a fan of ani busi that is go to help the area grow  so kudo for that 

howev when you have alcapurria bacalaito mofongo and paella on the menu im go to judg you harsh if you cant deliv  

let me prefac by say that i knew go into this place that everyth on the menu was go to be the fancyp version of tradit spanish and caribbean food so there some leeway for artist interpret  i said leeway not screw tradit i do what i want  

ive had alcapurria bacalaito and mofongo on the beach of puerto rico so order this was a way to have a culinari nostalgia trip for me  nope no such luck  the alcapurria were bland the bacalaito were soggi and the mofongo was oili  for those of you not familiar with these food they are not suppos to be that way  

now the paella im think will redeem the menu  it a seafood paella with mussel shrimp clam bit of whitefish i believ cod but dont quot me and veggi and rice  tradit paella take at least a good half hour to bake and it should onli be made when it order  otherwis if it sit too long it can get gummi and chewi  so im think ok let the tapa settl and have some chitchat with my friend while the paella is readi  

sidebar  the chef was out in the dine room near the entir time i was there and he was have a loud convers with a patron about sourc market mixolog and all sort of other stuff which im sure would be interest if you were part of the convers but honest i dont want to listen to all that while im tri to have a pleasant dinner with a friend  get back into your kitchen and make sure your chef are on point with their food and your server are on point with their service

surpris the paella come out in about ten minut from the time of order  uhm what ok  so it look to have a fair amount of seafood in the rice and veggi and im think it look promis  i tast it  it salti  and not just salti becaus it seafood and there salt in seafood anyway  no i mean salti to the point that im drink water to wash out the salt  the actual consist of the paella was ok no mushi so good job there but i couldnt get past the salt to appreci the season  

i want to be a fan  i realli do  but im noti veri rare find myself downtown but i was see a matine at the smith center and me and my peopl need to eat so bar  bistro was what we chose there were 3 way to walk into the restaur there were no obvious sign to entranc and i pick all the wrong door final we found our way to the host desk and he sat us at our tabl  with no menus ive never been to a restaur where i had to ask for a menu he said that they didnt have enough to go around so he grab us small paper togo menus good enough i suppos our server greet us she was friend and attent and help me make my decis my eye are perpetu larger than my stomach so i usual need some assist the food took forev but was delici when it final arriv i had the cangrejo benedict mofongo  tasti my mom had the paella mixto crepe  delici and the highlight  my gmas flan french toast 

it was an okay visit so  whi the two star 

after the show i return with a friend for a glass of wine and mayb tapa we sat at the bar  the bartend that was there when we arriv was an asshol with no concept of good custom servic and was join short after we sat down by a pompous asshol who also had no concept of good custom servic 

we sat down in a most empti place again i had to ask for a menu again they were out the convers i had with the dude went someth like this  may i have a menu uh  were out let me see what i can find sever moment later he return with a foodwin menu and i ask do you have a cocktail menu no are there ani specialti cocktail no  we just took pictur last week oh are you redo it no how long have you been open about a year we took pictur last week are there ani cocktail that you person can make no  mayb in a coupl week  my bad for assum that there should be a cocktail menu but the hundr of specialti liquor and liqueur bottl fresh herb in the well and all the jigger muddler and other such accoutr that all mixologist carri around would lead me to believ that they had a specialti cocktail menu appar not they just took pictur last week full disclosur  i got a littl snappi with the guy becaus he was the opposit of help enter the next bartend  no hello no eye contact just a louder than a whisper convers with the other bartend about if the peopl at the bar are cool  i have high expect for the level of servic in vega ani dickhead can put on a smedium size vest and bow tie and make a cocktail a custom servic is a skill and these dude these  definit not up to par

a coupl ladi sit down next to us they ask for menus ask the same cocktail relat question same respons they ask to place a food order and were then inform that there was a 20 minut hold on order ani food so the food would be 20 minut  the amount of time it actual took to prepar the food after it was order not okay and not okay with them so they left 

anytim im downtown i get excit about it futur the smith center all the cleanup local own restaur pop up everywher cool bar cultur how would this place handl an actual crowd on both occas the restaurantbar was onli 25 full whi arent there enough menus whi the belat specialti cocktail menu whi the egotist bartend i dont see this place go the distanc unless some serious kink are work out and i hope that they do becaus that flan french toast was someth elsthe two star are for the sweet potato fri which are delicious

everyth els is horrend here the food isnt bad per se but it is noth special and is ridicul overpr 

the servicewow this place may have the worst custom servic i have ever seen the waiter are slow and dont check up on you when they do check up on you bewar i had a waiter take my plate with half my food still on it while i had turn to talk to my friend i turn back to an empti tabl and a stillempti stomach becaus quit liter half of my sandwich was taken away without anyon ask me if i was done this would be bad enough on it own but ive had sever friend tell me they have had the same exact thing happen to them here

add to that their complet lack of willing to work with you or make you happi the pastrami here is tradit serv on rye bread i dislik rye bread so i ask my server if i could get it on white bread the answer no it come on rye 

what the kitchen is incap of slap pastrami and mustard on a differ kind of bread i end up order the club sandwich which came on white bread

sav yourself the time and money and go somewher els it will probabl be cheaper and have better custom servicim not a fair judg of republ ramen 

i have had amaz ramen too mani time now and when i go to a shop special in ramen if it not pretti great then i cant help but hate it they have tonkotsu ramen on the menu too so that alon set expectations

i order the tonkotsu ramen and hate it broth was weak with no depth of flavor noodl had no chew as much as i hope to love it i was complet let down

to be fair i dont believ there is ani decent tonkotsu ramen in arizona 

i just dont see whi this shouldnt be a concept that can be execut adequ here for me with the ramen ive had and love it definit wasnt

again im not a fair judg of ramen im mean and nasti about it it like sushi or uni onc you elev your expect by have the stellar stuff the mediocr doesnt cut it anymor 

and where i can eat american style sushi when i adjust my expect happi for crunch roll and california roll cant do it for ramen

if your not passion about ramen though it fine to ignor me if you dont have amaz authent ramen to hold it up to it probabl finethere just someth in a restaur name that will lure me for a visit like al beef those word togeth conjur up fantast imag of hunki blue collar worker you know the one they work hard and play harder each one starv look to get his fill of al thick juici italian beef sandwiches

in 1938 al beef open as a food stand in chicago littl itali the idea for the italian beef sandwich came dure the depress when meat was scarc so in order to help stretch the meat to feed more peopl the roast beef was shave extrem thin then made into sandwiches

ov the year al flourish earn accolad such as best sandwich in america from esquir playboy and other they were even featur earlier this year on one of my favorit tv show man vs food in an episod titl da italian stance

in chicago there an art to eat an al italian beef sandwich in the italian stanc the diner knee are slight bent posterior slight up and out and elbow on the counter this techniqu help to avoid get al gravi on your shoe it not the tradit gravi you might think of put on mash potato but more like the pan drip from the roast beef they dunk the entir sandwich in bread and all

unfortun all of this amaz histori and media attent doesnt seem to matter to the new franchis locat in north scottsdal the concept here is fast casual order from the counter then get your number call a few minut later to pick up your food

th interior was spotless clean the staff relat friend and the concept easi what not to like unfortun the food

i start with the big al 745 the 8inch version of their italian beef sandwich i want to eat it like chicagoan do so i order the sandwich dip then cover with hot giardiniera a relish of pickl pepper and veget take my posit with my butt in the air and my elbow on the counter top i took the first bite first i was amaz just how juici the sandwich was then anoth surpris hit me  the meat was almost flavorless

i was so disappoint that after a few bite i decid to tri a chicago dog 310 but the hot dog was so small and shrivel i wasnt sure you could call it a hot dog more like a hot mess

ther were a few highlight includ the delici bleu chees fri 450 perfect cook french fri cover with bleu chees crumbl and dress anoth treat was the tamal boat 580 two chicagostyl tamal cover with chili cheddar chees and onions

when one of the employe decid that it was time for headbang ball play thrash metal over the restaur loudspeak i took it as my cue to leave

mayb this place should be renam al french fri tamal mosh pit rock on man rock onwhen it open a few year back i was so excit to have this place near my home  i went a coupl of time back then and havent been back until this past friday  i had a mom night out from the other parent group i belong to so i decid to just go and catch up with the ladi i have not seen in a while  our server was ok not veri attent or percept  i order a glass of prosecco and the spici shrimp appet  the shrimp was realli spici and not in a realli good way  more like just hot sauc spici good  thing i had the prosecco and a glass of water howev onc my water was gone the glass sat empti for the rest of the night  i am glad i dont have to come backsinc i love come to bachi so much the first time i came back a 2nd time a week later but they were close for a privat parti  three day later i made a return  unfortun the servic was extrem slow take 35 minut to get our food  on top of this the waitress did not come one time to check on us  when we ask about get our fri they inform us that it was up to us to ask them to bring it out befor our burger if we want the fri first even though they automat brought us our fri first on our last visit

w order the peke duck steam bun which were veri good but not as good as burger  we also order the slider to which they forgot to add the fri egg we had want  the waitress gave us a 10 discount for all these mistak and the slow of the servic but i left feel veri dissatisfied

i can understand the wait if the restaur was pack but almost 40 minut for food when the restaur is less than half full is incomprehens to me especi when the waitress doesnt even come to check on youdisappoint see grown men argu and the mistreat of employees

i was initi excit to watch the 3d episod talk about this spot and the same feel follow me as i was on my way to the spot too but after i park the car and was seat within 4 minut flat it all came to a screech halt  i visit the spot with 2 other in which they also saw what i saw and felt awkward for be our first visit and after view the same episod on tv togeth and ventur from los angeles

her is the stress out drama that we encountered
w arriv greet seat hand the menu offer choic all go smooth with a smile from our server our server was lisa she was veri nice veri inton with us and veri affect by the experi we and mani other were forc to watch while sit in front of the kitchenpodium area after place our order for the same dish that guy fieri featur on 3d we had our beer serv up and then boom the stress out drama  while sip on our beer we encount a tall caucasian cook yell at anoth gentlemen on the opposit side about do their job right but what struck us as weird was watch one of them be handl to a back room becaus it start to get loud and some cuss word we later found out that the peopl involv were the actual ownerspartn of the spot veri disappoint to experi for be our first time

aft the experi we all decid to leav but your waitress lisa talk us down and ask us to stay and apolog for the experi and in second brought over our order and although she seem bother about what had happen with them she still gave a wonder smile

i gave your locat a two star and these are the reason why
y you have a wonder the banhmi burger wonder truffl parmesan fri w sundri tomato aioli  drizzl porcini cream sauc and a knock out duroc pork belli steam bun with hoisin bbq sauc wouldv been better with a blue moon beer but you were out that day but all in all the food was phenomen hand down

i gave you the second star becaus of your server lisa she shine like a star 100 when you couldnt

not to the ownersmanagers
mi tini group and i agre that although you have problem no matter how big never bring them to the spot and especi never demonstr to your patron how negat ignor and disrespect you can be toward one anoth and your employe not to mention the children present you guy have wonder food dont taint it by your actions

i hate do review like this becaus i know you work hard to be top restaur in your genr  i attempt to speak with you face to face but that went unansw good luck in your futur venturthe peopl work here are nice and the insid is clean i had howi bread and that was hard and the pizza sauc that came with it tast terribl i like the thick of the crust on my pizza but the pizza itself realli lack flavor the pepperoni and sausag on my pizza did tast okay but the pizza all togeth just wasnt anyth special the amount of top on the pizza was fair there was suppos to be a garlic flavor on the pizza crust but i tast noth but a soso pizza crust im a big boy who can eat a lot and could onli eat 1 and a half piec im not a huge fan of littl caesar but the pizza there is cheaper on your wallet and actual has tast to itmy experi with soyo was disappoint  i order two item from the tapa section of the menuchicken gizzard with garlic and onion and son doo boo  the chicken gizzard were good chewi but that the natur of the meat  the son doo boo is suppos to be in beef broth  the water the two piec of tofu rest in shouldnt be refer to as broth  broth connot some type of meatfish flavor  this had none  it was mere a wateri dish with a side of dot dip sauce

it was the wrong day to go to soyo  the place is veri small  the tabl are such that it not a good place for a person eat alon  i was there a littl after 530 and there were onli a few peopl in the restaur  within a veri short time young peopl get dinner befor go to edc came in and i was take up a tabl that could seat four or even six  there was an error with my order and rather than have them bring the correct item order i hurri finish and paid the bill so someon els could have the table

ther are too mani good choic out there  soyo wont be a do over for mei got 3 strike at verd henceim out strike 1 not veri vegetarian friend strike 2 they have all the necessari item to make nacho but when ask if they would make me nacho i got a veri quick and blunt no strike 3 when forc to order a meat dish and request they not includ the meat the most expens ingredi not onli did they make no attempt to substitut the meat with mayb bean or guac or extra chees they still charg full price i dont want to eat meat and i sure dont want to pay for it 

and as far as the food well they got that part right for a place that serv fine fast food when you ask me how my meal was my respons would be finei drove 45 minut to get here the place was chinatown cute and the menu look bomb but the servic was skimpi they were nice enough but they seat you get your drinksfood to you and that it we arent high mainten so it wasnt a big deal for us but i can see this be an issu for other 

3 of us got soup with differ width noodl i order the same type of noodl as my husband but when receiv my noodl look at least twice the width as his the broth was ho hum just not enough of a savori type flavor and the noodl bland and tast doughi there were a coupl thing that were good like the potstick yum teriyaki chicken fri tofu but the general feel at the tabl was an ehhhhhhhh 

mi  famili polit chat about mayb tri other item next time but i felt like there was alot of disappoint around the tabl not to mention leftov that no one want to take home

yelpyou total let me down on this one i dont mind loud place but this was the most ridicul place ive ever been i was more abl to have a convers with my friend when i was at bonnaroo i am not exagger when i say that our waiter had to yell at us 

that said all the food we had was great my rib eye was cook perfect and super tender the mash potato were excel as well despit have to scream the servic was veri good too 

i wouldnt go back but if you dont mind realli excess loud environ while you eat youll get some veri good food price are ridicul but i guess that to be expect at a vega steakhous 

one small other thing full bar no they have no draft beer which seem to be realli common in vega i mean it a steakhous so im have a nice cabernet anyway but whi no draft beer if i want beer i have to have a 9 bottl of blue moon mayb it becaus im from portland and live in sf but i expect good restaur to have a few good draft some microbrew or a nice belgian or somethcant say as i was impress  they are go to have to improv the order system if they plan to surviv  i can get tabl servic an compar place for the same or lower price  we wait in line for 20 minut we were onli third in line just to give our order and onli then did they open up a second regist well after the line had snake out the door  even then the cashier for lack of a better term for her was robot and constant interrupt us midorder

onc order we wait a normal amount of time for how busi the place was  the chocol shake was bitter the fri arriv cold and my wife infus burger was less than spici  my classic was suppos to be medium the chef recommend but it was more raw than anyth else

i would tri it again but this place is on a short leash as not mani peopl will make a second trip out there unless the servic and qualiti take a huge step forward soon  if you like a drive and a burger your better off go to greasewood flatperson i am never go back to lush burger rather than tri to convinc you to follow my lead allow me to simpli recount my recent lunch experi and you can decid for yourself 

i was read the scottsdal airpark news the other day and notic a coupon for a 10 lunch combo special this special is also publish on lush burger profil page in the iphon yelp app  the special includ a classic lush burger a side of fri and a fountain drink 

i decid to sit at the bar the bartend ask if i want a menu and i told him that it wasnt necessari as i have alreadi decid to get the 10 lunch special he ask me what type of fri i would like and proceed to list them regular sweet potato or truffl fri i ask for the truffl fri the food was veri good the truffl fri not quit as good as zinc bistro but still fair tasti the burger was fantast cook perfect medium with a nice mild sauc and fresh crisp veget  

then the bill came 1344 as usual at restaur there were three slip in the bill so i look at the item version 

lunch combo special  1200 
tax  144 
total  1344 
 
now the moment of truth do i ask about this at risk of feel cheap or do i just pay it and leav consid the hamburg was so good on princip i ask the bartend about the 2 differ rather than apolog he began to explain that their comput sometim doe that and then he ask you had the truffl fri right i said yes that was one of the option you gave me after i told you i want the special he thought about it for a moment and explain how he was go to tri and work it out on the comput he came back drop off a singl nonitem slip for 1144 and hastili made his way all the way over to the other side of the bar and began slice lemon anoth moment of truth should i ask about it or just leav i decid to ask rather than walk over to me he just nod from across the way to see what i want what the 144 for i ask loud enough so he could hear me over there tax he curt repli at this point i decid just to pay and leav  

what realli bother me is now i am the one who is go to feel guilti all afternoon for get so work up over a measli two dollar and chang how silli of me to think that lunch on a beauti friday afternoon should be a pleasant experi 

in case you were wonder accord to the internet sale tax in az is around 7 and scottsdal add anoth 165 on top of that so i dont realli know where that other 6 tax came from on that extra 144 he probabl just subtract 2 from my origin bill or mayb restaur have some other tax oblig that i am miss but i smell someth fishi in this burger jointwow  go a 2nd time a few week after the open  talk about loss of credibl fo shizzl  the servic realli suck big time  wait approx 15 minut unti we could even wave someon down to order drinki would have to agre with a lot of the review about the servic realli sub standard our server was actual veri cocki realli close to annoy and rude

th food 

pierogi  ok had some caviar on it 

flatbread pizza with truffl oil  decent thin crust had a great crust

scallop  it was borderlin bad 

chicken wing thai curri  the best dish of the night  chicken wing lollipop style cover in curri thai sauc veri flavorful

tuna tartareok 

chocol ravioli  horribl 

toff cake with ice cream  recommend to us   i did not think it was that good 

we did have a great bottl of pinot  noir 

hookah ok 

close to three star but the servic was just not up to par 

i doubt if i would be backit deepli sadden me to have to write a review like this for a restaur that final offer a menu from which i have choic i am a vegan and selfprofess health nut and was veri much look forward to tri absolut everyth on this menu now that ive tri a good chunk of it my heart has drift from the illus that a swanki atmospher and a menu dot with gfs and vs will alway be indic of sheer healthi brillianc nay

mi first visit was the height of the romanc i was so excit by the idea of choic that i tri as much as i could on a mild empti stomach  the confetti veggi salsa of the day and mango avocado saladat the time my enthusiasm trick me into think it was all light and delici but as i walk away i had to be honest with myself there was hard anyth on that confetti veggi salad the salsa tast like it came from a jar with some pineappl chunk thrown in and they forgot to includ the nourish energi mix green in my spici mango avocado salad this girl like green what do i have to do to get a littl leaf around here

i was will to clear the slate for my second visit i want to tri more item and have a better experi this is a new joint and i am a new custom i want to be a patron nay to advertis that their bacon has no nitrat but then to use sulfur apricot in the quinoa salad  i dont know how to convey my confus the fruit salad look like it came from the bottom of a bowl that had been sit for 2 day  pink pineappl and brown kiwi what realli got to me was the wild rice  im from minnesota home of wild rice and this is not wild rice this is brown rice with a few wild grain stud throughout and it was so salti that it tast like it came from a rice a roni box im so sad that i wrote that but it true

il sign off on a more posit noteth sweet potato fri were delici and light i have not tri the sandwich or burger yet most becaus the portion look huge but i will probabl come back to tri one for the sake of have a complet experi i wish for a better represent of what healthi cuisin has to offer  i know the spirit of nourish is on the right track i just hope the deliv catch upmay 12 2012

this year i enjoy the locat of the san gennaro feast more than the previous year when it was host at the silverton hotel  casino 

we park at the gold coast hotel  casino had a few drink then walk over to the festiv we went around 8pm after the sun went down and it cool off a bit it was still boom i am glad we did not go to the rio for park we could see what a bleep nightmar that was with all of the car and park congest no thank 

we walk around to take a look at all of the food vendor option befor decid on what we would grub on that took awhil as it was wall to wall peopl just walk through to check out the food vendor was an obstacl they creat the isl too narrow and did not think of the crowd when set it up i dont enjoy buy an ice cold beer and have my freak elbow knock into spill my beverag no no no i dont enjoy in the heat of the desert night walk grind hip and rub back with stranger 

okso after the complet challeng of get your food where to sit and eat you say not enough tabl and chair we had to search as if on a scaveng hunt to find a spot to sit and eat our food that was grow cold by the second ugh

ok so on to what we atew had mani round of cold beer from the beer tap truck mmmmm so refresh and cold and i am not even much of a beer drinker i had three beer just becaus they were so cold and went well with our grub and the heat yeah it was still hot out at 10pm we were some sweati mofos

w stop by tast of chicago mmmm yum and so glad we did we order an italian beef sandwich paperthin slice beef marin in a jus serv on italian bread that was tender and tasti nice size with lot of meat we also order a pizza puff mmm yes yum you heard right a pizza puff a deep fri pizza pocket like pastri but delici and load with yummi sausag chees marinara spice that was a winner i could have eaten mani more of those mmmm yum yum yum yes yum i say ok so this vendor happen to be a local joint they are locat insid of lucki at 7345 s jone blvd lv 89139

cant forget dessert classic funnel cake sprinkl with powder sugar and cinnamon did the trick was fri perfect so tasti i was moan at this point in our ventur it satisfi my need my want my crave for someth sweet and delect to embrac my accept tongu mmm yes i need you and you gave me what i want thank you mr funnel cake

w happen to sit next to some realli cool local who we could shoot the shit with was awesom we had a blast talk laugh and joke it up exchang phone number yeah made anoth bff also yay 

the music was awesom enjoy listen to the live musician do there thing on stage make us groove

on 2 star the food is good but overpr yes we expect that unfortun the crowd control suck ball and not the kind i usual like to suckl on they just want our money it is clear they do not consid the comfort or conveni of us the patron we are just a heard of cattl they need to milk and send on our way the negat outweigh the posit on this event

they also have merchandis vendor and a few carniv type ride set up for the childreni usual like riva and have ate there frequent but today kill it for me i buy 4 entertain book a year becaus my famili and i love to eat out so be extrem hungri my sister and i went there today to order some food and went to use our internet coupon from riva that we had just print some rude ignor ladi tell me that it a fake coupon and she wont take it i tell her we have use them befor and there is a valid code on it and if she thought it was a fake call the number and valid it she basic call me a liar and refus to do it they have lost my busi for good juanita you need a better attitud and you could use a lesson in english as well my husband is hispan and i am no where near a racist but if your go to conduct busi you need to be abl to proper understand and listen to your customblah
not my scene at all
1 there is no where to sit unless you want to shell on a ton of money for tabl servic 
2 so so sooo crowd the pool start look a littl gross after a while you can see a layer of oil float on the water from all the greasi bodi awkward danc in the pools

it a realli pretti venu with a gorgeous bar area free mimosa for girl on the guest list but just not my scene id much rather relax on at my hotel pool with a fruiti drink and a comfi chair

id say it definit worth visit onc but i dont know if ill come back  im just glad my friend and i were abl to get in for free and score free mimosa too while we were in therei was unimpress from the curt girl who didnt want me to be there to the lemon cooki that was realli more of a dri crumbl minicak noth about this experi was great for me 

i realli dont have much more to say other than that and that i will take my sweet tooth elsewher mergood idea poor execution

b a 5 minut drive from the hous and get a coupon in the mail was enough for us to give this place a shot  i like the idea of a veri basic concept with few option to start and then you can make it your own after that  it just didnt deliver

her the breakdown

pros
 the bun  they are made there are realli light veri tasti and a good size  i dont like burger with too much bun
 three size of burger to choos from  someth for everyone
 ingredi seem to be pretti fresh
 the regular fri were pretti good
 you get to add your own fixins

soso
 the sweet potato fri were a littl char  enough to give them a bitter tast  they also are thicker cut with skin on which was okay by me but could have use a littl more saltseasoning
 the place seem clean overal but there were quit a few fli around
they seem to have a decent select of sweet but we didnt tri any

cons
 the fixin bar is weak  not a lot of fresh produc and they offer shred lettuc which i think is messi  it could use fresh avocado pineappl saute mushroom grill onion etc someth more than raw onion and two kind of pickl to dazzl up your burger with
w both order our burger medium and they were both definit well done
watermelon lemonad was a special drink made that day  i was excit but it end up just tast like water down watermelon  should have been more like lemonad with some watermelon than watermelon with some water and a littl lemon in it
it crazi quiet in there with no music and not mani patron it was like a library
ther were about 6 peopl work this small lil place which probabl could have been run by 23  team that with the quiet and you felt kind of on display for them all to watch and wait for more peopl to show up
weird hour  onli open until 7 and i think theyr onli open mf possibl msat  definit not sure on that part though

mediocr at best  if they work out the kink and revamp some of their stuff i might give em anoth shot  onli if i had a coupon again thoughstop in here this morn hungri for my usual mexican combo a chile relleno  a shred beef taco with spanish rice refri bean plus chip  salsa  here how it was for me


th good

  this is a clean modern littl cafe with booth     

  the combo i want wasnt offer on the menu but they substitut the usual chees enchilada with my shred beef taco for the same price 659  i also order chip  salsa sold separ 1  a cup of coffee

  the helpyourself coffe was free

  the order of chip  salsa was big

  the anaheim chile relleno was tasti  came with a dollop of sour cream to put on top

  the taco was ok


th not so good

  the coffe wasnt veri good

  the chile relleno was small

  the spanish rice  refri bean were bare warm

ok so while villa here certain wasnt aw i have some mexican restaur on my list with similar price for the same meal that earn 5 starsorri iruna i cant give you the  just open pass anymor  in an attempt to give iruna a redempt from our first visit my hotti and i met up with anoth coupl for happi hour  as it turn out  we were unabl to get hh price becaus we were sat at a tabl insid we request outsid seat but the host said i dont think we have anyth outsid if i knew that was go to be a 50 differ in my bill i would have made him check 

the good 
1 wine selection
2 red sangria

th bad 
1 pan con tomato oop they forgot the tomato garlic and salt so i basic got bread
2 spinach and goat chees stick burnt onc again i mean even arbi has master fri cheese
3  the price are ridicul for the small portion and qualiti 

i dont mind spend  over 100 on a meal for two peopl and hard get ani food if  1 everi bite is savori and delici or 2 if it a realli cool place iruna is neither of these in fact we left  went to rnr and got more foodoverpr overhyp and there is usual a hand of scantili clad women up in there walk around flaunt their cleavag with their short tight dress sometim alreadi drunk or plan on be buzz at least on realli bad night you will have realli drunk peep make a scene by do stupid thing and this is from my firsthand experi of make the visit here as the default tour guid for my friend and fam visit from out of town and this is just for the candi store portion of it 

as for the restaur part of it i have yet to make visit in there but base on my descript of the candi store itself whi would i usual ani place that is right on the strip is guarante to have it price mark up and the restaur is not ani differ 

never mind the fact that this place is conveni locat right underneath the chateau nightclub but you will also have hooligan come in from the strip itself

now for the candi store portion of it yes you will find all sort of candi from jelli belli mms sweet n sour combin to jawbreak and my wife favorit chocol cover gummi bear you also have a separ ice creamgelato bar as well sinc it is on the strip you will pay more than you would at anoth store somewher els away from the strip 

so i wouldnt make a special trip here unless you just happen to be on the strip or are stay at the pari hotel

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 6lot of selectionsit just that theyr mediocr one mostly

th place is nice enough though the contrast between the dark on hotel side is in stark contrast with the bright by the window on the street side i did find the littl corridor that hous the keg to be a fun view but too mani tvs in a singl eye viewspac them out would caus less vertigo 

the peopl at the bar are nice enough and some know their beer while other dont  the guy who most help us was a bit pushi but let up with some friend banter from there on out he was fine to deal with anoth one even knew who russian river breweri was frank i was shock 

i was a bit let down by the select there wasnt much of anyth on the regular menu that couldnt be bought for far less down the street at total wine their special season select did have a few albeit veri few interest select id say if you were into common beer and not veri adventur this place was just fine if howev you are a beer fan or advoc or hell even a beer nut then youll be realli realli disappoint by the selection

soso but toler so wont knock your sock off but you can at least get some regular brew on draft if you searchstop by when i found out it is in the same shop center somewhat next door to rais canes

th place is fair small but it look veri bubbl in person and the smell of cupcak is veri alluring

th cupcak are realli nice box and the cupcak itself are realli nice to look at they are well decor make me want to buy one of each  but the price per cupcak is quit expens at 350 per cupcak but the ice is way too much for my tast that it somewhat overkil the tast of the cake becaus i could bare tast the cake flavor the ice was realli sweet and the cake itself was not veri moist either come in around 130pm or so

th thing that bother me was where is the workerownercashi at and then i realiz there was a postit that wrote ring to call associ or someth like that on the counter it was the first time see that a custom had to ask for an associ right from enter the door custom servic wise it was disappoint when the ladi did come sinc i never been here i ask what she would recommend or what is most popular and she stare at me like what kind of question is that and went on to say what was sold earlier in the day i dont think that kind of question is out of norms

shal continu on my search for other cupcak place befor come back againallow me to break it down

arr at a boofay and pay at 837pm per receipt  
after take a seat and gather drink proceed to boofay tabl to commenc face stuf select

upon return politebutunfortunatepuppetforstinkycolognemanag asst manag present me with a busi card on the back of which toomuchcolognestinkymanagerguy has hand written a note entitl me to one 1 free adult boofay at ani time of day
ther were three of us in the parti and appar toomuchcolognestinkymanagerguy has decid that sinc im the onli one complain then i must be the onli one who deserv a free meal credit

poor custom servic has made me second guess my love of cheap ass boofay  i guess ill just stick with my nasti indi china boofay and avoid this walmart of culinari mass volum all togethso much potenti but ultim a let down  

we arriv at 730pm without a reserv to be fair we had a groupon and the fine print did requir a reserv but the place was empti except for two diner insid and a parti of three on the patio eric hesit but did accommod us on the patio we order two beer and the chees plate to start as we munch on the nice present chees plate and sip our beer the waiter came out to take our order he recommend the duck pizza we plan to order two pizza and a dessert he loud ad up our tab and announc that we were his cheapest groupon custom ever a few minut after order he reappear and veri unconvinc told us that they were out of all pizza and we would need to order entre this was a desper attempt an an up sell as chef eric was obvious annoy that he accommod us  

we were tempt to finish our beer and chees plate pay the check and leav but we did order two pasta dish they were mediocr at best 

this is probabl one of our least favorit dine venu downtown the person of the ownerchef is larg respons for our disappointi have mix feel the servic was not good the food tast great but i felt it was overpr there are no pic of this place onlin becaus it tini and a littl claustrophob insid 

i figur out that the chef and the waitress are a husband and wife team but they are not friend at all she rude said to the other waiter theyr gonna have to wait for a tabl then sinc they came late yes we were 15 minut late for our 1030 am reserv i didnt think wed be crucifi for it anyway we wait outsid on the patio in the burn sun for 40 minut wait to be sat 

then they were out of the first three thing we tri to order what we final got was tasti and the waitress final lighten up right so after a 60 brunch for 2 you could act like you appreci the patronag 

im intrigu by the menu but i dont like the atmospher enough and i would like to be treat pleasant when im pay for overpr food which happen to be my 3rd choic on the menu probabl wont be returni am not sure if it is the fact that this lee sandwich is locat in las vega that the owner feel compel to follow the lead of other wellknown and love californiabas eateri ie pink hotdog sam woo that set up shop here by jack up the price and cut back on what it serv  at least that is what i think after visit lee post their offici grand open  sandwich still tast the same except you just get less of everyth that goe in between the fresh bake baguett meat pickl radish and carrot and even cilantro and slice of chili  ice coffe still tast great except you get more ice than coffe  even if you ask for less ice you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full imagin an inch of noth to top of your plastic cup

anyway the place is new and veri nice look  staff is still tri to master the sandwich menu so i am sure eventu they will get faster with fulfil the order  but unless they start to serv what we can get normal at all the other lee sandiwch shop up and down california potenti custom are better off patron other local banh mi shop  and there are quit a few of them just a few block down spring mountain rd

i wish i can like this lee sandwich more but after a few visit i am too disappoint to want to go back  as it stand i feel that this lee is tri to set the bar extrem low for what custom should expect from this locat perhap not realiz that a vast major of the patron have had the lee experi from california prior to visit this one  i can onli guess that as a new food servic oper in las vega they fail to do ani sort of market or demograph analysi andor extrem ignor of the commonsens knowledg that rough 50 of the visitor that come to lv are visit from ca land of the lee sandwiches

so we will see how well they fare after the novelti wear out becaus without a cours correct i see onli iceberg ahead for this titan of a lee sandwich

upd  from david y a worker told him to ask for less ice and more coffe when order their lee ice coffe otherwis the futur lawyer fulfil the order behind the counter will do exact as the custom request how knew order a ef cup of the common vietnames ice coffe is the step stone to studi for the lsatwhat can i say about monta i use to like it unfortun use to is the key word today i keep come back expect their classic ramen best broth and perfect simplic but i now must admit all i have come to expect is disappoint i have been come here for about 23 year but now i cant help but second guess my decis 

the servic here has seem to have gone down the drain they give so much attitud and dont realli care about the custom you are rush to order and if you have ani problem or question you are met with eye roll and sigh im not a picki eater not at all but servic is key 

now to the food i rememb the food they use to have was great unfortun that didnt seem to translat over time like watch the slow death of a onc great king the food qualiti has seem to die too  over salti broth oili broth boil gyoza and an appal meat to rice ratio on their side dish what happen what happen 

to this im sorri monta you have lost me i use to defend you feverish against other ramen place but now you have betray me so to all you newbi that rave and prais this new monta you can have it i will leav this place in the pastrex need to put a disclaim on this reviewi am fresh out of forc temporari housingwhich explain whi rex hasnt written in a while  the circumst are realli quit simpl rex believ that what a man doe in someon els dumpster is his own busi  pictur thisrex goe to his favorit singl wide dumpster to the uninform and findsand you wont believ thistrash in it philistin so rex remov it he sit down with a can of happi juic ammonia gasolin lead two moth ball three mento a tic tac and 6 toe nail clip that have been buri in the desert for 2 week and a 3 year old copi of giant white buttslik most men do on a thursdaytuesdaysom night whatev well sudden after half a bottl of happi juic rex saw 3 blue men they yell they grab at rex nextwhat happensi not total clearbut alledgedlya nake rex a beauti sighthold a top hat and stapler jump out past the blue men and ran down the street straight into a wall the wall stop rex run rex awok to a singl pad room against his will 

the first thing rex need outsid of lock up is food  after a ride from 4 kid out on a joy ride rex found himself in front of smashburg  this was not the first time rex has saunteredsashayedglid into smashburg rex will tell you the first time he went the second time and the third time he was underwhelm  decent food expens food not rex idea of a value

today was rex fourth time was it differ did he like it was he allow to leav after scream this is the kind of place that the nazi would have open if they won the war  the answer to all of these isno not at all

wher to beginwherev to begin  the first thing rex tri was the namesak of his town the sin citi burger a good burger and honest the best burger on their menuwhen done right they put a fri egg on top and if the fri egg is cook too hard and the yolk doesnt come outth burger isnt the same two burger two differ cook egg the yolk make a bit of  a sauc and much need sauc  the spici baja is just not spici sorri rex understand the underdevelop palat and my favorit ho third eye salli has half a tongu and isnt medic allow to eat spici food becaus of medic conditionsdidnt find it spici the mushroom swiss burger has mayo on it when a better sauc would realli make the burger  chicken sandwich you ask  they have them they are hit and miss the buffalo missbecaus the sauc isnt good the bbq ranch missbecaus bbq isnt good the avocado club hit 

what about the fri the hallmark of ani good burger jointwellhit and miss again just like when rex is ask to hit her bellybut rex miss on purpos  two time rex went he got the regular fri two time the smashfri the smashfri the first time were great the second time the rosemari and garlic seem like it was burn it has a bitter tast the regular fri were just that regular  third eye let me have some of her chili chees fri and they are pretti good the best of the bunch

th bottom line is that this not a great burger place becaus the qualiti control isnt good this is the type of food that need to be done right sad it isnt somehow in the 200 time rex has eaten at in and out he has never had a bad meal one 1 out of 4 time did rex have a good meal at smashburg oh and if you complainno one care just like when you complain to rex onli differ is you complain to a person at smashburgeryou complain to the memori of rex rex never see your tearson your sister nakewell that was disappoint i didnt see anyth here that would make me want to pay 39c per ounc when other nearbi popular place onli charg 30c less flavor less top the flyer say over 50 but there are onli 27 bin and the store is just ugli and a confus layout the qualiti wasnt as good either  the red velvet tast like cough syrup no thank ill stick to yogurtland

edit

i got a nice messag from branden p owner in my inbox

your a fukin fg come back to vega you hm and ill kick your fuke as for write your bullsht review i got a hacker friend go to find out your ip address wait til i come to your fuke door  and review you lol

in respons to his public comment my review was written 8 month ago when the price was 39c and accord to other review it has sinc been lower to be more competit which is a good thing it easi to accus someon of be a shill but i definit dont see ani indic of that in my other review  particular as this is the onli yogurt busi ive review i just happen to prefer yogurtland for selfserv in vega and for the record im a financi analyst in the consum financ industri  noth at all relat to the restaur industrilong overdue

thi place is mediocr if anyth id come here more for the game and candi than the actual yogurt 

when i went it was veri empti just me my boyfriend a mom and her son or daughter the mom and son seem to be the famili of the cashier that was work there becaus she kept go and sit at there tabl we went becaus they had a promo for free video game play go on we thought itd be poppin but we were wrong 

the place is veri white and veri retro look it pretti cool as long as they keep it sparkl clean at all time 

ive definit had better froyo their select just seem so ordinari especi all of the name probabl becaus i use to work in a frozen yogurt joint and i have seen so mani carton and select of yogurt 

i normal go direct to the tart flavorst so i got some mr t tart along with other flavor like peanut butter and red velvet they realli didnt have mani tart flavor but they did have a lot of the fatti sound one like butterscotch cake batter red velvet and chocol cake i didnt get ani top just becaus i never do 

i recal the yogurt be a few cent more than averag but they justifi their price by say it becaus you get such great qualiti no runni ici or flavorless yogurt i found it a littl weird that they felt they need to explain the price

w got some free game token and play some game they had a wide varieti of game to choos from but all i rememb is pacman it was fun and pretti entertain so entertain that i forgot about my yogurt so i took a moment to scarf it down 

the mr t was not tart at all it just tast veri plain and noth stood out about it the other flavor were alright noth id come back for though 

what i would come back for is definit the game we play a bunch of video game and finish off with a few long round of simon which was pretti awesom i love the game simon now i went home and tri to find it onlin but that shizz is soo expensive

pros
games
cool decor
nic chillax ambiance
friend staff
lot of candy

cons
location
 bland yogurt flavor and some were actual runni when they came out of the machine
bor flavorsthey should experi with better name to suit their theme and jazz up their flavor a bit


stat thing like you will never be a busi owner im sick of you wanna be worthless food critic  you obvious were pick on in highschool via messag from the owner is veri unprofessional
appar the owner yelp account has been hack for almost a year now wtf theyr either lie or dont have their sht togethi dont realli understand the great rate for this place im hope i caught them on a bad night

il be brief

th pizza was noth special and the servic was god aw  

the peopl watch was great if watch a coupl dri hump is your thing  most of the bar patron were deeeeeeee runk  note that i had been drink and was pretti far from sober myself

il be back in the area to eat next door at desnudo taco but doubt ill eat here again  that is allfood truck are total trendi these day so i figur i should tri one out im alway on the lookout for good latenight food to soak up the booz so i went over to chinatown one night to tri a fukuburg and see what all the kid are rave about

bas it just greasi burger and friesalbeit with a few unusu ingredi and kind of expens innout is a way better valu and the ingredi are just as fresh and wholesom but innout close at 1amso i guess if your hungri after that you might tri this truck

th one thing fuku has go for it is the ambianc  when i went it was park in a huge park lot in chinatown surround by tailgat kid smoke hookah and hang out it was like a littl outdoor fukufestiv which was neat

but on the merit of food alonemehi think my luck with fukuburg is all negat or neutral at best  way back on juli 1 pregrand open when i was follow them on their blog and went to a chinatown locat at 8pm where they said they will show up but end up be a no show after 6090 minut  then i wait in a line at one of the food truck ralli think it was for fukuburg but the long line snake it way to slidin thru and i end up miss that opportunity

anyway final thought my luck has turn when i was the second order place at the elli island sponsor food truck smashup event  when i receiv my burger 3 butaburg  5 karai i was pretti excit  final a short line and short wait for this elus and much love burger i thought  quick navig my way to a tabl in the shade i took two pictur and attack the burger  when i pick it up i notic that it was pretti greasi to the point that almost 13 of the bun was soggi from the puddl of fuku patti greas  as burger goe i was think this was no better than the cheap and greasi burger serv at holeinthewal bowl alley and all the peopl that love and rave about fukuburg must be on crack

at this point it would be a 1 star review  but then i see the burger that other order and i did not see the greas soak bun or the puddl of melt fat in the paper tray and realiz that the food truck god have diss me again

know that they can make and serv better burger i will give them one more tri but if the consist is again on the negat side then that will be that  a down grade to 1 star for serv subpar food and lack of proper qa

1 star for the food  1 more star becaus i know they can serv better one than the one i receiv for pop my fukuburg cherriit never a good sign when you drive up to a busi and the park lot is empti to be fair it was 530 pm on super bowl sunday but still this is an indianpakistani restaur so youd think the typic crowd might be more world cup and less big game

it an even wors sign when you see vinyl letter on the window of an indian restaur that read salon de fiesta and sure enough walk into saffron for the first time it doesnt feel at all like a cozi indian restaur it feel like a banquet room onli two booth the rest of the expans room fill with roundtop banquet tabl chair cover in plastic a littl stage in the corner and complet empty

an indian restaur should smell like i dunno indian food when you walk in this place didnt it smell like  an old folk home or someth someth not right and it was dead quiet in there not even a tv or radio on

ther was one person visibl work in the entir place a middleag woman who was help enough but not veri friend you think shed be thrill to see even one person let alon a coupl walk in not so she kind of just gestur toward whatev tabl we want drop off menus and disappear didnt ask us for drink or anything

th menu was typic indian fare and price were about averag we order some of our favorit  veggi samosa pakora chicken tikka masala aloo gobi as well as some rice and two kind of naan at the same time the hostserverwhatev final took our drink order sad this joint doesnt serv alcohol i hate it when i cant order a good indian beer with my meal

it took a long time to get even our drink water and ice tea out which came with the appet the samosa were ok the pakora was weird im use to pakora be similar to tempeh  just veget dip in batter and fri these were more like spongi batter ball with dice veggi insid mayb theyr more authent i dont know but they sucked

th entre were solid noth to write home or um on yelp about kind of weakflavor but decent the naan was good enough 

we had a restaurantcom gift certif to use and when the ladi first look at it she said that not us she said this becaus their logo didnt print and she thought the miss imag graphic was someon els logo i had to point out to her the name and address and phone of her own busi she did eventu take the discount off our bill

interest at some point a man and his child walk in dure our meal heartili greet us and i assum he is the owner or manag at least which lead me to believ our hostserv might have been his wife mayb she was grumpi that she had to work by herself while he was watch the big game or someth had he been there when we first arriv we might have felt better but either way were never go back here which is a shame becaus it is liter walk distanc from our housthere anoth review here which describ saffron interior as be more like a banquet hall than an indian restaur and i have to concur complet when we arriv at around 8pm on a saturday the larg rectangular build was empti with the except of two other pair of custom at the round tabl in the main part of the room down one side there are four halfbooth although onli two of these appear to be avail for custom with one have a comput set up upon it and the other outfit with a pair of mismatch pad offic chair appear to be use as a hangout for the proprietor children when they arent help out with the restaurant

aft be instruct by a small child to just sit anywher we took one of the open booth and anoth child brought us our menus the cover look slight grubbi like they could have use a wipe down and i notic a larg stain on the side of the booth next door to our  it look like someon had spill a larg glass of coke over the side of the tabl at one point and that it had been allow to set befor wash chair and tabl were cover with plastic to ward off such spillag and the plastic on top of our tabl felt like it could have been a littl cleaner also as could the salt and pepper shaker which felt a littl grimi when we move them

th restaur is a bit odd and has a littl rais section in the corner opposit the door and the 1970s disco ball in the middl of the room the disco ball was just a mysteri and i expect to see the four children from the chronicl of narnia file in and take their place in the four thronelik armchair upon the curious dai at ani moment it was an unusu atmosphere

aft a few minut our host arriv with a jug of room temperatur water with shrink wrap cover the top he had collect this from one of the central tabl which was home to a collect of such jug he seem veri friend howev and quick accept our restaurantcom certif and enthusiast took our order in order to meet the 35 requir we order chicken tikka masala malai kofta shahi paneer and a select of naan two garlic one sesame

our host then present us with some pappadum and the usual chutney of tamarind and mint the mint chutney had a nice kick to it and although the tamarind had an uncharacterist odd ketchupi tast it mellow into a pleasant aftertast so it all work out we were cheer inform that we could ask for more pappadum if we like and as the host depart i comment to my wife about how the friendli and enthusiasm was enough to make me overlook some of the odditi of the place in my upcom yelp review

despit the fact that there were veri few other in the restaur we didnt see ani staff again for the forti or so minut it took for our food to arriv i wasnt bother at all by the longer than averag wait time and the food more than made up for it anyway my chicken tikka masala was a littl milder than i am use to howev the veri nutti and savouri shahi paneer was a perfect accompani i found my garlic naan to be tasti without be amaz but my wife found her sesam naan to be a littl overcook on the bottom the malai kofta was somewhat differ to other incarn of this dish that ive experienc the sauc tast more like a onionbutt sauc than creami but was tasti howev the kofta themselv were dark somewhat sharp in flavour and fell to piec at the merest touch of an eat utensil overal though the food was excel and we couldnt wait to return and i expect to award the restaur four star with a disclaim about the slight odd vibe to the place and mayb a friend suggest that they wipe up a bit in my review

thi is where thing took a turn for the wors a medium size parti had enter the restaur and place their order just as i was enjoy the last bite of saucedip naan and they also appear to have a coupl of takeout custom our host ask me how everyth was to our enthusiast respons and disappear into the kitchen

i got my credit card out and polit sat at the tabl wait to deal with my bill twenti minut later we were still wait ten minut later i ask a child if they could ask someon to help us with our bill twenti minut pass and a sur woman came out but it was to deal with a takeout custom the child still clutch our bill and restaurantcom certif final after about an hour of wait we were final dealt with and could get out of there lament that we could have driven across town to our home twice in the time we wait to pay for our meal

th food here is great but be made to wait a full hour no exagger to pay includ 30 minut after you tell them you want to pay is just unaccept especi when there were at least three adult staff member and custom was slowthis was a stop on a taco trek uye and i was glad becaus i alway see it but never go becaus taco el gordo is next door this place is pricey i was shock at the price for be a fast food place with a drivethru the taco are 3 each and that is befor top if you want chees avocado and sour cream it will cost you 5 per taco the taco tast somewhat ok but some of my asada meat was cook crispi and it seem the taco were fill with more salsa and junk then meat it was a hot damn mess to eat i just dont like get rip off when the taco doesnt even tast authent and the taco are overpr if you see the pictur of my 2 taco you will think it look good but are you will to pay 10 plus tax for them after buy a drink my total was almost 14 like i said it didnt tast bad but it wasnt anyth close to taco el gordo which is in the same park lot and right next door just go to el gordo trust meive been hope that this would be my goto place for a sonoran style hot dog in the phoenix area sad it wont be  tucson still own phoenix in that categori   the actual bacon wrap dog was just there  the bun bread was respect sinc they didnt use a hot dog bun but a tad stale  the top were weak  chop raw white onion  where are the butter laden grill one  also the pico tast mass produc store bought garbag   big let down   

i also got a burger and realli expect it to be great judg by the wall of mesquit smoke that hit you when you enter bueno burger  veri averag burger at best  it nice that you can custom your burger ala five guy for free but i couldnt tast the mesquit in the meat   

this place has a lot of potenti but it lack on the most import factor be flavor  until then it a roadi to el guero canelo for my hot dog estilo sonora fixthe food is still decent but this place is go downhil fast today is my 5th visit in the 6 month sinc they open and the place is in disrepair liter 

there is scaffold in the middl of the dine area hold up a broken roof truss they had most tabl full but the rest had discard foodservic item pile on them and there were fri and soda all over the floor by the tabl  the soda counter was filthi and a sticki mess and i truli felt bad for the elder coupl i saw clean their own tabl off when they realiz none of the staff would 

i realli want this place and other small local restaur to surviv but i dont think ill risk be crush by fall roof beam for the food again

upd got a messag from vanessa who say she is one of the owner she express concern about the cleanli and comment that the scaffold was temporari while the sort thing out with a contractor what upset me and made me add this updat is the comment she made to me about not appreci my review which was written from my actual experi 

sorri busi owner if you cant take candor from your patron on a public forum your in the wrong busi a negat review hurt your busi less than allow the negat experi that spurn the review in the first place

also the part about be crush by a fall roof beam was intend as humor not an actual express of fear of injuri i know nobodi would be dumb enough in our litigi societi to allow peopl in an unsaf facilthis is a good size sport baral hous  it is locat near the southern end of the shop center

w were sat right away and the staff seem friend  our server howev was clear overwhelm  we had to request drink multipl time in a few instanc to get what we order  there was onli one beer menu avail  not a deal breaker but quit inconvenient

i ate some off of two appet for my meal  the quesadilla was ok  not bad but noth special either  it is a decent portion as an appet  it would best best for split between two or three peopl   i also tri the ale hous load fri  they were ok  the portion is larg but i thought they were a littl blandhuh 
huh huh huh 
all in all a fine experi but will i go back eh if peopl want to go there sure but i feel like i did it and it done and i should have gone to nostrano
our waitress was nice she had some good thing to say about the menu and about her person prefer she also let us swap out some pancetta with scallop in a risotto starter so that was cool it was good lack depth though in my opinion and the scallop themselv were a littl over cook yet didnt have much of a crusti outsid from the sear im go to say the pan wasnt hot enough and they were in there too long cesar salad was probabl the highlight salad yup roast red pepper should come on everyth and this salad prove that the dress was mild yet tangi and dress the romain enough that each leaf was coat but not over so that it becam soggi and theeeeeeeeeeen my entre whole wheat pasta with veget and sausag in an herb broth first of all i have no idea what herb broth mean is that like chicken stock with thyme second of all there was no broth and thus there was no flavor third the amount of pasta was overwhelm they dont make it there becaus nobodi would send out im not joke near a box of penn in a bowl it was nut i ate around most of it but found the veggi to be way overcook and the sausag while made in hous lack the flavor profil that im use to from nostrano and underground meat 
mi biggest pet peev though is be told im suppos to leav without be ask at about 900pm or so a bus boy came by sweep the dine room into a dirti littl pile of the even food scrap bread crumb and dust then he start to rearrang furnitur then the music fade look you guy tell me it time to go and ill go but we made a reserv for 900pm we got there at 830pm which you were excit about and you told us you close at 1000pm 
a few month ago i stop at a culver just as they were close ask if i could grab a burger and they said as long as our door are still open were here for the custom 
culverthey put in a fanci soda dispens and in order to compens for the new expens along with rise food cost have drop the drink from be includ in their meal i onli got the gold peak tea to begin with so the machin doesnt do anyth for me they also rais the price of the meal to add insult to injuri i remov one star for remov drink from the meal and one star for rais the price while simultan give less 

probabl wont be a regular here ani longer the day of bfg are over just doesnt seem worth it to support this place anymor the kid at the counter is still realli great with custom servic though hes alway friend and attent just dont like the direct this compani is head in there are plenti of other place to get my chicken fix1 the wait staff all wear silli costumes

2 our entre came out befor the appet which was total bizarr 

3 the app were drop off at the tabl befor we finish the entre 

4 the food was ok but not worth what we paid 

5 they compd the second round of sangria due to the kitchen mixup so that was nice 

6 great locat right on the waterfront 

7 cheesi decor  felt like a chainoy vey this peter piper has been the worst i have been to we had to wait 15 minut stand in the front wait for someon to take our order and there was no one in front of us i am not sure if they were understaf or just didnt know what was go on a gentleman final came up front and took our order as if we just got there after order our pizza i went and play game with my son and half of the game were broken after 30 minut of play the game we could get to work i went and ask about our order becaus there were onli about 4 famili in the whole place and it was take quit some time to get our pizza when i ask the guy about our order he said it would be right up 15 minut later our pizza was final readi when i pick it up they forgot we order wing with our pizza so we had to wait for our wing to be made the pizza was realli dri and burnt tast the crust tast like cardboard and the wing were tasteless there was no buffalo sauc tast to them at all

dont think ill be make a trip here againhave you ever been excit becaus you want someth to be greatand then itsveri disappoint  this is how the stori went at vatra  it almost like the owner is a home cook tri to go pro  we went for lunch and all sign start wellw were greet upon enter the place it was clean and nice design and decor  the menu had mani item that were appeal  the waitress took our order and the ice tea was well brew and fresh some absolut fresh bake bread with some design butter came out and we were think thing were go welluntil the steak chimichurri arriv  what cut of meat it was i have no idea but it was under season undercook and super chewi  the chimichurri sauc lack ani flavor and this plate had some bore flavorless potato wedg  paellai have no idea whi they think this is anyth like paellait was 6 piec of overcook seafood on a bed of dri yellow rice  how the chef could tast this and think wow this is great is beyond me   the desert were bore and we were afraid to order them and have more mediocr fare  i fear that there is no hope for vatra and it is go to go down in flamei came here for a yelp event at the begin of the year and was surpris that the place had chang name when i was hear last month the atmospher was date and uninterest the main restaur are was so crowd too not with peopl but with tabl i almost felt claustrophob 

i was so disappoint in the food here mike and i split a 3 meat combo platter with smoke sausag beef brisket and slowsmok pull pork everyth just tast so bland and dri their bbq sauc were also bore the mac and chees i order also came with corn eew it was not good our waitress was forget and realli so was the whole experi herehorribl servic  we had a parti of 9 and brook was our waitress  we had to ask her to take our order after wait 15 minut and it took our food anoth 30 minut  we came around 100pm and it was not busi  the tabl next to us was seat after us and got their food befor us  brook spill water on me and did not apolog  food was also drop on me when they were clear the tabl onc again without an apolog  brook never came to check on us after we order our food and we had to ask for our bill  

good food horribl servic if you get brook i recommend you ask for someon els or find somewher els to eatunsatisfied

first off im realli sick and tire of go to this place and them not have half the stuff we want  cinnamon donut  no we dont have ani  we have cinnamon crumb  ham croissant  sorri were out  small boba drink  no  we onli have medium  uh  

a stinki tude from someon behind the counter can realli ruin a place for me  last night the ladi at bosa gave us a perfect exampl of a stinki tude  did my diet coke realli take five minut to pour  did you realli need two remind to give it to me  wtf was your problem lady

th donut here are good but im now tri to decid if it is all worth the frustrat  stay tuneif you like greas check it out they serv greas in all form at this fine establish  glisten on the surfac of shred and slab of quiver meat whip into a slime and drizzl atop grilledfleshcov french fri plaster on wall and window and employe facesyou can even get your greas as a sort of lacquer coat on grill onion and jalapeno they serv all four greas food group here

if your an unhealth greaselap fatass youll dig it but if your a fitnessobsess health nut who happen to be drunk and stumbl down the street at 3am youll like it too shame enough

th best thing here is the peopl watch it alway pack with an amaz assort of mexican famili coupl kid chunti and cholo even at 3am there are familia with littl kid sit around eat and laugh and bullshit 

sinc i find the food so abhorr i prefer to do my watch from the street look through the giant plateglass window at the hord of obes peopl shove greasi strip of meat into their greasi piehol it like watch the mexican version of caligula without all the penthous pets

on the plus side the staff is veri friend even to drunken guera like me but even that wont realli get me to come back hereunless i happen to be stumbl drunk and starv in the immedi vicin and i live right down the block

dohas a cupcak geek i was pretti excit when i saw the begin construct for this place earlier this year so i take no joy in express my disappoint with cupcak by design 

the first time i went in there i was realli surpris by what i saw for 350 per cupcak i expect a littl bit of creativ in the decor or someth instead i found cupcak that were about the size of what i bake at home with what amount to a dollop of frost yes they obvious use a pipe tip but there was no sens of fun or creativ in the decor and for 350 there should be a lot more frost i had their banana cupcak which was ok it was the first time i had a banana cake that wasnt like banana bread but rather cake with some banana flavoringthough i believ they use fresh banana the frost wasmeh whenev i go to anoth citi i alway stop at a bakeri and it rare that ive seen ani place charg 350 for the size that this place offer i just cant justifi it in this case

i was also a littl sour when i stop in their anoth time to talk to the owner about an event i was have i wasnt even ask for ani donationson if they happen to have dayold cupcak they want to get rid of if not no big deal i was go to go on and explain about this communiti event i was put on call cupcakecamp and mayb ask someon to come judg and i even had a littl flyer but the owner total shut me down befor i could go further she wasnt rude by ani mean but she certain put the curt in courteous i understand have trepid with a new busi and it fine to say no to me but to not even hear me out first frank kind of suck and if your a new busi youd think one would want to hear about an opportun to freeli promot to a big crowd i probabl wont be swing by here again until i feel like all bad cupcak karma has been vanquisha new player in the downtown phoenix food scene bliss is a creation by the folk behind the fez switch and ticoz empir they occupi a bulid onc occupi by fate and nine05 the former of which was one of my favorit restaurants

ent the restaur we were greet with an odor of mildew and dirti water which isnt exact a pleasant way to arriv into an establish be the onli one seat in the small space we were abl to realli examin it and i notic one glare differ between the way they have it set up and the way it was set up it feel like a cafeteria the instal of floresc light heat lamp and massiv amount of stainless steel in the open kitchen make this place feel like a lunchroom at high school whatev we can deal with it an overview of the menu show sever option which seem like drunk food fri everyth chees crisp foot long hot dog slider burger taco grill chees etc appar comfort food mean deap fri greas no thank i order the brais beef taco which had the consist of past but were averag in tast 

mi biggest gripe with this place is the microwav not even a turbo chef sit front and center in the kitchen look i understand that some restaur use microwav usual not good one in their kitchen especi if it a cold kitchen which this isnt but have it in plain view and audibl in the dine room is just atroci i truli hope someon from the restaur read this and hide the thing it made me complet lose my appetit when i saw them heat my girlfriend rice for her chicken skewer in the microwav yuck she did mention she was neutral about her food we are peopl who go out at least onc a day for a meal and tri a new place everi time so we know food 

everyon we encount was nice and the servic was veri friend everyon seem interest in how well we enjoy our meal the space and they seem interest in welcom us back unfortun the place look kind of makeshift on the rebar side and like a cafeteria on the bliss side im not realli sure whi it look makeshift perhap it is just becaus it look like a temporari wall in the back of the room or becaus it look so bare but it look like they are in there just for the time be 

i feel compel to go here again but onli for drink out on the patio the insid look like mexico the food wasnt veri good and the cafeteriamicrowav issu pretti much sum up this is not a place for a nice night out dining

i also find it interest how mani review are by orang head or peopl who were here for the vip open cmon tri the place befor you write a public review of it and by tri i mean eat some food and actual experi iti use a groupon for lunch at this place which was a smoke deal and i realli want to like it i realli did but unfortun the food was just not good i order the buffalo chicken wrap the tortilla was veri dri which made the whole thing fall apart i had to cut it up and eat it with a fork and if it wasnt for a few drop of buffalo sauc that i saw but couldnt tast i probabl would have sent it back think it wasnt what i order it didnt tast like it had ani sauc whatsoev in it i wouldv guess it was a grill chicken wrap with no sauc and the littl salad that came on the side was more like some leav of lettuc with a drop of oil on them there was no flavor at all

thi place doe deserv some credit for the atmospher the place is super cute and the servic was good all of the staff was veri friend and i realli like the feel of the place which made it even more upset the food didnt match the ambianc but i will give this place anoth tri mayb in the even becaus it look like it might be a cool place to chill and have a drinkmeh is right ive come here a few time now and have been over disappoint everi time the bartend has no clue what shes do and the food is horrifi the onli good thing i can say is the ranch and fri are pretti decent ill be take my busi elsewher from now onweve been to wolfey a coupl of differ time now and our experi have been the same  meh  i was hope for a better experi base on the owner is local and they are conveni locat but this was not the case 

good  locat locat locat  in an area where there are some mani thing go on and option to choos from it is in a good locat  they have a veri good select of beersal on tap  it also famili friendly

not so good  staff is not veri attent nor help  we order their pizza special  241 and ask for some chees and pepper  server state we onli have four shaker in the entir restaur so i dont know whi we keep offer these pizza special  she was actual impli they chang their busi model base on the number of chees shaker  we actual got better servic when we help ourselves

th food  as state by other yelper some of their food tast like it been prefrozen thaw and then reheat  we had the worst pizza and base on the left over on other tabl we were not alon with this assess  burger and fri  not fresh and over cook  their wing are not ani better  the skincrust is fall off befor you get a chanc to eat it  they were drown in a honey bbq sauc which just made these wing a gooey mess

not plan on be a regular hereask a chines person to take you hereyour experi depend on it no one speak englishand no one will tri to understand you if you dont speak chines 
mi first experi here was great i came with a fellow yelper mike c and had him order everyth my order came out and everyth fine

mi second visit was a desper one i origin stop by asian bbq and noodl but theyr close on friday  soi decid to drive across the street 

i order the beef noodl soup and ask if they could add wonton in itweird i know but i was crave both first they brought out a bowl of wonton in beef broth which is understand and forgiv becaus of the languag barrier they took it backad the beef and the noodleseveryth look great until i start eat the wonton were fall apart as soon as i tri pick them up with my chopstick i was starv so i ignor this and continu eat until i bit into one of the wonton and realiz that it was still pinkundercook gross

th servic here is non existent
they have a water cooler and styrofoam cup if you need water feel free to walk up and get it yourself same goe for napkin 

this experi was probabl an extrem of how bad a meal could go wrong herebut i will not be back this decis was made after consid that the first visit was decent there are just too mani better option in the areavega yelpers

casu indoor dine check it out and lmk what you thinkthe custom omelett my wife got with bacon avocado mushroom and greenpepp was good as were the home fri it came with my lemon blueberri pancak on the other hand were too dens and thick it was almost like tri to eat a wet dish rag it was one of the most unpleas thing ive eaten in a while the orang juic wasnt my favorit either it tast similar to frozen concentr that was too wateri on the plus side of the dine experi was the friend servic the two server were busili rush from tabl to tabl but alway seem to have a minut to chati realli want to like this place becaus i love support local howev i just didnt first of all the atmospher is uncomfort there are a bunch of young kid work there that are realli do noth they kind of just wander around stare at everyon it not pleasant it not their fault they have noth to do but the owner should cut labor and save himself a littl money 
second the food was not season at all i am not sure whi but our home fri had no salt at all and were onli partial cook 
last over 30 dollar for two peopl to eat breakfast is pretti steep i wouldnt have a problem with it if it was good but it just wasntthe hippi thought they could fool meth hippi thought i wouldnt see their littl trick with the profil change

i havent been stone in a veri long timei pay attention

so sinc the hippi were good enough to chang their yelp profil to avoid these previous review i think ill post this one under the new profile


a friend of mine call  and said let have lunch

h seem so excitedand then he said hey buddyther a brand new two hippi near old town

i threw up in my mouth a littl and said but i dont think these two hippi joint are veri good

h promis this time the experi would be better

h a lie sack ofwel you get my drift

i went anyway and had essenti the ident experi to my last and i do hope this is my last experi with the two hippies

not surpris that this place is identicalth veri same franchise oper it in the locat onc occupi by the lateand not appar lament in the slightest desert dog and dessert that oper the other two hippi joint that ive tried

two hippi is recycl the veri same thing over and over

oh well

and except for the actual physic locat and the fact that i had a pretti flavorless burrito instead of taco recycl the same review that i use befor work stun well for this locat too

and it appropri sinc two hippi seem intent on recycl their formula ad nauseum

veri green of them except of cours for the styro and plastic everyth else

plus im feel lazi today or greeni cant rememb which

her is the review for those of you still reading

i was out run a coupl of errand last week and a friend call and suggest lunch at two outrag hippi taco and beach something

i hadnt been to a two hippi for a coupl of yearsi think it was their burger jointthat one didnt make much of an impress on me either way i

but i thought to myselfwel i like lunch

and i like tacos

and i was a hippi of the first water back in my day which btw mean that it no longer my day sadly

but im not thrill by two hippi tacos

i got dos tacosa chicken and a carn asada along with a can of soda popth peopl take my 500 cash were veri nice and they were tri to dress up like hippi or someth tootoo ador for words

i didnt get fish tacosexperi the kind gain through trial and mani mani errorsha taught me that the onli place that i realli like to get fish taco is from one of the beach palapa in bahia de navidadwher the panga pull right up on the sandth fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or someth els with finsthey clean it cut it up grill it throw some lettuc and homemad salsa on it and it a taco about 30 minut after it quit swimming

thos are pretti good fish tacosesp wash down with a cerveza or threei dont rememb the name of the placeprob taco de playa or somethingjust walk down the beachyou cant miss it

10 peso each for the taco 25 peso a pop for the cervezait a veri good dealbtw that doesnt includ roundtrip first class airfar or the governor suit at the grand bay

no beach at 5th and camelback

but i digress

i like the servic and the price and i realli appreci the staff tri to look like hippi for mereallya blast from past

i realli didnt care for the food itselfoutrag has a number of differ connot depend on contextbut i didnt find the taco outrag in ani sens of the word

although nowher near as bad as skip  jan attempt at taco the hippi taco leav more than a bit to be desiredth carn asada was dri stringi bland and the salsa they give you in the littl plastic cup didnt realli improv things

so i tri the chicken taco and found it to be dri stringi bland and the salsa they gave

hey wait a minutedid they just give me two of the same thing and tri to call them someth different

that would be so like the hippi i knew back in the 60s and 70salway stone never quit sure what they were doingso much fun to watch

but no they gave me carn asada and chickenth taco just look and tast veri much alik the chicken was somewhat whiter but other than thatnot much difference

in phoenix a citi with so mani option for get my taco fix even the nostalgia for time long gone and thank socan you imagin a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day get high and make lovenot warwher would we all be  cant make up for these lacklust offerings

ther are ton of better taco shopsmani of which dont even requir the plane ride and hotel stayblech 5 burger that i could hard differenti from one of those thing wrap in foil for 3 day at ampm didnt even finish it

also the employe laugh and goof around while some serious fuck up trip bloodi homeless guy traips through the place purpos smear his blood and sweat all over the peopl and the equip didnt exact wet my appetit if he tri to touch my daughter i would have kill him with our stroller and then start in on the staff

extra star for the now bloodi pile of peanut and potato in the middl of the room that pretti funwent there today becaus i want to tri someth new the girl work the regist look like she check out complet ive work foodclerk job and i get that it about as much fun and be attack by toddler wield coat hanger but tri and at least pretend your be a profession 

the food was about as bore as you can get which when your talk about a teriyaki bowl is say someth the sushi crunch roll look and tast like it was made entir from cannedjar ingredi everyth was bland and easili forgotten the one save grace is that it relat cheap unfortun it tast that way too needless to say i wont be go back and would have been better serv go to a fast food placeuncl bear make the list becaus they carri 6 local craft beer all the time includ an ipa from four peak have said so mani other aspect of the place need serious work the servic is mediocr at best and the food is great sometim but more often disappoint exampl the prime rib slider are sometim truli wonder but on mani occas pack with more grissel than meat the wing alway seem to come out dri for the most part i believ it becaus they have been left in the servic window far to long befor reach my tabl last whi can they never cook a burger to proper temperatur those thing tend to bother me 
the staff is friend but often inattent even at the bar you must sometim flag them down as they stand in front of you these employe are not take ownership of their job 
as this pub is down the street from my hous i would love to feel better about go  would do so more often if thing were to chang for the better pick up the pace uncl bear i would love to spend my money there more often 
ps when there are onli ten peopl in the place will you pleas turn the karaok down a notch or threei wish i could give 25 star  

jim g and i frequent this place when it was enoteca san marco  even when we previous enjoy this place we recogn that this was a snack wine dessert kind of place  we were never blown away by the dinner plate  now with the chang thing seem to have gotten worse

w start with a salad we had love befor the buratta pesto capres  the chees is excel as are the pine nut  the pesto was lack and the tomato were stew instead of fresh what weird

w also share some verdur oliv plenti dish of oliv lentil alla toscana alway solid and eggplant caponata decent  our server had to use a rolodex look devic to explain the caponata to us she better have been new she was slow inattent and not too bright

w share a pasta and a pizza  both bleh we had the rigatoni with pork belli and swiss chard and chees  how is it possibl that this dish has no flavor whatsoev  one of the most bore dish ever what a wast  we also share the sausag and pepper pizza  terribl  it say pizzeria in the name  sausag was bland pizza was appar salt free and the sauc was flavorless  wast of time

i did not expect fine dine here but damn this was disappoint  usual batali place offer a minimum of qualiti  otto is sad too pricey for such mediocr food and servicdecid to drop by  grab a pie pizza i love joe bastianich but havent tri his restaur so when in vega whi not this is a restaur partnership w him  mario batali so i thought the food would be great but was disappoint we got the proscuitto arugula pizza as recommend by the waitress i love proscuitto and the ingredi for the pizza sound simpl yet delici especi w fresh mozarella

took about 20 min for the pizza i like the crust it was thin and crispi the ratio of ingredi to sauc was on spot howev i felt the pizza was way too oili proscuitto was drench in oil and veri salti the arugula was good and didnt have that bitter to it there also werent too much mozzarella  overal i dont think id come here again to pay 20 for the exact same pizza i could get at pieolog well you cant get proscuitto at pieolog but the crust and everyth els tast the sameafter come in last year and have a good time to stop in again and have the worst servic ever ive gotta chang my rate serious servic was realli bad the server repeat forgot drink we had order and then would disappear for what seem like forev 

the worst thing was my food suck i end up scarf down some of my friend bbq chicken pizza becaus my buffalo chicken pizza that sound so good in realiti was not it just tast hot like burn my mouth hot but no buffalo flavor doe that make sens it just wasnt good 

id probabl still buy the cheap drink at their bar or counter in ph but i wouldnt come and eat again stick to the drink dont tell me i didnt warn youthe ambianc and decor of addict match perfect with my birthday dinner dress that honest probabl the onli reason whi i chose to go to eat at addict for my 25th celebr on that note physicallyaddict live up to all my expect someon even said it look like a rockstar girlfriend room and quit frank i would love to be a rockstar girlfriend if i get to live in a place like addict 

unfortun plan chang and instead of stick to my 6pm reserv the gang and i decid to opt for brunch so we can make it to marque to see kaskad bust on both part while the food itself deliv quit well nobodi at the tabl had anyth to complain about it was so pain slow servic that earn them just two star we awkward walk into the dine area with not a soul there to greet us when the hostwait seat us and took our order we serious had our suspicion that he was the hostwaiterchef not even joke it took our salad and sandwich a whop 45minut to come out and we were the onli tabl there luckili i purchas a restaurantcom voucher for 50 and our bill came out to about 12person not too shabbi for a meal in vega at all

th whole set of the restaur and hotel is quit interest it almost look like an upscal motel am i addict to addict nope wont be back again unless someon els want to do their birthday therei previous gave orient hous 5 star great food great onlin order great service

not sure what has chang in the past month the menu that came with my last order said under new ownership but the deliveri servic has gone way downhil 

i thought it was a fluke a few week ago when my food took an hour and a half to arriv on a random weeknight but the same thing happen again  except this time it took two hour 

im sad to break up with orient hous they were good to me for so long but sad it time to move on to someth a littl more reliablwent to dc steak hous for dinner with my famili on a sunday night  this place was pack  i am glad that i had a reserv as peopl were be turn away  get seat was a bit of an issu  two parti that came in after us were seat befor us  i had to speak to the hostess to ensur we got seat  the food was great we all enjoy our meal  what i did not enjoy was a lot of addit charg  i did not find out the small charg until the bill arriv and no substitut are allow  so if you do not want a potato you have to pay extra for a veget  even though they are the same price on the menu  these extra charg increas my daughter meal almost 50 and this is not acceptable

th food was good but the servic issu may prevent me from returnwhat the hell happen to this place man what a dump it has becom the servic is absolut aw it was freez in there the entir time so much that i had to wear my jacket for the pain hour i was in there our drink came out about 20 minut after we order them our appet came out first and we had ano drink bno water cno silverwar you would have thought it was our waitress first night on the job  it was terribl i will not be go back ani time soon and serious fix your decor they look like crap and theyr fall apart ps the food was not great either such a bummer i use to like this placeokay okay i can feel the backlash alreadi 

but after all the hype about this place im far from be impress but yet again im not one to drive into hype 

first off whi drive away custom with a sign that expos a 60 minut wait time when you have a bunch of empti tabl wait to seat hungri patron and when we onli end up wait about 25 minut as was everyon els in front of us and behind us i automat felt pretti bad at their potenti loss of busi for those that left becaus they didnt want to wait 60 minut i mean cmon now this isnt disneyland or mayb it is becaus one of the waiter were obvious friend with a parti that came in and went straight in to be seat fast pass nice but hey it was onli a 25 minut wait so i cant complain 

now on to food 

cuz this is what so mani of my friend hype about 

i order the adobo fri rice omelett okay folk save yourselv and just head on over to aloha kitchen or island flavor now they know how to do it right if you cant make your adobo correct and expect to throw it into some fri rice and cover with a thin layer of egg then dont even bother learn how to make adobo first then tri and throw it into an omelett 

boyfriend had the loco moco pleas dont even get me start even him not be from hawaii was high disappoint gravi was bland and so was the hamburg patti which meant no flavor whatsoev cmon folk get it togeth 

and nowdrum roll please

th pancak 

macadamia pancak 

tast like generic box pancak batter not mix correct with proper measur of liquid becaus it was dens beyond belief realli pancak stick to the roof of your mouth what the and i wouldnt even have known it was macadamia nut pancak if i hadnt read it myself the white chocol chip on it was the onli other flavor asid from batter that you can tast 

red velvet pancakes

strik me now babycak fan 

last time i knew red velvet pancak is a touch of cocoa and chocol it shouldnt tast like chocol chip pancak grant chocol chip pancak are delici elsewhereidk about here but to have chewi and dens red velvet pancak that dont tast like it not accept 

so now im go to leav my littl experi to an anomal fluke becaus peopl seem to love it here and their red velvet pancak so mayb i just came in when they just werent up to par but i gotta review as i see and experi it 

will i go back maybive often use the word chinamerican to help describ food be made at some chines restaur this type american chines cookeri usual includ the same suspect like sweet and sour chicken fri rice lo mein and can be found pretti much anywher except old town scottsdal 

now the owner of geisha a go go and stingray sushi have open anoth asian concept captur the essenc of chinamerican jimmi woo while cool and modern insid they somehow manag to pay homag to the type of chines restaur i knew when i was a kid there are no white and pink tabl cloth here but the half moon shape black leather booth dim light and old school chines menu evok a 70s mod vibe be sure to check out the enorm abacus itll be the largest youll ever see outdoor woo has a fantast patio that face scottsdal road which is great for peopl watching

woo offer a daili happi hour that start at 3pm which get you drink discount and a well price small plate menu offer such as plump and juici pan fri pork dumpl 4 and a plate full of fork tender light fri salt and pepper calamari 525 are stand out if you pair these with a caraf of hot sake 4 happi hour could be a meal in of itself

look over youll notic that it all about the classic and these classic are done pretti well start with hot and sour soup 595 yes this is on everi singl chines menu around town but woo version add tofu mushroom egg bamboo and chicken make for a hearti robust soup be sure to ask for some chili past the nose clear effect is like tasti medicin 

after one bite of the chines chicken salad 895 you couldnt help but notic that while well dress in a peanut ginger dress it lack ani sort of flavor punch made with napa cabbag carrot bell pepper snap pea and scallion then top with fri noodl and almond the ingredi were vibrant and fresh hope they reconfigur their dress sinc the ad bright from citrus juic or vinegar can be key to take hohum to wow 

slight crispi tender sweet and sour toss with bit of chili and citrus peel the orang beef 1395 was decent for me this is what asian style cook is all about appeal to mani of my sens without ani one be overwhelm howev on anoth visit this dish was so over sweeten and gloopi that it was pretti much ined differ chef

i thought it was funni the veggi onli eggplant with tofu and mushroom 15 dish was one of the most expens on the menu dont get me wrong this dish was tasti with it slight sweet sauc and well cook veget it just price odd high i found it  funni that mani of the shrimp and scallop dish are price less than this one go figur 

jimmi woo may woo you with it sophist yet fun atmospher but for me it was the friend servic and their abil to make chines hip and cool i onli wish the food was as hip and coolthe skinni came in for their 12 lunch buffet and was great disappoint with the lack of select and the qualiti of some of the item for fks sake they fked up kheer 2 servic was good  noth special though 3 valu given the plethora of indian restaur offer buffet in the valley this one rank poor with regard to price select and qualiti 2

came in becaus wed heard they were start to do lunch buffet add the recent promot of 2 off we were psych to tri it out especi when it a lot closer to our neck of the woods

i was realli surpris by the lack of select avail consid the price for 12 there were 8 hot item includ rice with a small saladfruit bar and kheer

but this would be okay if the food was fantast across the board howev it miss the mark of all of the dish the standout was the goan fish curri the fish had a love textur while the curri was wonder mellow howev you were pretti much dumpster dive to look for piec of fish in the curri other than that everyth els was okay lamb masala chana masala paneer masala to notsogreat

of the not so great item was the dal bland the orang chicken soggi over sweet  im not sure how this fit in with everyth els  this st is about as american as appl pie and the kheer 

i have to take a minut about how they mess up the kheer not onli did they cheap out on the rice they use some sort of long grain instead of basmati they may have use leftov rice to make it with the rather larg clump of rice emerg from the pud if you stir the rice while you were cook it this doesnt happen in addit the rice was undercook and hard plus you dont even get that hit nice hit of cardamom at all  bleh major turn off 

the garlic naan came to the tabl nice and hot and flavour howev textur it was a littl too hard a littl too doughi and not enough flaki 

sport a tomato chutney an unpleas weak mint chutney where the mango chutney and a rather wateri raita i was disappoint by the lack of pickl and other condiment normal seen at other places

given the plehtora of place avail in the valley that offer better select better qualiti and overal better price id skip this place for the lunch buffet 2 star reviewi dont get it

our servic was no bueno our waiter rare came around and kept forget thing also they tri dust our booth in the middl of our meal i thought that was extrem tacki it wasnt even close to close or anyth they just felt like dust over our dinner 

they claim to be super healthi and fresh but start to ask question about the ingredi and fresh and youll find out everyth is rub in sugar and everyth is frozen or premad 

i went with the pork with haricot vert i order it medium but it was well done and veri dri he sat my plate down and immedi said they over cook it would you like me to take it back 

1 whi would he bring it out if it was wrong
2 obvious he didnt want to fix it or he wouldnt have even brought it to meso i didnt send it back and i just ad some salt to help it out and i didnt want to wait anoth 30 minutes

so the price combin with the food and the bad servic i wont be go backi do not care how conveni this place is to my home there is simpli no excus for them to charg 10 cent more per gallon than anywher els on charleston rd when they cannot even keep the floor of their store clean nor their lot free of vagrant beg for changi realli wish i love this place as much as everyon els doe becaus it is ridicul close to where i live unfortun it fell short of the hype

i order deliveri from biaggio and everyth went fine nice person over the phone deliveri was on time youd hope so sinc i could liter walk there my gripe was with the pizza itself along with the side order i had

iv had pizza in nyc this is not nyc style the crust is much thicker the sauc was thick and the chees made a hard layer over the top you know that kind of chees that would all just come off in one piec it was like that the crust itself had small bump on the bottom which mean it was probabl bake in a pizza tray and not just toss and slid into the oven all of this is perfect accept if this is your tast but it not for me

i order a side salad with italian dress and the salad came top with oliv chees tomato and cucumb the tomato were meali and tasteless becaus they had been in the fridg for too long the dress wasnt as sharp as id like and i end up ad some red wine vinegar at home

i order the zucchini stick specif becaus it said stick i hate zucchini round becaus when theyr cut like that they get overcook and loos their textur it also mean a lot more bread and round are alway breadcrumb i like zucchini stick that are beer batter and was hope these would be like that but knew not to expect the beer batter i was disappoint sinc i was expect stick at least

al of these thing i think most come down to a prefer but i didnt see the same qualiti everyon els did i might end up give this place anoth tri but with those guy also in the vicin itll be tough for me to break away after my first experiwarn snarki review ahead

liv room gain a star becaus i realli do like the space and i did realli want to support a neighborhood biz  unfortun they blew it

i host a month event call rogu green and held it at the live room a few month back they extend happi hour drink price to us as i had 40 peopl attend and they were still tri to build busi we had to scream over the music which never did get turn down

i also have met friend at the space on sever occas brought my kid in for dinner and have tri to give construct critic as i want them to succeed 

the music realli is aw and toooooo loud  after read all of the other review how mani time do peopl need to say it a place call the live room just shouldnt have crappi blare music it should be loungi or jazzi or anyth basic other than what it is

so in a pinch for a space for my event last week i call to see if they had room for us so i could give it one more shot the manag was suppos to get back to me to let me know what kind of special they could offer happi hour price etc  everi other place around town ive held my event has bent over backward to be accommod after all im bring in a group of peopl who drink usual eat and tip realli well i dont make money off the event and it about support local business

th manag didnt get back to me until the afternoon befor the event to inform me that the owner wasnt will to do anyth for us becaus they hadnt been hit their sale number i told her i didnt care if they even pick one beer and one wine and put them on special  just someth  as i was bring in a bunch of peopl and they usual total clear out after happi hour end and wed probabl be there until 9p she said shed talk to the owner and get back to me she didnt i call her the next afternoon and she said she couldnt reach them whatever

onc again the music at the back of the space was blare everyon had to shout i was told by the manag twice that that how the owner want it sweeti ick realli what about what your patron want there a concept eh

so most of us left and went over to the patio of main ingredi and they were nice to us and onc my ear final stop ring i actual had a good time

so stick it in your ear live room you cant move into a real neighborhood and not act neighbor your custom servic suck and so do your speaker it tooooo loud think ambianc or chang your name to live deafyep it subway with sub made your way with your choic of bread which now includ flat bread that is realli good

mi hubbi took me here for lunch one day while we were out and about run errand around town he decid to tri a flat bread sandwich and let me tell you the bread is fresh and delici i think i will tri my sandwich on the flat bread next time becaus that was a real winner

i usual get the meatbal marinara spici italian or veggi delight depend on my mood

th sub are standard at each subway what make your experi good or bad hit or miss realli depend on the employe behind the counter at the time there is no real consist as some employe are more generous then other with the toppings

it is annoy to have to ask them to add more lettuc or tomato to your sub which is necessari when you can bare see it on your sandwich on this visit i had to ask for more of everyth includ purpl onion as i kid you not she put 3 littl piec on my foot long

i dont know whi we continu to visit this locat as the servic suck sour ball it is the same ladi who look at you as if she has more import duti to do like mop the floor which while we dine she was sweep by our tabl at our feet that is a pet peev of mine sweep while i am eat we were the onli damn peopl in there at the time she could have wait until we were gone well as i have come to realiz in life not everyon has common sense

thi particular femal employe is consist in her person i have to say she look and talk as if she is give a speech at a funer she has been there everi time we have gone i swear she must be the onli employe there this was our last visit for sure she just confirm and made that decis for us 

anyhow there are lot of subway around town so it will be easi to pass this one up along the wayslow slow slow
it most sysco and shamrock servic food ya know flash frozen then thrown in a deep fryer then some special but theyr compet for the lunch busi of vermont sandwich compani next door

dur the day and weekend you have the regular off track bet client and even it so hard to find a freak park spot it cheer of east scottsdal all local and hard to break into their cliqu 

last friday their toilet were back up and no one could use them had to go over next door to use their competitor who were sympathet  friend i thought as a health code violat you had to close your door over this

but if you onli have one hour for lunch and plan to go be prepar in a slow slow afternoon return to workfiesta filipina is anoth good filipino restaur gone bad  i was in love with this place when it first open  everyth about this restaur was legit from the theme food and decor not baduy or bakya at all look classi with all the filipino paintingsdecor after more trip and a few month later it went down the same horribl path as other filipino restaur  shit servic and a shittier smell 

the servic is alway good unless you get the femal worker   bewar of the femal worker  trust she is not hard to spot  shes the cashier queen

tor up from the floor up
cak up face thicker than the earth crust
th most vibrant electr blind eyeshadow 

whenev she take our order or ring us up she alway rush  rush lead to confus confus lead to piss off custom and bad review  she kept on say extra charg for credit  so i give turon 50 cent 50 cent in her mind that mean ill say the charg is 50 cent but it realli a few buck and i wont give you ani turon 
  

i felt rape rob and broke after leav the restaur  the food was shit too 

barbecu is good but  dont use the same brush you use to bast raw meat to bast the cook one too  big mistak and health hazard 

carioka was hard tough to chew and over priced

ukoy was excus my languag the worst fuck shit ever honest do yourselv a favor and never make it again  past is what it is thick pasti batter that was slight fried

puto was pasti and a few were rotten befor the sell by or expir date

i guess if you need a filipino food fix come to this place earli and stick to simpl dishnice peopl small but dine area was clean there are some cook to order item but it main food serv up from heat tray not sure how long it been sit out  either  

got 3 item off the buffet sat down to eat took a bite of pancit and it tast a littl off like noodl were spoil it smell that way too end up  throw away my meal and walk out  i dont think ill  be backeww nofirst and foremosti do love the tea i buy from here

butand it a big butteavana need to stop pay it employe by commiss and disguis them as pleasant tea mongerswhen realli they are refin use car salesmenwomen  they would upsel you the paper your receipt is print on if they could

dont believ megoogl  teavana and custom serviceand read the reviewsit a compani wide issue

nowwhi do i go there   the tea is great  but they will have everi excus in the book to sell you the 100 teapot the 25 tumbler the overpr sugarblah blah blahyou get the pictureand it will all be under the guis of get the most flavor out of your tea

sowhat i recommend
1  walk in with a pre plan amount you are go to spendor you will walk out brokeand confus at how it happened

2  bring your own glass or metal canisteror just lie and tell them you alreadi have the small canist at home becaus no doubt they will give you a reason whi the one you brought in will loos the tast of the tea after a week

3  bring comfort shoesbecaus you will need them as they shuffl you to the right so you can paythi doesnt make sens nowbut it will when you go to paywhoev design their store flow should be fire ohand if you comment on how dumb it isth salesperson will even have a preplan answer for that alsodont believ mesay wow this seem realli  unorgan to have to pay like thisand wait for the can answer

4  let your tast bud guid you

5  do not buy sugarteapot or steeper herethey are way overpr  and when they tri to make you feel guilti becaus you are now go to ruin the qualiti of the tearemind them who the custom is

again i love the teajust the tude i get everytim i go thereit tea for buddha sakeit should be a relax zen experinacho daddi has been get pretti good review late and sinc we were close by whi not stop in 

i order the suprem tostado nacho and my wife had the daddi wing the nacho themselv were huge a lot of toppingsbut not veri much meat which was weird i cant see whi the amount of taco meat was so small on a plate of nacho that cost 13 everyth els seem right though they give you a good amount of guacamol and all the ingredi seem fresh my favorit part was the avocado lime salsa it is killer 

mi wife didnt have as much luck with her food she order the wing and ask for them extra crispi but they came out undercook and with too much sauc make them realli soggi the wing come with a dip which we ask for ranch and got blue chees no problem they got it swap out pretti quick now the problemther someth in the ranch that not suppos to be there we pull out 3 big dark chunk of someth that i think mayb the kitchen drop in the ranch and had been sit in there a while im not sure what it was but it was big soggi and nastywhen i find thing in my food that shouldnt be there it all over for me

i was go to give them one star but the waiter notic my wife stop eat her food and without us say a word he offer to take the wing off the bill we may tri nacho daddi again but it wont be for a while for me the good servic and decent nacho didnt outweigh the high price and weird crap in my foodi had a high expect for this place but yet i was let down i place an order over the phone order the 6 piec chicken end up be around 10 and onc youll sit down and open up that box youll be in a world of shock they got wing so small that your mother wouldnt believ her eye the cashier shes the owner im predict i couldnt believ she hid her babi under the regist my ladi and i was tri to enjoy our chicken then all the sudden we heard a babi cri upon observ it was come from under the registery believ it a chicken shack turn into daycar servic and the funni part as were eat the chef walk out and call me a fool im sure he call everyon a fool whoever he see like get with the program if your repres an establish you gotta be profession and not insult a custom the verdict sad to say ive experi better chicken popey is still the bestbleh 

i have been anxious await the open of this spot sinc i frequent the other spot on the same corner  i had some pretti high hope that this might end up rival postino or bombero or well someth other than a drivethru

i order the daili flatbread pizza  it was a chicken teriyaki with prosciutto pineappl and red jalapeno  the ingredi didnt seem to be of the best qualiti  the chicken was a littl grist slice breast meat would have been nice and the chees was unspeak  it was straightfromabag mozzarella which was congeal into a huge mass of greas  the pizza was so wet with sauc and greas and heavi from too mani top that i couldnt even identifi the crust it was disintegr befor my eye  the prosciutto was all in one larg clump instead of be sprinkl throughout  so disappoint  my friend capres salad was main a plate of tomato with a garnish of chees and a sprig of basil  i love a good capres  and especi enjoy when there is a fair equal amount of all ingredi  help balanc out each bite you know  no such luck with this one 

our servic was fine  help enough in the begin but i think onc she sens we werent thrill with our food she just tri to get away with a minim amount of interact  the waitress never ask me how my meal was even though i was clear pick at it and onli ate half of it  she offer to clear it away  not box it  so she must have realiz i didnt enjoy it

i will definit wait a while for a return visit  sinc it is close and has a great layoutatmospher i am hope that they work out these rather larg kink and becom the kind of place that i would like to revisitdont get me wrong this restaur did have decent good italian food  my famili had the spaghetti and meatbal chicken parm and the alfredo  all of which we enjoy but noth to merit the exorbit price of the dish  the reason whi i am give it onli two star is becaus it was so overpr  pretti much around 20 buck a mealand they even had the audac to put on the menu that there is a requir minimum of 15 a person even if you split a plate  kid meal were 1012 dollar also  just ridiculousi could see pay this mayb down on the strip but in southern highland  and on top of that they didnt even offer refil on the bread  there is no way id be back with those pricethis was my second visit in year but first time to this locat i show up fashion late to attend a birthday parti dinner took a quick trip to the restroomslik the decor of the restaurantand upon return to the tabl was surpris to see no menus nor drink order taken no plate for the bread no server around when we final got our order in it felt as though we had to repeat ask for everyth especi drink and they complet forgot my daughter drink im not picki but if my glass is alway empti the tip goe down like father like daughter i suppos i order the spaghetti vesuvius suppos to be spici it was bare abov regular sauc although the sauc was chunki it was place in a spoon a top cold bland noodlesnot enough sauc to cover it i realiz we were a big parti but reserv were made food was bland servic was slow will i return most definit nomy friend told me this place was yummi 

it was not yummy

sunday befor checkout and we decid to eat here it was fill with testosteron fill men watch footbal and yell at the tv not my idea of dine out 

lobster mac  chees was not good i couldv made it better the macaroni were tini littl noodl chef boyarde style noodl not enough lobster and def not enough cheese

fri pickl were exact what it was not a fan

calamari was actual tasti not the tradit with sauc on the side it was on the bottom of the plate and calamari on top with slice of jalapeños

th gold standard burger was ok suppos the best burger in vega but not to my standard i ask for medium and it came out well done it was too char onli tast the burnt meat the idea of the burger was awesom with age goat chees and arugula but that it just the idea was great 

i wouldnt dine here it not worth the money and experience

th short on the girl were cute it said soft bun or perfect bun on the butt but trust me their bun with neitheras a local i can give you the insid scoop on how these casinoresort restaur work

1 a talent chef design the menu and recipes
2 the restaur serv amaz food for a short time
3 account find way to cut cost
4 the food goe downhill

sad such is the way with holstein  

the first time i ate here the burger knock my sock off  the second time i wish i had just gone to applebe  it easier to park at applebe the food come out faster it cheaper and the food is better

th saddest part the resort restaur keep get away with this

that is all i have to sayi want to prefac this review by say someth veri importantther are onli a few thing that rex marvin hatesthat isnt truebut let pretend it isrex hate everythingrex hate youbut for this exers in fiction let say rex is a good man with a few unnatur hate feel  first would be hard boil egg  second the yanke and all yanke fansfront run bastard last is a common oneth french  chick dont shave they all surrend at the drop of a hat the countri could be conquer by two determin 14 year oldsquit easili  rex is a man the french have one manand he is realli a she who hasnt shave or bath for a long time onli good thing is those french broad are easier to bed than it was for the german to run past the maginot line 

i say this for a reasoni am on vicodin and dust cleanerandbecaus i was sent an invit to rex martin for a new french restaur call comm ca  insert your own comm joke hererex doesnt do low brow believ me damn you i stare down at my the my mustard sandwich mustard slather on my palm and decidedokay frenchieyou want itcom get it

i promis two thing dear readeronei am not wear pantstwomi hatr of the french is outweigh by my love of food 
when i got to the new cosmopolitan casino i wasnt impress  the park garag is like a slalom cours design by a drunken idiot  i get out of the car i borrow and walk quick for the elev i went up to the third floor and found my parti a nice group of peopl veri uptight three time peopl ask me if i plan on take the shoe tie strateg around my neck off and wear them on my feet mayb they just have a foot fetish  it was weird anyway we sat down and as i look around i was genuin confusedand the menu didnt help doe this want to be a french bistro or a gourmet restaur  truthfullyit was never realli answer  the waiter wear this hideous plaid shirt and it is so tacki for an upscal place

on the good side the view is amaz it is a perfect locat on the strip and their balconi is realli nice  againnot quit right they had a sit room and on the tv was a tabloid show  honest that is what you turn on whi have it on if someth that stupid would be playing
  
i sat down next to a darl woman sweet accommod 500lbs sweati i was in love  we share our appet  i had the bone marrow and she had the soup of the day which was pumpkin or butternut squashso mediocr i forgot and it has been a veri short time  i suck it off of her chubbi finger peopl vomit in their mouth i smile my shoe dangl brilliant the bone marrow was a revelationit was someth realli special it wasnt the best i have ever had but it was good the soupher we go againsometh that should have been good but wasnt the flavor were muddl and it was desper under season the consist was perfect velveti and creamytoo much cream actuallybut here is an ideasalt i think salt is like soap to the frenchsometh use all too spare it was a common theme 

mi main cours was the duck confit  it was okay far too small especi when i saw my soon to be huge mistresss giant steak and bucket of fri it was stagger in comparisonit was like a midget stand next to a realli small midget babi almost too hard to imagin  the portion were so far out of whack it was ridicul the steak and fri was pub food the duck confit was fine diningif it was actual done right again hopeless under season and serv with a sad littl help of herb salad onli if you consid lettuc an herb was that an herb salad  again good and bad pub and fine dine to illustr my pointther is a damn cheeseburg on this menu such a muddl concept it is hard to fathom there was ani real plan  

desertth french have to get this right not do this right would be like not watch jerri lewi movi or anal rape pepe le pewjust not right  well bend over pepe it is time for your degrad and humili let hope you are into that the pot de crème tast like whip off brand hazelnut spread decent but not good  the profiterol of my sweet chunki lover were harder than they should have beenand didnt tast as if they were made fresh the appl tart was eaten by other and enjoyed

afterward rex went to the bathroom to enjoy a littl alon time and when i walk into the main men roombetween the bar and the din roomther was one toilet it was a bathroom for one if that place is pack how the hell is one toilet go to work exact noth say fine din like wait in line for the john while i was in there someon knock to get intot ruin the mood for me i left aggrav i left chaf it was not good 

rex hate ani bad foodi have been die to tri this place becaus i am a big fan of the burger i will keep this review veri simpl for you three words

oversalted

overpriced

overrated

cheeseburg fri and drink at smashburg 10
cheeseburg fri and drink at in n out  659

how that for simplfound a bogo deal and i wouldnt come roar back here base on what we order  what we had was ok but ok just doesnt cut it in a town full of great burger choic 

got the spici baja which was describ on the menu as with pepper jack chees guacamol lettuc tomato onion spici chipotl mayo and fresh jalapeño on a spici chipotl bun  not spici enough for me  peopl who order this want to burn and it fail to do that  the patti was big and it look like a great burger but it was overdon to my liking

i like my wife sin citi burger much better  we actual end up switch halfway through  that burger was stack with fri egg applewood smoke bacon american chees grill onion haystack onion and our smash sauc on an egg bun i alway want egg on my burger  the flavor was much better than the spici baja and if i would order this if i were to do smashburg again  

what with the metal tray thing they serv the burger on  a plate wouldv been better  i found them awkward  stuff will fall off your burger and it would just be easier to scoop off someth without holebest food youv ever had in madison really

i want to like merchant i did i dine on the squar a fair bit and as far as im concern the more option the better

howev the space feel veri much like the restaur i took great pain to avoid when i live in la becaus they were too much of a scene it smaller but i get the same negat vibe

 seen a larg bar share space with a dine area and work veri well bar la grassa in minneapoli for instanc but merchant just feel cold to me  warehouselik like a bar that serv some food as oppos to a restaur that encourag you to eat at the bar the waitstaff seem veri aloof on both of my visit and charg 9 for cocktail just tip the scale further toward pretens mayb hang some art would soften it a bit and hire some nicer people

i sampl the craft cocktail and was left want same with the food mayb ill tri it again in a few moth and hope theyr abl to make some improv but theyv quit honest not given me much of a reason to give them anoth chance

 this review has been edit from it origin content after my initi frustrat experi with this establish i decid to give it anoth tri and rewrit the review with a clear mind unfortun my second experi onli echo my initi let downfirst of all the amount of new review who gave merchant 5 star sketch me out the markethybridrestaur idea sound good on paper but it not anyth special in real life

overal we agre that the experi was just kind of okay the restaur interior is pretti cool  neat layout and decor the insid is veri loud and it hard to hear anyone

food was a tad overpr in my opinion the food felt either this came from a jarcan toast or this could be good but wasnt cook well duck the sunchok risotto was great cocktail are 9 and not exceptional

il be back in a coupl week to check in but for now just kind of okay im debat between 23 stari echo jare comment earlier  the burger here are ok but certain not worth the cost although eat in vega is kinda alway overpr i had the oregon trail burger and it was your run of the mill cheeseburg kudo on nail the medium rare order request though basic everyon at the tabl felt the same  we did howev enjoy the parmesan garlic fri im not a huge fan of thin fri though but the tast was good

wouldnt come back to i love burger sinc there is alway so much els to tri in vegai went into cosmo hotel to grab an earli dinner after ces and was blown away by the decor and ambianc of wick spoon buffet we got there at right at 5pm with no wait and the cost was onli 27 for dinner afford price for such an upscal look buffet

i love how all the food was laid out and there were individu plate of all the side in cute mini plate or pot definit an a for look too bad the tast fell way short

at first i though that it was pretti tasti but ala i was just too damn starv and distract by the pretti plate to notic but after my first plate i notic that noth realli stood out i had no favorit to go back toand i just end up tri a littl bit of everyth which is almost imposs to do

rememb those cute individu plate terribl idea sometim i would onli want a bite or two but becaus i had to take the entir serv i end up with a stack of lil plate and pot on my tabl i felt super wast but couldnt bear to eat the entir serv becaus i didnt like it all that much 

plus those small serv plate avoid you from pile on differ thing at the buffet creat more than necessari trip back and forth by then you just end up get full befor you can get your money worth boo

th meat were a littl dri and whatno crab leg instead they had some kinda peel crab i think in some butter sauc of cours i wouldnt realli know becaus noth is label but regardless it was rubberi and weird and tasteless my favorit thing was the shrimp cocktail juici and plumpbut it was serv in tini plate of 2 shrimp apiec  whyyyyyyyyi is life so difficult

mi favorit part of buffet is alway the dessert bar again everyth here look stun miniatur work of art although look individu and uniqu mani of their dessert were similar in formcustard base with a fruit gel noth spectacular they also have chocol cover strawberri which i like but my favorit was the gelato the salt peanut flavor was my top pick

servic was also on the slow side it took the waiter 30 minut befor my coffe came out by then i alreadi fell asleep from the mediocr food 

pretti face but lack in qualiti substanci had to tri it  we were tire of the m except i realli like their cider and when they serv it to me in a wine glass so we want my brother to be the first in the famili to tri the cosmo buffet sinc my parent alreadi hit up the m year befor he could visit me again

w went on a sunday night  line was nonexist price reason ambianc great  our server will was fantabul  attent sens of humor super fast on drink request and refil  he gave eric r three sprite refil at one time sinc he was unusu thirsti for soda someth he never drink  the ice tea was good  definit brew and not lipton  it was sort of oolong ish  will was the onli reason i gave 2 star instead of one

y the plate are awkward  you can fit like 3 or 4 item at a time they are clunki and slide everywher  will told us he can onli clear one person mess at a time which slow down his progress  the worst for me was the lack of signag  person i dont like to put a bunch of food in my mouth that has no distinguish characterist  what the heck were in half the dish  i honest have no idea  i wasnt in the mood for an omelett so everyth was out of my control

th shrimp and crab finger  serv in pair alreadi in sauceyuk  almost everi dish i could find label or not had pork in it except carv station stuff  pasta shrimp dish cream corn you name it it was porkinfest  with limit option i didnt enjoy much except the makeyourown noodl bowl station at the end of the buffet

th dessert were wors  noth was label except the gelato  i didnt know what the hot pink goo was or the purpl fudg look stuff was so i didnt get ani of that  i ask will whi the food wasnt label  he said lot of peopl ask him that that the manag is awar but that the signag is delay on order  i would hope the cosmo has it own printer  oh well  not come back herei was realli happi to final be abl to get to tri this place but onli to be a littl disappoint their price is pretti good compar to most of the other buffet  25 for lunch 35 for dinner  most of their food is whatev it basic alot of exot food  with weird name i never heard of

i saw some differ food such as the lamb and pork meatbal  which was the most horrend meatbal that has ever touch my tongu cauliflow pure  sound pretti gross so my friend and i didnt even look twice on it and those were the onli exot thing i rememb there was also prime rib fri rice mani asian cuisin that im just total sick of their sushi tempura one was pretti good though i hate the fact that they tri to decor some food by put it in those silver cup becaus i onli get one spoon serv of each food just to tri everi food and if a food is bad i wouldnt have to worri about wast food which me and my friend did on everi of those silver can we got their mac n chees bar is a cool set where they make it in front of you but the mac n chees wasnt even that great

dessert was the one thing i was look forward to for this place but they didnt have macaroon that i was inform of most of their dessert are not even that great the best one would have to be their dark chocol cover strawberri i tri mani of the littl one and none of it realli stood out to me

overal it was okay i would rather pay 10 more dollar to hit up the bellagio buffetso disappoint by wick spoon  i was read all the rave review and drool over the pictur for week befor my trip to lv  boy was i in for a sad surpris when i came here on friday  

mi friend and i each paid near 40 for dinner and were prompt seat at a booth  i would recommend that you sit at a tabl instead for easi inandout privileg  ugh we had quit a time get up and scoot around for each other

anyway the food was old  serious a major of the dish that had sauc on them alreadi had an ugli old crusti or filmi look and textur around 630pm  that should be like the prime time for dinner but they didnt put out fresh food for the longest time  i get that sometim busi is slow but if you keep leav gross look food out who will want to eat it  it just a neverend cycl you know

i was super unimpress with the varieti of the even  a lot of the good food i saw on the yelp album were not avail and near everyth i ate was super butteri  i like butter as much as the next person but shouldnt there be a variety

also for some reason the food made 34 of my girlfriend ill for the rest of the night  not  cool  we came to vega to stuff our face not to cleans our colons

in term of park tri to park on the west side of the lot  we park on the east side and had to walk about 5 minut to the buffet  this is not an issu for me but it fair warn for those who are lazi or are with peopl with mobil issuthere are some thing that are worth wait in line for  like niner super bowl ticket ticket to la galleria borghes or an adriana lima kiss booth  but wick spoon buffet is not one of them 

the line here is depress not onli is it long it move slower than a tsa secur check point worst of all is the mirag end onc you think youv final come to the end you realiz that was just the line to pay wait  there is a a  second line just kill me now

onc you final get insid the food is disappoint at best the onli real highlight was the bone marrow 

if you decid to come here make sure you upgrad to the bottomless drink 9 for bloodi mari mimosa which can be mix and match they are the perfect way to fight back a hangov while also creat your next one  cheerit funni i had breakfast here a few month ago the food was fine but i walk out think that the staff just seemedwel dickish my server brought me one water and i never saw him again i stop a differ server to ask if perhap my guy was on break he said no and walk away not ill get him for you or even the ideal answer how may i help 

but wick spoon has a bunch of solid review so i held off on write mine until i could go back for a second opinion

today was that day

i walk in with three friend and approach the cashier short after 2pm her greet to us did you hear what she told those peopl 

huh did we hear what who told whom

rol her eye to the next cashier the bundl of hospit sneer she said were close we close at two 

well excus the fli fock out of us mayb someon could post a sign to that effect at the entranc mayb you could get off your lazi ass and click the velvet rope thingi across the entranc to the zigzag wait line chute either of those would work sinc you clear do not have the person necessari to communic the inform verbally

i hadnt told my buddi about my first impress of the servic here but everi one of us left with a last impress this time 

the cashier could have use fewer word and frank done her job by simpli be oh i dunnopolit she could have said i am so sorri gentlemen buffet seat end at 2pm daili so we can begin set up for dinner servic pleas come back and see us but shed rather be a bitch no not just a bitch a bitch who was so goddamn lazi she tri to get us out of there by reli on the other cashier verbiag to some other guest that we never saw

cosmopolitan my ass

actu im sorta happi thing went down this way the bitchi clerk manag to confirm everyth i walk away feel the first time and i didnt have to blow 25 on the buffet this timethought we would give this place anoth tri  it been a year so mayb theyv up their game  

the onli thing they up was the price  

39 for friday brunch and no that doe not includ a singl mimosa  that cost you 10 more  sure it a holiday weekend but that is just wrong  

oh hell no that was not worth it in the least  in fact i think the food was a littl poorer in qualiti than last time we were there  much less select than last time for sure

wel 2 strike  might not make it to a thirdim pretti sure that the cosmopolitan realiz that it is lose too much money and thus has cut it budget on the alreadi losslead known as the wick spoon

from the previous review it seem that the wick spoon has come a long way from be a 5 star experi to a 23 star experi for it price

th first problem encount was at the entranc when we saw that a gold brick had fallen off and thus left a giant white hole on the wall where it was suppos to be this mean that they have reduc the amount of mainten worker for the restaur this also should not happen in a five star resort partner with the ritz

th second problem was that there was almost no varieti when we came this time the worst part of it all was that the sushi was for display onli realli 

the third problem was that they start to clean up at around 745 pm they close at 9 pm mean no more fresh food after that save for a coupl of dish no more dessert too basic that mean i was unabl to eat ani of the suppos good stuff

bi the way they i believ they save those dessert for the next morn im serious i saw them neat stack them on a tray obvious not intend to dispos of them

som of the food was pretti good though but this isnt close to be a valu for it price the gnocchi with a sweet corn emuls was realli good i do believ that they purpos tri to use subpar ingredients

i happen to ask our waitress for her opinion and even she said that it isnt worth it for dinner although breakfast seem to be a better valu she also happen to hint that chef here are constant replaced

servic is impecc howev our waitress was liter superwoman the path for the waiter and waitress to walk through was poor design they are forc to walk through a maze

thi place realli is total hype from a pure busi standpoint i wouldv cut the budget on this buffet too 4 billion is a ton of money to repay to deustch bank analyst have calcul that this hotel will not reach profit in this decad that mean more cut are expected

liv on lost reput is okay but you can definit see that some peopl realiz what has happen there werent as mani low rate im not sure if they even had ani in the first two year they open but late the low rate have been increasing

th park here suck too1111111i came here for dinner with keri w and gardenia h last year sinc we had heard realli good thing about this buffet locat at the cosmopolitan this buffet took a lot of walk to find and the line to get insid was ridicul but we persev and wait for what seem like forev befor we were final seat i want to get to everi singl station and i almost did

for my first plate i tried
 tomato and cucumb salad light and refreshing
 bruschetta i love bruschetta but was not a fan of the one here
 deli meat and cracker your typic meat with cracker good but noth special
 shrimp cocktail just okay the shrimp didnt tast veri fresh
 shrimp cevich same here
 tomato gazpacho this was also just okay

i also got bread with garlic butter i love my carbs

for my second plate i tried
 bbq shrimp and grit these were actual pretti good the grit not so much but i do love shrimp
 fish and chip i could be bias sinc i dont like fish to begin with but i didnt like the fish here the chip were also just mediocre

mi third plate was also savouri food
 mash potato cant go wrong with this
 rotisseri pork shoulder not as tender as i want it to be

 appl streudel tart decent but a littl dry

a you can see i tri a lot of the food here and i found most of it to be pretti mediocr they did do some thing well but not as well as i had hope i will admit that i came in here with high expect and i was probabl a victim of those grant it doe seem like this place doe brunch better than they do dinner but overal i was disappoint in the qualiti of the food here especi consid their reput and the price of the mealthis review is for the breakfast brunch on 1224 onli  at christma price we got here at about 1pm and yeah 42 a person for brunch there was noth here that justifi the pricing

i onli had the korean kalbi top sirloin a slice of turkey a cocktail shrimp in a shot glass a piec of pork belli and dessert that it i didnt want anyth from the omelet bar it was past 2pm where the seafood the crab leg noth 42 serioussummari attend wick spoon for a wed so realli i dont know how much it is per head and i dont intend to find out the set was dark which i dont understand whi do they not want us to see what were eat but after sampl major of their food i assum the dark is so other guest doesnt see me split out the food

food their weekend dinner select was below averag noth stand out or mind blow the onli thing i can actual compliment on was their salmon which wasnt bland and their shrimp cocktail the sauc was differ it was sweet and sour at the same time and the tast wasnt too strong on the palat i would avoid the desert section flavorless and full of sugar 

servic the staff was veri friend though i dont know was it becaus we book a privat room so we have person server but they were veri attent and alway on time to refil our beer and wine the staff was veri profession throughout our stay which i understand can be tough at time especi you know asian and their endless alcohol 

overal of all the buffet i experi in vega i think ill stick with bellagio for the time be until someon recommend we tri a new place but definit wick spoon is off the tabl permanjaleo is locat at the cosmo where all the other resto are 

we had reserv and we were come a tad bit late i call in ahead of time just to let them know i was run around 510 minut behind

upon arriv i apolog for be late the hostess carri an arrog attitud which unfortun left a realli bitter tast in my mouth  we were seat about 20 minut later at a tabl that had been unoccupi for about 15 minut 

luckili we had a realli sweet server who offer fooddrink suggest the restaur is well lit with veri modern furnitur the ambianc is trendi just about fit for it patrons

their menu is fair larg which i appreci we got
1 pan con tomat 
2 croqueta de jamon
3 fri date in bacon
4 carn asada
5 chorizo wrap in crispi potato
6 pork and foie gras canelon with bechamel sauce

everyth was just ok definit not worth the exorbit price for soso cuisine

but i will say that that the onli redeem factor about this meal was the pork and foie gras canelon  it was sin rich flavor and i just wish i had moreallow me to prefac i seldom give 1 or 2 star a lot had to be miss for ani dine establish to fall in this categori 

it was a saturday night at the cosmopolitan hotel  casino  h and i were in a hurri to grab a quick bite befor head to the marque night club  the cafe would sure prepar a hearti meal but as the minut tick away we knew that time was not on our side  luckili or unluckili in this case china poblano jump out of nowher and had a sign that said to go or take out  instant im think it kinda like taco bell fast but let just say that were lucki to get our food in less than 20 minutes

th menu was a fusion of chines and mexican food  uniqu not realli  anybodi can make ani type of meat and throw it in a tortilla shell and call it mexican food  anybodi creat this type of concept need to think it through to creat a uniqu dine experi for everyon who pass through the door  comeon peopl travel from all over the world to come to vega  is this is best meal the cosmo can offer  i believ not

th pork siu mai were a disgrac to chines peopl who invent this dish   i have eaten this all my life in oc  la  even sf and have never seen anyth so tini  it was liter the size of a quarter all 6 of them look pretti sad and lone in this takeout contain that it was toss into  no shred lettuc or cabbag for garnish  just 6 puni littl siu mai squish to the corner of the contain  i finish them in 2 minut and natur was not full at all  the tast  it was ok not spectacular

th taco that h had were anoth dismal dish that appear from the same menu  i cant quit comment on the tast but the size was disappointing

th price were not cheap both microscop  macroscop item came in slight less than 30  what  doe money grow on tree  asian are taught to get the best bang for the buck and to bargain our way through life this time i felt jip  helpless  left the establish with a more than half empti stomach  feel robbed

th experience
ok grant we order takeout but there was no place to sit outsid in the hallway of the hotel  it just not sexi or classi to eat in the hallway  meanwhil insid the bar was complet empti as in zero zip zilch nada patron  we ask the girl clean the bar if we could pleas sit there for a few minut and she said yes then like a bat out of hell the hostess storm over and said we cannot sit there  what  did you not realiz we were not fight for seat but actual make your establish appear fuller than it is  so she escort us to these bench behind the bar with pillow that we could sit in  for all the commot that she caus by move us we couldv finish our food in the 2 minut that it requir to consum our socal meal

in conclusion
thi place is not suitabl in such a gorgeous hotel as the cosmopolitan  it doe not compar to it eleg it grandeur and it sophist  the peopl who work there need to grace better manner and accommod it patron a littl better

i would high suggest you save your money and go to the cafe downstair or win a coupl of hand in blackjack and eat at blue ribbon sushi or stk insteadget readi for the most rush dine experi of your life at one point while i was bite into a taco i had a server reach over my head to grab a plate realli guy 

the food here is total bullshit 550 get you one taco with a dri factori made tortilla some dri meat and here the showstopp  pickl onion boom gourmet dude ive had better taco at some of the most ghetto taqueria and the price was noth close to 5 fuck fifti get a grip oh yeah it vega boom roastchina poblano is such a wast of money do not come here as i was walk through cosmopolitan i didnt realli pay much attent to this littl asianmexican joint becaus it look like an unappet fast food spot but what did catch my eye was jose andr name plaster in front of the restaur  ive fallen in love with jose andr ever sinc my enjoy experi at the bazzar so i just had to tri it  of cours i knew it wasnt go to be the same but this just wasnt even good for ani type of standard  i want to tri an item from both side so i opt for the lobster taco and their dan dan mian noodl  the lobster taco was about 10 and the noodl were around 16  both were extrem overpr for what i got and i honest dont mind fork out the cash for good food but this did not even come close  the portion were extrem small for both not to mention that my lobster taco was soggi  the dan dan mian noodl were suppos to be one of their more popular item and i can tell you that there are about a million place in 626 that do it better for about 6  i regret come here and shouldv just gone to secret pizza  china poblano how dare you taint jose andr reput like thati am veri turmoil about this place ive seen it sever time and my guitar instructorfriend has been here 5 time and love it everi time i had big expect 

thursday night the middl of the pac 12 tournament week around 9 oclock in the even not too crowd but peopl were scatter around the edg of the restaur with all the room in the restaur we end up sit at a tabl against a wall nestl in between about 4 other tabl a super tight sardin type squeez 

our red head male waiter did not come around for awhil but we watch him attend to the tabl direct to the right of us and a few tabl left of us i kind of felt like we were play that childhood game red rover wonder if i was ever go to get pick and the anticip was kill me i just want to order 

he final come over with his rehears speech yes my hubbi and i order margarita and then he disappear for a long time again befor we get to order food

fast forward sometim later the guacamol and chip hubbi choic make their appear first veri good stuff not mind blow but definit worth a try

i enjoy my air foam top margarita and my chili pepper spici margarita i had one of the most uniqu taco i ever had  a duck tongu  lyche corn tortilla taco although i realli enjoy the duck taco i definit like the beef lengua taco more sinc the duck tongu taco was too uniqu for my tast i also love the hao gao dim sum  the insid combin pork and shrimp when it usual just shrimp veri tasti stuff the six piec disappear in my tummi quickly

i also order a carnita taco but it never came out i inform the waiter of this and he said i never order it i could have sworn that i did what happen next we receiv our check and the carnita taco was on the bill the suppos taco that i never order i think the manag notic my deject look he came over and ask us if we were okay and we told him what happen our waiter never return but the manag help make the correct on the bill and sincer apolog 

mi summari food veri interest manag and hostess veri friend and nice waiter  i think you were have an off day or honest forgot about us you probabl were tire or overwork and were readi to be done with the day we had come in from a long road trip and just want to relax and have drink and food it was just a bad date between us and the restaur that nightbeen put off updat this review sinc my last visit in mid decemb 2011 when i learn that the old dragon hous is no more  sure the name is still the same but oper under a differ manag with a more conciseabridg menu option and possibl the chef is new too

anyway i was in the area after watch one of the nfl game and decid to drop in for dinner  the place still look the same but the staff are all differ and the menu i was given was differ too  i ask and the young ladycashi confirm that the restaur has recent chang owners

th new menu now is pretti much a cooki cutter generic american chines restaur menu at least for now  i hope  gone are the crab lobster calamari and fish that were on the old menu which was one of the main reason for drop in for a seafood feast at the dragon hous  what you get now are your typic chicken beef pork chines takeout menu with the onli seafood option be shrimp and 1 fish probabl frozen cod or tilapia entree

th food i order and ate was prepar quick and proper noth realli wrong with it except it just lack that certain pizazz i have come to appreci in the former dragon hous  i will still come back and give it anoth tri if i happen to be in the area but in it present generic chines takeout incarn there is realli no point in drive out of the way for it offering

decor 35 it is still a hole in the wall with littl or no new facelift sinc the new manag change

servic 35 the ladi that was the cashier spoke perfect english and was profici in her job but the new waiter still seem a littl lost

food  25  it is still made by a chines chef but the menu took out that extra bam when it got zap with a deevolut ray

pricevalu 35  generic price for generic american chines takeout food  no longer the great valu it use to be

loc 25  not in the best part of town and definit not in the best lot in that part of town  without the yummi chines food at a terrif price i am not sure if it is worth it to ventur out of your way herelvrw2012 restaur week if for anyth other than chariti is light consid an opportun for peopl to experi a restaur they wouldnt normal enjoy in their everyday lifeusu for the first time diner often need an excus to eat out and spend money frivol i am one of those diner becaus eat at a fine dine restaur a few time a week just becaus is a ton of empti calori and quit time consum at first glanc blue ribbon prixfix restaur week menu stand out as a good one you have the choic of two app for your first cours a tast of sushi three entre of which onli one look good and a dessert but that excit is let down soon after the third course

th bisqu was except with larg chunk of sweet tender meat the heat warm the cloud of wasabi crème on the surfac when combin with the soup it realli compliment the lobster flavor upon further investig i found this is not on the regular menu general im against nonmenu item on lvrw menus but i was satisfi by this course

th spici tuna roll was by the book no disappoint no intrigu and as a pleasant surpris it was serv alongsid a piec of chutoro and hamachi im not fond of amberjack but the tuna was pretti good 

the pork cheek and trout entre are not on the regular menu and everyon swoon over the blue ribbon style fri chicken at 26 this luxuri fri chicken had the potenti to be great it coat light with matzo meal and flour then season with a spice mix of togarashi paprika cayenn and sea salt whatev uniqu standout flavor i was search for was overtaken by a vat of old oil it was serv with a dip sauc made withsuppos realwasabi and honey speciallyimport from mexico now that i would pour on just about anyth but it just cant makeup for that stale oil taste

th chocol bruno is rich dens and extrem chocolateladen and was suppos to be serv alongsid a green tea ice cream they were out of green tea and substitut chocol ice cream without let us know first just what i want more chocol i sampl a bit of the gingerbread pud the clear winner of the two 

am i impress no would i go back yes but onli to settl the rumor that their oxtail fri rice is realli the magnific creatur they say it is after the fri chicken fail i wouldnt be surpris if it wasnt worth the 30i was excit when my row mate on the plane told me that popo had open a second locat take over an old garcia i was total bum that this popo was kind of poopi compar to the origin one in maryval 

i order a chees crisp and it was so sad i almost cri the chicken taco was decent and the rice and bean were the requisit decent as were the chip and salsa what total suck was the fact that their guacamol is someth green not real avocado mix with sour cream fals advertis and i can just imagin what ani lactos intoler person would have to deal with if consum this thank not one of my issu i manag to order a coupl of side of avocado slice some lemon and use their decent salsa to make my own guacamol i grew up on arizona mexican food this was not right on so mani levelsexcept for our server who was ador and accommodhigh prais for the attent servic and friend staff but that about it

th experi began with cocktail a fruit martini tast almost clinic due it unbalanc high vodka low fruit ratio and a manhattan order with onli one or two rock serv up in a full glass of ice two for two thus far

th lobster salad valentin day menu a mountain pile of frise with a few small chunk of lobster buri deep within made for a nice game of hide and seek as i watch my date feverish pick through the lettuc in search of what littl lobster was embed within

th cedar plank salmon entre was anoth huge disappoint 
a good cedar plank salmon should have the aroma smoke color and caramel of well cedar plank salmon 
this was anyth but 
this salmon while cook proper was tasteless other than it normal salmon flavor
now plop it onto a flat nonfluffi pile wet soggi serv of cous cous and youv realli got a plate of disappointment

w also order the duck which was deliv roast and rare 
so rare it was like cut raw chicken due to it be so flubberi but again as i mention the staff was extrem help in bring out a new plate of duck this instead of the kitchen simpli heat up the unwant serving

aft this level of disappoint dessert were out of the question but interest enough our server never even offer us to see a dessert menu 
how weird is that
it was like he had esp

throughout dinner a woman we surmis a floor manag pace the dine area as if overse the staff too bad she didnt stop by to inquir how our meal was or if everyth was alright anoth disappointment

iron if you read other yelp review of tanzi near all of them featur a manag respons either prais yelper for their high mark or apolog for their less than stellar experi 
tanzi pleas there no need to respond

i dont want an apolog or some lame reason whi thing werent the way they shouldv been im afraid that would be much too littl too late
th time for that was while we were still captiv within your domain

what you should do instead is
gordon ramsey your execut chef
mak the mixologist sampl his  her creation until they bleed vodka out of their eyes
and final have the person frantic pace the aisl put a smile on her face and actual interfac with the patron ask about their experi seem pretend to give a pooi hate to slag on this place sinc their locat on west flamingo is one of my go to spot  but i gotta call it like i see it  

for reason i wont go intoim vegetarian for the month of januari  i am pretti much hate it so far and im onli 5 day in but i figur i would tri this place out sinc they offer a few thing the wflam locat doesnt  these thing includ gyro beef shawarma and falafel  

i got the falafel plate sinc the onli altern was a falafel burger  i wouldv order a falafel sandwich w pita had that been a choic  

the atmospher is pretti much set up for peopl on the go  i imagin peopl on convent might get a quick bite here  drunk bastardsbitch would be fine here sinc theyr open til 3am daili and all their furnitur is plastic  

so i was a bit excit when they brought out my plate  4 huge falafel ball along with the usual thing shish kabob hous offer like the roast pepper and tomato  but they dont includ salad at this locat and the rice isnt as good here  

mi excit complet die as i had my first bite   dri blandalmost like eat an overdon oatmeal raisin cooki and it kinda crumbl like it too  they also serv a side of super thick kinda tzatziki sauc which didnt go too well with it  i would have much rather had tahini or hummus but i am not shell out 495 for a side order of it  realli unsatisfi  

i have no question that their kabob menu is just as excel as the origin locat but they shouldnt be serv falafel here  the w flamingo locat is better to go toambianc even though they use fold tabl side salad with your entre and music from their countri as oppos to fuse tv play at the strip location

i might be back herebut itll onli be for lamb chopfour star for the food and the fact that it so close to my hous  but i have to give the place 2 star overal for the ownerhead waiter  hes so sur and gruff  im sure he think hes funni and there are some custom that think the same but hes just a pain in the butt  this is not some new york deli or dick last resort  it a small place that depend on keep local folk in mountain edg happi  be polit and courteous  leav the sur attitud for anoth venu032313 dinner

i was tempt to give this place onli 1 star but sinc the ownerserv was a nice guy i went with 2 stars

on 022712 spous and i had dinner here we brought a groupon along and as it turn out it was worth the long drive and price for what we had spous realli like the chicken fri chicken

so a few month ago a repeat of the groupon was offer i got one

wel we were extrem disappoint this time it had a few up but most downs

w came this night for their announc saturday night special which i will copi verbatim from their facebook page it saturday march 23rd andtoday special isroast turkey breast with darrel homemad cornbread stuf this is delish serv with fresh mash potato and gravymad from the drip mm mm good veget dinner roll and choic of homemad soup or crisp green salad

w arriv i saw a sign at the front door announc saturday  sunday onli check in with facebook and get unlimit mimosa for 10 or half price bloodi mari i said to myself whi not and proceed to check in i show my phone to the ownerserv darrel and he said oh that onli offer at brunch and as i dont own the bar i cant make that offer for dinner it a tavern with him darrel subleas the restaur side of the build that fair enough it similar to what carluccio did move from the liberac center to a henderson tavern but he darrel proceed to bring us a free basket of fri mozzarella stick which was veri nice of him darrel and were actual pretti good

w got the bloodi mari after all and it was one of the worst ive ever had whi for one my oliv was previous attack by a bug no lie a chunk bit out of it obvious insecteaten and the cocktail tast metal i probabl shouldv return it but then there were those free moz stick sit there

aft order said saturday night special next up were cup of soup or salad i got the homemad chili which was good spous got the salad and was quit happi it even had dandelion green in the 225 year of live here in vega i dont think weve seen those in a salad was it a packag salad if it was it was surprising

but then the main cours come it was not turkey breast it was turkey loaf lot of white and greydark meat slice from a loaf perfect circular fall to piec it was ok but it wasnt anyth special or worth the price charg and the veg the green bean we forgot about this part from the last visit they were sad can remain was some cranberri sauc ok like can no problem the potato a small scoop of homemad these were good the dress also seem homemad good and the gravi which i think wasnt from drip becaus the last time i cook a turkey loaf i dont recal all that mani drip so we think it was bottledpackag the dinner roll was a version of texa toast no garlic just a grill roll

didnt order the homemad just out of the oven peach cobbler offer by the ownerserv darrel we prompt left after dinner a lot of the turkey loaf came home for the kitties

if i hear theyv improv we might again make the trip out there but i doubt that will happen

p one other problem we arriv to find a coupl of uncontrol kid run around the veri small restaur at time scream it continu throughout most of our visit i guess the word famili in the name of the place shouldv been a clue of the possibl of an undesir child carniv suppli by their uncaringofotherpatron parent at the same age as those kid if i had behav that way in a restaur with my navi command father at the tabl i wouldv been beaten to a pulp time have certain changi have been here befor but this was first experi for breakfast love the chicken fri steak egg and potato also good the hot cake aka pancak were over done and gross could not even cut with fork had to use knife also the mapl syrup was more like color corn syrup no mapl flavor at all biscuit and gravi were bomb though  servic pretti good until they wouldnt let me use my groupon becaus it was a holiday i didnt see anywher in restaur or on fine print in groupon that i couldnt use when guy didnt even apolog and just said i have to use next time i left with bad tast in mouth spend twice as much as i want to   if i want full price i would have gone to anoth breakfast place close to home not  realli sure i care to returnwent here for the first time hope to find a nice casual italian bistro weeeeeelllll not exact it modern look at first glanc if you walk in and didnt know the name you probabl wouldnt guess italian cuisin by look at the decor
th menu is short not overload which is niceth staff was pleasant and knowledg the diin room was comfort w a small bar but the music was blare and left me feel like i was in a bar not a restaur calamari is the best app we had w a zesti sauc and a kick of red pepper seed we order the mussel but they were too twist for me with a sweet white sauc that overpow ani flavor the small mussel wouldv had they were tender  tasteless we order a salad w gorganzola chees but instead of crumbl we got gorganzola dust mayb it was just the bottom of the bag the bread is like a subway roll and the pizzetta  their version of domino artisan pizza was ok but the crust didnt tast like fresh pizzeria dough at all i have a sneak suspicion it brought in or frozen  weve got three littl girl who all had pasta w butter becaus the red sauc onli come with red pepper flake alreadi mix in so we had to send them back not a good dinner choic for kid we didnt order desert  all toll we were out the door for 100 w tip and my wife is not a generous tipper

sid note  my one daughter want to go to pei wei where we drop 45  and dont mind hittin coldston afterward for 16 the netnet is you alway have to tri a place onc but given that phoenix has so mani choic to offer there has got to be a wow factor to bring peopl back 
this place is probabl a better choic for a date night for two   i give it a 55 outta 10 san marzano plum tomatoyou walk in and are greet by espn on the tv gypsi king on the radio and a bbq restaur that almost exclus serv gourmet mexican  talk about an ident crisi  we wound up order mexican and everi dish was underwhelm and not worth the price tag  they also charg our parti of 6 a 20 gratuiti to boot  

guy i recommend you go back to the draw board and come up with a consist concepti realli want to give a better rate becaus i love the vibe and the food is great unfortun the servic has been so aw 90 of the time i alway get ignor for a while when i walk in then the feel i am irrit them by order  also i have wait 3050 minut for a sandwich most time ive gone i realli want to like this place realli hope manag can get the rude too cool for school employe in check also i have never been compens for wait almost an hour for food  one guy has been veri friend though i had been wait for this conveni place to open but it took me a littl while afterward to get around to eat here  i wish i had read the review first  anyhow here how it went for me here today at a littl after 11 am

good  i found this new place to be clean  comfort insid with both booth  tabl  this was my first visit to a federico  you order at the counter  then they call you to pick up  i order a 12 two chile relleno plate  it come with tortilla  i ask for corn  also a shred beef hard taco to go along with it sinc i was pretti hungri  want to be sure it was enough food

not so good  back at the tabl i notic that my ticket had the 17 chile verd plate on it with corn tortilla rather than chile relleno with corn tortilla  i went back up to the counter  the girl said she would fix it

not so good  it was a  rather long time later when my number was call even though the restaur wasnt busi  a person who work nearbi with a halfhour lunch break would never have been abl to eat the food befor they had to leave

good  my plate came out pile high with food  look realli attract  the chile had a big dollop of guacamol  also sour cream on top  there was a littl salad plus generous serv of refri bean  spanish rice

not so good  i start with bite of bean rice  a piec off the end of one of the chile  my plate food was all just bare warm  almost room temperatur     o

not so good  i unwrap my tortilla packag  the tortilla was hot but it was flour  i order corn  that was print in red on their copi of my receipt

not so good  they use anaheim chile for the relleno  by the time theyr bread  cover with sauc  the two top you can bare tast the chile  they were too mild for this recip  if they want to use long skinni chile they should have been nu mex big jim like the other restaur around the valley give you  otherwis use a big pablano  onli serv one

th onli thing that save this place from one star was that the flavor of the bean  rice was good  the portion of everyth generous  i didnt need to have order the side taco  they do realli feed you here but they need to tighten up the ship  a lot     o

12 chile relleno plate 659 shred beef hard taco 209brought to you by the contractor that run the dine hall and starbuck on the asu downtown campus aramark  appar they are also open until 1am 6 day a week toohummm

stop in on my way home from work hope to find some veggi  on first glanc through the place i was excit think cool my own salad bar near home then as i  took a closer lookth qualiti of said veggi well that was anoth story

th employe probabl never eat salad or veggi by the look of the dri wilt zucchini cucumb celeri carrot bok choy
to their credit the main pile of spinach romain and mix green were fresh  the side salad look like they had been sit out all day as did the dress  
either cover the item take the time to stir the saladsdress or put out less and replenish frequent  all of this could be resolv with a swift kick to the ass of some obvious lazi employe 

i want to take my salad to go and they charg by weight but i was not given a to go contain   i was told to use a plate put it all togeth and then i had to dump it in to a contain after it was weigh  huh  

these plate are huge and plastic and i doubt that they tare out the weight of the plate  i didnt get a whole lot of salad consid the qualiti of the top and it came to 9  wtf i can get the whole kit and caboodl at souper salad or even sweet tomato for that price or less  i rare even pay that price at whole food when carri out a salad there  

no wonder this place was empty

i wish this place was better7 for a small styrofoam bowl of bland white mush atop rice  can you tell i am less than thrill and my negat onli grow with my hunger just 2 hour after my meal

it was anoth food truck friday in down town phoenix the number of truck grew sinc last year and hey joe was one the new one to me  from glaze at the menu the onli veggi option was the vegan mungo for 7 so i went for it  it came in a small white styrofoam bowl look anem like babaganoush with a few leav of spinach  i was hope for more flavor but it was not there the textur was like a indian lentil dish

whi was this 7 it should have been 350 at most sure it came from a truck with modern graphic on it this doe not mean it is instant gold truck may be trendi but so far the food qualiti has yet to impress mearrog butcher continu to disappoint  i came here on friday to celebr someon birthday  the pretzelfondu appet was awesom as alway but im begin to suspect that it the onli good thing on the menu  and realli that not veri impress becaus how could they possibl mess up salt bread and melt cheese

w were head to the art museum after dinner so i decid to order an appet for my meal sinc i knew i couldnt finish a whole entre and i didnt want to lug leftov around with me on the lightrail  at first i order the steam mussel but sad they were out of them for the night  my second choic was the salmon rillett which the menu describ as smoke salmon with crusti bread  i was expect a lox and french bread type of plate but what came out was smoke salmon that had been mush up into littl chunk soak in some sort of liquid tast like vinegar mayb pour in a jar and top with mani caper  i gave it a tri and spread it on the bread but after 2 bite i knew i did not like it  it was mushi and sour and yecchh

i was wait for the bartend we sat at the bar to come by and ask if we enjoy our food so that i could exchang my salmon for a salad or someth but she never did  she onli came at the end of our meal and collect my plate still full of food except for the 2 bite miss and threw all the food in the trash  you would think the plate full of uneaten food wouldv clu her in that i didnt enjoy my meal but either she didnt notic or didnt care but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment  i didnt want to be fussi so we paid and left

mi dine companion order the jambalaya for his meal and said it was realli greasy

arrog butcher you make me angri that you charg so much money for bleh food  i will not be convinc to come here again no matter how good your pretzelfondu isoverr serious frustrat aka the case of the miss san marzano tomatoes


edit it seem i have irrit the owner of due forni with my review which i will leav as written below here whi 

i take my yelp elit status veri serious and i am keen awar of the power that a good or especi a bad yelp review can have when you write a 1 star or 2 star review you realli need to think it through i spent 45 min alon on my drive back to henderson think about my experi at due forni and look at the black box sit in the seat besid me when i got home i tri the pizza again the review i wrote was written with about 3 hour of thought put into it and i took the time to ask the question am i be fair 

as my profil state i am from missouri the show me state i go with what is present to me and the experi and product that i see first hand and i call it as i see it with that be said and now with even more deliber put into this my origin review will stand i wrote it i stand behind it and im sorri that i am appar in the minor of due forni custom who did not like their experi at their establish but that be said there is a good chanc i will return as vega is a citi that love second chanc and i love to give them when i go back i will bring other and will onc again call it as it is 

i appreci the fact that the busi owner took the time to reach out and make contact when an owner doe that it show that they care and that warrant a star in it own right so this review get a slight bump to 2 star 


this is suppos to be one of the best pizza place in las vega it got accolad it got we won this or that sign on the counter yadda yadda 

phooey it aint all that not even close 

decor wise it not bad for an upscal strip mall servic is actual too good too attent pleas id like to eat and i can take care of thing without you hover or watch me while servic was of the helicopt parent varieti when i wasnt deal with the server i look around the place the outdoor seat is nice and the interior old school style light is cool as can be edit 2  my server anni seem to have notic i was not have a good experi and she did make some recommend for a futur visit in the interest of fair i do need to mention that

on to the pizza which is the onli reason whi i came here i want a thin crust pizza that would knock my sock off i end up order a due forni roman style when your first ingredi on the menu for this pizza is san marzano tomato i expect to tast them ive ate mani of them i know them well what i got was a blast of the sausag which overpow everyth els i tri pick the slice apart to tri the individu item and again the san marzano disappear while i love the mozzarella and pepper it just wasnt the balanc pizza i was hope for in short it not settebello it not even in the same leagu as settebello compar due forni to settebello would be like compar reno to las vega both are citi but that about where it stop 

and let talk about the crust the crisp on the outsid soggi in the middl crust pull from a plastic tray dough that just didnt impress me at all it bad when benni blanco in denver with their hole in the wall locat and old high school cafeteria style oven can kick due forni rear end on crust count me as flat out not impress not even a littl bit 

i am run out of haterad so let just say this this place is a pretend to the throne of best pizza in vega grimaldi kick due forni ass old school pizzeria kick their ass but settebello outclass them there realli no comparison 

i dont care how good the rest of their menu is if they claim to be a pizzeria they have to bring it and if theyv got accolad my expect are set right up there with those accolad due forni just doesnt cut it summari extrem disappoint 1 star is push it and consid the size of the check settebello whip their ass on price too 

note this pizza suck even wors when it cold after take it home good pizza doesnt have that problem bleechdue forni had been on my radar for some time and i couldnt wait to tri it  as much as i thought i was go to love this place i have to say that i was sad mistaken

let start with the servic  our waitress was friend but probabl annoy onc she realiz we werent go to be spend the big buck like a lot of the other patron of this restaur  she tri so hard to upsel me to get a glass of wine that onc she discount the price i final cave  i got it more or less so that she would quit ask  other than that she was friend enough and attentive

mi husband and i had thought about go the one appet and one pizza rout to not be pig but when i saw that there werent ani vegetarian appet we decid to just get two pizza  we order the margherita roman style thin and crispi and the quattro formaggi neapolitan style chewi crust

our pizza came out quick and look realli good but after a few bite i wasnt veri impress  for starter im not sure if it the chees or if they add oliv oil but our pizza were drip in greas  the roman style was a littl too crispi for me and i love thin crust and the neapolitan was soggi in the middl  the flavor of the margherita were good but the quattro formaggi could have use a littl less chees and mayb some type of sauc to break up the flavor

despit think we were go to leav full and with leftov we end up eat it all and had room for more

whil the two oven is an interest concept there are other place id rather get a pizza that cost less and more import tast betteri came in here on a saturday around 2 pm and there was absolut no one in the place  i check out the menu for a solid ten minut befor a woman came out from the back  she didnt say anyth just went to her regist and stare at me  way to make a girl feel welcome

i order food to goa veggi wrap and some spici falafel sandwich with kale chip  she retreat to the back of the store and i fought the temptat to eat all of the cupcak in the platter on the counter to show my dissatisfact  but then i rememb that i am a grownup so i decid to walk away

twenti minut later she hand me my food no thank you or anyth but whatev  she tell me i can help myself to pickl and such on the bar  when i open the falafel sandwich it is clear that it is the wrong thing  when i ask her she just lie and say it is what i order  i was too hungri and annoy to argu so i said fine  

i walk over to the other food station becaus there was no hummus on the sandwich  she said oh we charg extra for hummus  ladi no one charg extra for hummus on a falafel  my peopl didnt wander through the desert schvitz and kvetch so that they could pay extra for hummus  hummus and falafel are like french fri and ketchup like oreo and milkthey just go together

with all that said if you are hungri enough that you dont care and you have your own person suppli of hummus go there between 112 for their lunch special  you get fri a drink and a falafel sandwich for 7   just dont expect ani hummus this place is a bit stuffi it nice and all but let me put it this way this place is veri age specif like most of scottsdal i suppos you will have a lot of peopl in their late forti and up here not that there anyth wrong with that

i like some of the foodespeci the tuna tartar but they do some sort of sushiamerican fusion roll that realli suck i complain becaus it is one of the most expens small plate on the menu and the number one thing the bartend recommend more on the bartend ahem  recommend later so this roll consist main of lobster and high qualiti beef but then they go and ruin it by smother the 2 indulg ingredi in a sauc that overwhelm the entir plate and the sushi rice is gross and kind of meali 

that roll piss me off it need edit but i guess it remind me of some of the unedit clientel i see at eddi vs as well like the bleach platinum blond girl with a hair piec fake eyelash dark navi eye shadow oompa loompa tan inject lip cake on makeup fake boob fake claw wear a skin tight design tshirt along with a thousand dollar handbag and 400  jean to coordin with her stripper shoe and abund accessor sterl silver tiffani jewelri that sat by me last visit i mean each element of her style probabl work on it own but all togeth it look like a vogu magazin threw up on her that sort of what the roll was for me btw she order the same thing the roll and like it so what that tell you

now for my big gripe i can describ the type of wine i like quit well i will ask for someth that tast a certain way and immedi everi bartend no matter what descript i give will direct me to the 2 most expens wine by the glass around 25 a glass on the menu price doe not equal qualiti and i find it offens when i tast the 25 glass of  wine and it in no way mirror what i was ask for i feel like they are just tri to upsel me without consid my tast i get it i work in sale too but i think it more import to give the custom what they want rather than tri to push them into spend more money also if i dont choos the most expens wine they kind of shrug their shoulder as if impli that all the other wine on the menu suck im of the think that noth on the menu should suck or not be worth suggest in one way or anoth so for that they get 2 star i have a feel it the staff more than the menu that is the problema beauti interior make one forget that this is locat in a strip mall but while the decor was beauti the lack of servic offset naga appear i walk in saturday night intend to order carryout and i dont mind a littl wait but when peopl alreadi seat said theyv been wait 45 minut plus for their food and at the 9 min mark nobodi even paid attent to me to take my order much less acknowledg i exist i left 

yeah this review may get flag as i didnt eat their food but when i walk in the door i expect to be acknowledg it not like you cant see me im not a small guy and at 6 ft 4 i block the sunlight pretti well when come through the door when the servic is so slow that they miss custom come and go theyv got problem the food may be as good as everyon claim but if the servic suck or is non existentwhi bother 

when i left i call penn thai hous from the park lot i made the drive down the 515 and my food was readi in under a 90 second wait and it was just as good as ever which mean it was perfect meanwhil i bet peopl were still wait for their food at naga 

i hope to tri naga again and mayb just mayb this time theyll notic me show me to a seat and take my order or polit ask me to wait and do so in under 10 minutthis was actual not good at all but thai food is thai food so im bump it a star 

i was realli sick and want to eat some major spici food to clear out my sinus i order my drunken noodl a 4 out of 4 and drove to pick it up when i took a bite it was probabl a 0 spice level it not onli had no heat it had no flavor realli at all plus the noodl were in these massiv clump the portion was small but it was onli a 7 lunch special 

thai spice is alway a gambl but i was serious need the spice this particular day and naga couldnt deliv i dont think i will wast my time tri it againthis use to be good for me 6 year ago but there are now quit a few competitor for the pizza king crown  all of them have left this place in the dust  we alway get a well done pie with extra chees and basil  the sauc tast veri water down and that pretti much kill the pie for me  it also irk me big time to sit right next to the huge pictur of yanke stadium ha  

the servic was abov averag and they did offer a bottl of red for half price so it was onli a whop 10  that was a nice surpris  the pizza might tast better if you had 2 bottl  

i notic a lot of custom go for the calzon and i will consid give that a tri the next time  it not like it was aw pizza but so mani place have rais the bar in town so much that this wouldnt even be my fourth choic  i know ill be back here at some point sinc my wife still love it but i am keep my finger cross hope this was just an off nightbefor leav the sun coast on a hike on the angel park trail my brother and i decid on someth to fill us over becaus the sun coast is in want of a fast food restaur we decid on the bagel corner cafe

 the bagel corner cafe is tuck in the southwest corner of the south coast near the sport book it is a cozi corner with a nice interior and suffici seats

 as far as the coffe and bagel color me unsatisfi the coffe was folger and the way it tast it was undrink this is someth that manag ought to fix becaus a few feet away is java vega serv starbuck coffe that is in realiti not much more  than bagel corner cafe the bagel with cream chees that came in a small tub to spread was one of the worst bagel that i have had in a veri long time that includ starbuck bagel the bagel was slight hard and lack tast 

  friend employe took my order they welcom me immedi ask for my name and in a few minut they page daniel 

 i rate bagel corner cafe two star i was unsatisfi with the gross coffe and slight hard bagel if it wasnt for the servic id given them one starive been to kitchen 56 for a coupl of happi hour befor and the experi were probabl about 35 starworthi  the outdoor patio is cute the wine select is decent and the happi hour is better than the vig if you prefer wine over beer  this solidlydec streak was broken last night when seven of us show up and were told there was no room for us on the patio  fine we took a tabl in the dine room  a manag stop by to apolog for not be abl to accomod our desir to sit outdoor  we forgav her

our waiter was sur tell us he was the one who was forc to help us  i get that it was a wri joke mayb but there was zero humor behind it and he seem more genuin than not  he then inform us that we did not qualifi for happi hour becaus we were not seat at the bar or on the patio  he was so unapologet that i thought he was joke  we ask if we could have the special anyway as we were there specif for happi hour and had intend to sit outsid if the few tabl had not alreadi been taken  he disappear to ask and return with a solid no  we decid that this would not stand and walk out as multipl member of the waitstaff and the manag watch expressionless  guess they had alreadi made too much money that day and didnt have ani more room for ours

th dine room was empti by the way  wtf mate  seven of us could easili have rack that tab up to 200 in drink alon if onli they had let us partak of their flimsi happi hour deal which do not includ food special for the one hour that was remain of the special  real nice kitchen 56  real nice

they realli deserv one star for that as my previous experi werent exact shine exampl of servic but unlik the staff at kitchen 56 i am feel a littl generous todayi want to love this place i reeeeealli realli do my boyfriend live in the optima so when i saw this littl cafe open up with it littl patio by the fountain i had vision of warm even with a glass of wine  appet or grab a late night latt or cup of gelato they even have a small market with a littl produc some person productseven pet suppli 

on paper this place sound awesome

howev divin continu to disappoint me my boyfriend  our friendseven though we all continu to give them chanc after chanc after chanc sad face

i have work in differ restaur for over five year i understand a littl of what it take to make an establish work custom servic is huge it is obvious to me that this place has no real manag  bare ani train for ani of their staff the servic is so terribl no one seem to know what they are do the employe are usual friend but total utter clueless actual had to grab a bag of cat food this morningappar 18 for a small bag of food accord to the cashier when we reconsid obvious she said ohhhh wait wellhow bout 650  what this is not the first time price have been negoti for someth from their market

i have wait for a turkey sandwich for over half an hour we wait for a pizza for an hour while a man who i assum mayb was the owner came out to apolog a few time that was all he did he seem total frazzl  out of it they had three other tabl in the restaur at that time  come on 

most of the time they seem to be out of at least half of what is on their menu im 99 sure their soup is can campbel their hour varyi think depend on when or mayb if someon decid to show up we went by  thought they had final close up for goodbut the next night it was open with someon play live music so confusing

i keep go back becaus their food isnt bad onc you get it  they have an awesom select of tea  a pretti nice wine list  it is just so gosh darn convenient

i hate to be so negat about a place that has sooo much potenti but serious they need to get their shit togeth i think their concept is a great idea but divin is just fall so far shortumami and i got off on the wrong foot from the veri begin i live just a few door down from this place and have watch the restaur take shape from the time they bought their hous renov it and open their door the willi st neighborhood is a pretti friend communiti were use to live in a mixedus area of commerci and residenti build we are proud of our thrive local busi and strive to support them we have a long tradit of resid and busi work togeth on this street

but umami hasnt shown itself to be anyth approach a local citizen i have yet to meet the owner i receiv no forewarn or apolog for the endless construct traffic imped flow on willi street dure their renov process i receiv no invit to an open night no neighbor oliv branch as far as i know umami owner are outoftown unfamiliar with madison cultur and just look to make a buck as a few other have comment umami sign like it build is hidden and nondescript most patron dont find their park lot  mean that peopl who actual live on willi st and reli on street park are start to becom accustom to not be abl to find park in the evenings

but all this is local stuff right for most of you how umami treat it neighbor is small bean a month after umami open i decid to let go of my resent and give it a go 

friend from japan were visit from out of town so we thought this would be the perfect opportun contrari to what mani have said here i found the servic was the highlight of the experi if anyth this place is overstaf and the owner have obvious gone to great length to maintain asian appear 

mi first shock came when i walk in the door the exterior of the build fail complet to captur what the owner are appar go for i was hope for a homey and comfort noodl joint walk in i was blast with a decor scheme that scream chic new york asianfus the spars menu was a disappoint mix of the two i got the vegetarian dumpl and my companion order ramen both were shock unremark the high price and tryingveryhard decor tri to overshadow the menus bland leastcommondenomin approach to japanes food but the result felt out of touch with madison where the tast where the fun where the palat burst with unexpect flavor combin at the veri least where the care and delic ritual and present that make japanes food so famous the menu seem optim instead for eas and profitbld im do this for your own good my husband and i are huge fan of cork so when we heard you were open a new spot and that we are locat inbetween the two we were super excit unfortun we have been realli let down 

the first two time i visit i figur they were just still work thing out so was tri not to be too hard on them but the sandwich i order was pretti greasi and the second time we visit the waiter appar had noth els to do and check on us an annoy amount of time they seem to have way too mani staff there most who seem to be veri inexperienc and nervous which make for an uncomfort experi 

yesterday experi was unaccept we were sat at lunch and then sat and sat some more i kept tri to get the attent of anyon of the 5 server who were work in our section nobodi even look at us final we had to leav becaus nobodi came to our tabl after 15 minut and hubbi onli has an hour for lunch 

two star becaus i have hope we are go to let them work out the kink and tri again in a few monththis is a famili run busi that is clean and they truli care about custom servic last time i was in there i had a ninja chicken bowl which seem to be their specialti it consist of main rice with chunk of chicken and a lot of soy sauc they owner ask me how i like it and i said i didnt so at least they care enough about the custom but i just cant bring myself to come back there wasnt anoth custom dure the whole time i was at this place1st they tweet a special 2for1 sandwich special two from our group order and were then told the special was onli dure a specif time fine except that the tweet came after that time and it said come on in

2nd the ac uniti or someth came one everi time one of the server busboy manag etc came out through the doorand it stay on if the door is not close completelythey on mani of the occas left it just slight open so the loud unit stay on we had to close the door

3 i was charg extra for the extra small dish of marinara sauc no mention that there was a cost 

4 no special in fact even though there were 2 kid and 6 adult three of which were separ there was an automat gratuiti 17 
and they leav a spot for anoth gratuiti in case you dont catch it good thing someon in the group point that out

5 the garlic knot were ok

6 my server seem to not care about much sorri i didnt order a big meal but there was seem littl reason to do so

7 we meet onc a week on friday and are look for 4 specif place to hang on a regular basisusu there are 812 peopl that come outi am not sure i am vote for this place

8 whi a i do this you ask me to yelp it you said oh wait this isnt yelp ok then guess i will now copi and pasti realli want to like this place as i heard good and bad thing about it mayb last night they were have a rough time but ala here is my review

i met other yelper here for pretheat dinner i will say there were about 20 of us give or take at various tabl at the larger tabl of about 12 for some reason they just couldnt seem to get it togeth drink order got mix up food order came out veri late or not all yes you read that right not at all  it got to the point that we were scrambl to eat the food some of us did receiv and pay our bill to get out of there to catch the show the tabl across from us the entir parti came in later than we did  tabl of 6 and yet they were serv there drink food and check in a veri time fashion and yes they were part of our group

i will say this the food that we did receiv was good and the staff was friend enough but still it doe not make up for the servic the restaur was not busi and we had reserv so it was not like they didnt know we were come  which make this even more puzzl mayb i will tri again if and when i am downtown and just sit at the bar mayb it was the fact that we were a larg parti but again the restaur was not busi mayb they were just have an off nightalthough the food is good and i am all about support a local busi i just cant deal with the smoke and spotti servic even the dine area reek of smoke i had to take a shower after i got done eat there becaus the smell was just  too much also our waitress who i assum is also the owner at first was attent and then kinda forgot about us to go bs with the bar patron and watch the game boyfriend mom went without her ice tea refil for a veri long time serverown also took forev to bring over the check i could understand it if she was slam but not when i can see her stand at the bar watch the game i gave this place a chanc but left with a complet differ impress this time passwe went last night and when we got there found out they didnt have their liquor licens yet so we went and bought wine and brought it in which is fine actual probobl save money sinc we didnt have to buy there  then we wait  overal servic was slow walter the general manag was rude they were in the weed and need help even a bus boy would have help a ton and the food was just okay

to elabor if you want to know more  we probobl sat for 45 min befor be abl to order appat which was fine at first becaus i thought they were just give us time to mingl but as the night went on realiz they couldnt keep up  walter was our server general manag  i tri three differ time to strike a convers or get ani type of person or opinion out of him and he alway respond with short monoton answer like we were more of a pest then anyth   at that point i thought for how rude they are the food must be outstand  

the decor i couldnt figur out there are pictur of carla everywher but cloth hung up like on a cloth line not classi and side on the back wall so i thought we were mayb suppos to be in the backyard type atmopsher but the window had a curtain on it  i know the decor shouldnt matter all that much but by that time i was irriti and for the price you are pay didnt feel like the decor matched

then we final order our meal and my friend ask to have some sausag with his and the general manag said and i quot nope the chef will kill me  so we just order them on the side and mix them in but whatev i didn think it was a tough request

i order a pasta with shrimp which i was realli look forward to and it was just okay  way too much butter just swimim to the point that that was all you could tast  my husband ask about the penn vodka which is suppos to be one of her signatur i believ or if the spaghetti and meatbal were better and walter said spaghetti which i thought was odd

w sat forev to get our check and had mine and my husband food box up  when walter brought the food back he put it on the floor which i thought was weird as well  i have never put anyon leftov on the floor in a like cvs bag  

we never actual got the check we had to flag him down to get him to take our credit card  he ask about dessert but by that time we had been there 3 hour and 15 min and just want to leav  what was even more annoy was there were peopl wait to get a tabl and the restaur was small so all they would have had to do was be much mroe attent and we probobl would have onli been there 15 to 2 hour top  

overal i would never go back and beween us and the tabl next to us who we overheard dont think this place will last at all  i give it a coupl month unless they turn their servic aroundlike mani other i realli want local busi and most especi local restaur to succeed  unfortun bratalian is a long way from have the ingredi necessari for success 
we made a reserv for this past saturday night at 8 pm  when we arriv there was a crowd hover around the door wait to check in for reserv  the restaur was full and it was clear that there was a bit of a traffic jam in servic  the gentleman who was greet peopl and check them in for reserv was also do doubl duti as a waiter so i was not put off by a short wait to see him  he was howev suffici brusqu to the coupl in front of us that they simpli left 

after assur us sever time that our tabl was almost readi we were seat about twenti five minut after our reserv  we hd brought wine with us which was open prompt and we got bread and water relat quick  that was the high point  it was clear that the restaur staff was neither suffici numer nor experienc to meet the demand that they were under  our waiter said sever time to the neighbor tabl that there were still a number of kink to be work out  he wasnt kid 
for appet we order a capres salad and the fri calamari and zucchini  the capres was averag i would put it slight below that serv at settebello  the fri calamari and zucchini which was serv with a good dip sauc would turn out to be the high point of the meal  
we got our appet reason prompt and were enjoy our wine we had order our entre at the same time as the appet  two pasta dish the orrechiett with sausag and broccoli rabe and the lemon butter sauc capellini  with shrimp  we wait and wait and wait for two pretti straightforward pasta dish   our waiter apolog repeat but didnt seem to have ani control or ani abil to predict when we might get serv final after an hour gap between appet and entre our pasta final arriv sad it was not worth the wait 

the shrimp and lemon capellini one of the most expens pasta at 24 was essenti ined  first the capellini had not even been cook to reach the al dent stage which i would have thought was virtual imposs with such a thin delic pasta  instead it was still crunchi  more critic though was the complet lack of balanc in e dish  it was overwhelm by lemon to the point of the sauc bear a substanti resembl to limencello   the acid flavor was so pronounc as to make the dish imposs to eat   we left three quarter of it which our waiter a nice guy tri hard did not notic nor comment upon  

the orechiett was margin better  the sausag was tasti but again there was a lack of harmoni the bitter of the broccoli rabe which should have been a counterpoint domin the dish and again threw off what could have been an excel combin 

other have describ this as a good valu  i believ that that percept may be larg a function of the temporari byo situat  my salad was 12 and the pasta 24  i think that is compar to todd and not all that much cheaper than scarpetta again with liquor taken out of the equat  it is clear pricier than settebello even factor in liquor at settebello  ani of these three are substanti better on both the food and servic front 

while dine and dure the prolong wait we had lot of time to look around  the dine room and observ what is clear a bad sign for a new restaur  addit peopl come and leav put off by the scrum and lack of organ of the front of the hous  even a wors sign was the  lack of smile and content from fellow diner  those smile and enjoy are what a simpl delici italian restaur like this aspir to be should deliv and they were nowher in evid  although i will continu to root for the local option i could not recommend bratalian to fellow local at this juncturyour servic suck and is slow

b stuck go to einstein even though your bagel are betterquit frank one of the wors burger ive had  i order the signatur coal burger figur this would be the best exampl of what they had to offer  after a coupl bite i had to dous it with ketchup and mustard just to choke it down   burger are serv medium and are not cook to order  that said mine was well done   on top of this onli be open a week they are definit still work out the kink  for those of you french fri lover out there cool burger fri tast a lot like those at wendi in my opinion so not bad but noth id call special

two star for good shake nice atmospher friend staff and cool location

mi take is scottsdal quarter is a veri cool new scene with great peopl watch so definit a great locat to check out  just do so at one of the other numer restaur    five guy fan im not will find one across the street and numer place in this area will serv up a better burger than coal   for those of you abl to travel and die for a truli amaz burger zinburg in the biltmor fashion park about 25 min away is phenomen this is a review of their a la cart options

th skinni although we didnt partak of their ayc their a la cart item and bento were below par fyi  if you do not have their ayc the menu and price can be confus 25 servic mess up bill which my hubbi had to actual grab a menu and show the waitress that she was wrong 2 valu given the experi here i wouldnt come back2

i was enthus to see a high rate sushi place so i nag the hubbi to come tri this place out when we arriv we werent hungri enough to tri their ayc option instead we order their delux bento with a side salad and miso soup katsu curri and a side order of the grill pork belly

fyi  if you order a la cart the price are all on the actual foldout menu not what on the ayc sheet or the supplement page on the placemat make sure you check your bill becaus we were charg for the more expens price for pork belli ie supplement for the ayc add on instead of the a la cart price the waitress ask the chef instead of check the menu and didnt believ us my hubbi had to ask for the menu to show her the differ 

the delux bento suffer from mani problem but let just start off with the babi upchuck masquerad as some sort of misguid egg salad they put in the top right hand corner see pic httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosuseridh9ruaaha5kcqkqtjsgs0qselectpnoiiecckc0v8o2pwrgw or perhap the complet anem teriyaki chicken which didnt even have grill mark on them the fri salmon and tempura were both soggi we had to ask for tempura sauc sashimi  the fish was cut into thick chunk but isnt cut in the proper matter allow the fish to melt in your mouth for what it worth the california maki was okay 

there was littl to no katsu with the katsu curri  fyi  the cutlet in the photo repres about 40 of the entir cutlet which is rather small for 8 see pic httpwwwyelpcombizphotosjyxhvtjsyke7m9rbza7maselecttl0grsos4viwjapsgabvog  the curri itself was over thick and bland due to the addit of perhap too much potatoes

fin the grill pork belli while the textur of the pork belli was nice the flavour of the pork was over smoki for our tast the addit of the rather odd sour tast mango salsa was a deteri to the dish certain not someth we would order again and we found it expens for the price

overal given our experi with a la cart we probabl wont be stop by for ayc but certain check your bill if you do decid to do the a la cart tastim an ayc sushi king out here in las vega my palett deserv noth but the best i hate to sound snobbish becaus far from that when it come to food but i know my sushi and this review will reflect the entir experi i share with friend of mine

i heard about this place from a few friend alreadi and i want to give it a go becaus like i said i am the ayc sushi king i had to tri it to measur it up to my favorit in the valley after a marathon i left the decis of food to a good friend of mine and i had great expect becaus i believ in her tast now mind you it would all be our first time but i was down there such a thing call hungri eye and i dont mean patrick swayz in dirti danc and my eye were not satisfi let alon my royal palett  i start off by warm up my stomach with my usual order of nigiri fresh water eel salmon and cajun albacor seawe salad and green mussel the preliminari order had satisfactori flavor but i did notic that they put veri littl rice i like that part i notic that the friend i was with was not veri happi with their servic and that took a toll on my experi 

i believ a restaur must understand how to treat and serv their patron well first and then deliv with high qualiti food or product howev servic seem to be at the bottom of their prioriti at least for us it was

if my friend arent happi im not happi and when im not happi you get 2 star 1 for be open dure lunch and 2 for have an ayc sushi dure lunch for 2195 the sushi was subpar the appet were decent but not wow and the atmospher was not as welcom or friend as other in the valley they do have a cool sword in the men restroom though  i will probabl end up come here one more time becaus i love ayc sushi but im lean more toward avoid this place on to the next on on to the next onearguabl one of the best ayc sushi spot in clark counti locat south of the intersect of decatur and tropicana veri nice set and condens so that servic can be more closelyknit not 

this place had veri high expect and anticip from me not onli becaus of the amount of prais it generat but i is also the sister sushihous of sushi mon which is locat on silverado ranch blvd and maryland parkway howev base on what all my friend told me and all the yelp review it seem pretti decis that goyemon had an edg onli for me to say hell no

i came here on a quiet saturday afternoon with two friend who i pick up from the airport we began with the classic yellowtail and volcano roll i understand that volcano roll can take a littl while but realli 20 minut especi when there mayb like 34 occup in the restaur you would expect much quicker i mean dont get me wrong the qualiti of the roll was amaz but to take 20 minut is no justif im a hungri guy when im in an atmospher such as ayc im there to be in for the kill 

right after the volcano roll i ask for the ecstasi and philadelphia roll note everyth i order is half roll not full i like divers over quantiti this time it took somewher from 1015 minut come on these chef are profession and i understand that they can be under duress but im sure that this joint has been under far more pressur ever than by one singl person with that be just me how can it take near 40 minut to make 3 half roll i can run to the strip and back in that time ok not realli then i just order the sunris and sexi girl roll and after that i was way too frustrat with the incompet of the servic so conclud with my mochi and green tea ice cream and no it not becaus of the chef the tabl next to me which had one less person order roll later than me and receiv them befor me not to mention they are full roll not half if anyon can pleas give me a logic explan for the terribl servic i will be happi to give you my stamp card which is at 10 make my next visit free 

yet for a tab at 70 my friend and i end up pay 10 for servic obvious they feel the need to tip just becaus they feel bad but i dont feel bad feel bad is for all the hungri kid around the world their terribl servic may be explain that they like to stall me so that my stomach can process food faster and make me full quicker but that whi im here becaus im go to fight it if i have to they may have done this so that my stomach can process the food faster and to make me full quicker nevertheless a busi tactic that i dont appreci becaus they dont appreci my busi 

make no mistak this review is subject to chang becaus i do hope that they can make up for their stupid the food qualiti is the cream of the crop but if they choos to fail me next time in serv me i will pay the price and no tip then ill never return onli to keep my commit to goyemon sibl monso after hear so mani great thing from fellow yelper and see all the great review on yelp me and my fianc final tri it out and i was pretti disappoint 

so we get there and the ladi say it a 45 minut wait realli wow ok so they take our number and they call us about 45 minut later so they were true to their word mayb it wouldnt be a 45 minut wait if there were more then 12 tabl that just my thought 

so on to the delici sushi everyon brag about we both got ayc this is what i ordered

roy california 
mingus
taylor
sushi mon style lasagna 

they were all ok at best i do not like the tempura they use on the roll it super crispi and the textur is super weird which suck for me becaus i like tempura roll 
mi fianc on the other hand enjoy his sushi and said he would give it 4 star mind you he will eat anyth and think everyth tast fantast so his opinion doesnt count to me lol 

i realli expect better sushi the way everyon was talk this place up over all the food was ok at best the atmospher was uncomfort it felt like i was have dinner with complet stranger at my tabl becaus that how close and jam they have the tabl set up and i definit think 45 minut is to long to wait for ani place let alon a mediocr sushi joint like this 

this place is waaaaayyyi over ratethis placejust wasnt for me  

the compani i work for took us on a miniretreat to scottsdal for a weekend and a crew of us made our way over to el hefe  andit was justhow do i put this nicely

just not the midwest  all the women with fake tan fake boob spill out of tank faux sexi hipster mix men wear tight ed hardi with over gell hair  possibl steriod use  just not my thing

and it wasnt just the crowd of peopl there  i order two gin  tonic same gin and they tast vast differ  on top of that there were the over sur cocktail who seem to be piss off that peopl were there drink  

i mean i get that you want to finish your sidework and get home but when a bar is open and it not even midnight you cant get piss off at your custom for put down a drink on a tabl in an open section

mi favorit part of the night  leav  sorri bossi realli hate give honest review on new mom and pop type place but at the same time it is import to pass along the messag the way you feel it doe not mess with the integr of yelp hopefuli mayb will caus the busi to improv the food 
with that said i have know about this place for about a month now sinc i get flyer on my apart door and mailer i also drive by it all the the time where it is locat next to a quizno that has open and close twice so not a good sign on proper locat so i look at the menu and it is a fusion restaur of italian and chines kinda remind of the joke restaur of mexicanirish in the movi best friend girl mmm not a great idea but i want to tri becaus the price were extrem cheap

so i came in to the restaur and it was empti and i was not even sure if it was open until i look in the window and saw peopl cook 
everyth on the menu is realli cheap and noth more than 6 the counter peopl were nice but obvious still figur out their job
so here is what i ordered
1szechuan angel 5 angel hair pasta with peanut sauc and chicken that came with pesto bread and salad oh mani should have known better angel hair with peanut sauc not a good idea and it lack a lot of flavor some weird textur with the chicken i did not touch the salad caus i got so much food the bread was burnt and super cold i took a coupl bite and pass the whole pasta meal was thrown away within 5 bite 
2 general tsao chicken wing 3 you get 6 of them well these were a littl better but not much i ate 3 of the 6  the sauc was bit differ than i have had befor and it had strang flavor that i think came from the actual chicken wing that i think might be from the oil that had a gasolin type flavorit is was veri small but not good

3 pepperoni sausag egg roll 1 this was someth that was a lot better except it was super cold and i had to warm up at home  i dont think think this place has anyway of keep thing warm when they make thing one at time  but anyth in a egg roll wrap would be good but this was pretti decent and a good price

4 firecrack egg roll 1 probabl my favorit item here and the funni thing i think this is more mexi chines fusion than anyth it is an egg roll with grill chicken jalapeno and chees this is veri good and i should of got 12 of these and the price is veri good

5 the last thing i order was the egg roll canoli 1 this was also veri good just a basic canoli cream with chocol chip pipe into a form egg roll shell i realli like this and also a great price

overal i paid 1297 with tax so pretti cheap for that much food except i threw away more than half  i would come back for the egg roll and desert and i think they are on the money with those they just might need to get a heat lamp
th fusion pasta need to go and mayb they should focus on chines and have proper noodl to match the dish obvious vega is flood with chines restaur but this part of town is not i will probabl tri them again just caus the price are so good and the fri stuff is strong but i will stay away from the pasta dish for surei had hope for the best when i saw that sakura was be built  the asian cuisin avail for lunch near work is mighti scarc in north las vega so have a new option got me excit  sakura is a fast food style teriyaki restaur similar to samurai sam or teriyaki mad  you can order a combo meal which includ rice and veggi or you can go for a bento box that add in some california roll piec gyoza and salad which odd came with ranch

dur my first visit i order a bento and decid that it was not worth the ad cost to upgrad from a regular combo  the california roll seem to have sat out for a while and the salad with ranch dress didnt fit the meal  on my recent visit i got the regular teriyaki chicken combo which come with veggi and rice  i substitut brown rice  the chicken here is not the best qualiti and veggi are forgettable

outsid of the food one thing that odd is the way order are serv  the food is cook as it get order and the cook place the order on the counter in front of them  for some reason they yell out the name of the dish instead of the order number that we are given at the regist  have three peopl stare each other down for first dib on the anonym chicken teriyaki combo is odd and shouldnt be a problem in the first place sinc our receipt have numbers

th other thing that was odd is the price  look at the menu behind the regist the teriyaki chicken cost 569  ad brown rice cost 050  yet my receipt show that the combo onli cost 499 httpwwwyelpcombizphotosm27gwyt2epccjdsnxdjwaselectiue48zjr84hrno8ydujha

overal the experi dure my second visit feel like the first visit where i went the week they first open  thing should be a bit more organ by now and the price differ on my receipt versus the menu had me wonder how much everyth realli was  i dont think sakura stand up to their competit foodwis but it doe seem to be the cheaper alternan interest concept that didnt end up be what i hope for  

i was pretti excit to tri the posh noodl  nosh japanes street food as prepar by josh hebert  i love japanes food and was look forward to the dish that are not readili avail in phoenix  unfortun i was underwhelm by both the venu and the food

th locat insid the lexington hotel has definit seen better day  an attempt has been made to creat a temporari generic space with chalkboard wall and butcher paper top tabl  howev it came across as worn and dingy

our waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offer i didnt work here last night but was friend and did find out answer from other staff  foolish think that we would love each and everi dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day we tri a larg assort  an expens mistake

duck gyoza w ponzu  i prefer steam gyoza over the fri present here  also these had the tiniest greasi portion of fill i have ever seen

homemad tofu w ginger scallion cherri blossom  this was good with a sweet dessertlik flavor but a somewhat runni texture

okonomiyaki  this japanes pizza was among the better item  howev the textur of the ingredi was strang  ie full slice of bacon rather than smaller bites piec made greasier than it need to be and messi to eat

tako yaki  again a strang textur with awkward larg chunk of octopus surround by bread that fell apart easily

th ramen dish miso ramen w pork goma ramen w pork and shitak mushroom rame were small and more or less indistinguish from one anoth   we left most of them behind decid not to take anyth with us

th dessert green tea pot de crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overal about the 100 mealyou do realiz that this isnt the pool at mandalay and you realiz on monday you will have to go back to the cash regist and us magazin and realli you thought it would be a good idea to get a tattoo of your dog on your shouldernext to the tribal swirl 

all question i didnt ask but did wonder while at spanish fli 

if you want to hang out at or near a pool with scottsdal finest well this is the place it is present exhibit a 

of cours at night stay out of that pool no i am serious they will physic take you out if need be but dure the day you and dog tattoo boy can hang out in the water all day 

the servic is friend well minus the typic scottsdal door peopl who general fail as alway to rememb that they are not work the new hot club in la or nyc come on peopl south park make fun of scottsdal 

odd at night becaus of the pool i presum you need to sign a waiveri will leav it asid as to whether that waiver would ever hold up in court 

the drink run the norm but ive never had the food howev i did see someon carri out sushi roll to a tabl in the 100 degre heatummm no thank the djsehhh the usual but better than drift 

if you want to see 20 someth in bikini a few cougar on the prowl high rise basebal hat short and high top and realli bad tattoosplus catch some water and sun this is a good spot 

it is worth a 30 minut show if there is no cover but it is hard to swallow as an afternoon hang out and i would never pay to get inwow major disappointment

w use the free hous wine offer and gave it to my mom

i order the crispi deep fri and sticki cover in mozz chees ball i guess they are tri to make the old ladi blush when they read the menu in diablo hot 10 for two i also order a caesar salad 

mi guy ask the owner who was our waiter and park his lambo on the sidewalk in front of the place what dish is their best especi for first comer his answer chicken parm realli chicken parm he got the marsala

w order calamari for an appet it was not crispi it was flavorless serious need salt and pepper

mi beef ball came haha they are suppos to be gourmet the extra money you spend to have them crispi and sticki go to wast there was no textur to these meat ball they were pure mush the sauc was pretti good though and spicy

when the marsala was deliv i knew that the veggi on the side were either frozen or out of a can the carrot were the circl with the crinkl pattern on them and the broccoli was just the stem not the fluffi top the marsala sauc was over sweet

overal meh no thankive been here a few time not by my choic and this place is mediocr at best so i have no idea whi so mani peopl are give them rave review let me go through my phoanalysis

pho
th broth is noth to write home about it not terribl nor bland but it certain not memor the meat noodl and veg were fresh

spr rolls
dec but onc again not amaz there werent ani mint in the roll i had and the peanut sauc is disappoint 

where the restaur lost huge point with me was the inflat overpr menu the small bowl of pho are 78 and 89 for larg depend on which one you order the bahn mis were 56 are you kid me and 5 for two spring roll it defeat the whole purpos of eat pho which is suppos to be cheap and conveni saigon kitchen has more of a modern loung feel to it and that not what i want in vietnames food focus on the food not the decor

som bonus point for the bar they have varieti of beer on draft sapporo kilt lifter blue moon coor light and some type of pale ale i couldnt make out there a small select of liquor avail also

overal im not a fan of sk but my friend who live nearbi drag me there onc in a while id much rather make the trip to central king eggrol who has the best pho in the valley so far from my experiupdat review just went here on a busi friday and becam not a fan

i did order my norm combo plate  pork cube pork chop and shrimp  note i alway ask to replac the shrimp with chicken  i cannot eat shellfish and i assum chicken is less than shrimp  to my surpris they want to up charg for the swap  the waiter said he would have to talk to the manag to do the swap with no up charg  
i also note the manag talk up charg to anoth custom that want to substitut the noodl for anoth type of noodl  
to top of the experi anoth group of custom ask for a bus boy to clean their tabl  after wait for a good 10 minut they left  
mayb they were have a bad night of servic  anoth issu i had was onc i did get my main cours i was not given a steak knife to cut the pork chop on the plate  onc i did flag down someon i was told that they had to grab a knife from the kitchen and had no steak knife and the normal knife cannot cut the pork chop
i have put saigon kitchen on the bottom of place i would visit now that i have experienc poor servic on this visit  not onli me but it was note around me and it is not often i am at a restaur and custom leav becaus of lack of attent  
fix the custom servic up charg and get some knife to cut what you serv  wish the owner were there  i alway experi great custom servic when they are present i use to love this placeok there were a few thing i did realli like such as the locat duck crap or no i like the park here as long as it isnt too hot and the pond dont give off the love aroma of decay but man the tree are fantast  even if they occasion snag my fish line on cast 

i would realli like this to turn into someth special it is close to where im at and we all thrive on convenience

but there alway a but this particular market seem fair lack in fresh produc i saw two setup that handl fruit and veggi and i notic the larger one had box from other locat in california and all the littl sticker that store are suppos to attach to each piec of fruit that tell you what countri it origin from were all stick on the empti box and not on the fruit mislead at best

th coffe guy had averag select the lemonad stand was okay not much call for the sew ladi good the honey ladi was price at 24 a jar and if youv read my other review drive to miquel would be cost effect if you are pick up a coupl of jar and better for you sinc the pollen would be from local plant and not those from further away 

id say a nice excus to get into the park and walk around watch the park though tight and there lot of backer upper who dont bother look but walk around even under the shade of tree realli make me question whi anyon is here in vega in august and walk around includ me

but i realli realli hope they get some vendor with more info on what they are sell a guy stick a flat of cherri at me and cant answer anyth in english doesnt fill me with trust i want info not just the thought it might come from a small farm i want proofas bad as i want to tri new indian restaur in town i alway end up leav utter disappoint and regret my decis for not just go to mint my neverfailsm stapl  taj palac was no exception

th had start off well with a nice interior and friend servic  but then everyth start to go downhil from there with a total blowup to end our meal

food took much too long to come out
fre papadum were nice but the tamarind and mint chutney tast old
th garlic naan had no traceabl amount of garlic plus it was super crunchi and almost burnt
5 for a bowl of plain rice
th aloo gobi or gobi aloo as they call it was complet flavorless at an indian restaur  it was just boil potato cauliflow and tomato sit in some liquid  not edible

i will give credit where credit is due and say that the paneer tiki masala was veri good  it was flavor and had a generous portion of paneer

th kicker was at the end when we went to pay for our meal and we were told they wouldnt accept our coupon  it would have been one thing if there was a sign post on the door state this or if we hadnt shown the server the coupon until the end of our meal  howev there is no sign say they dont accept coupon and we had the coupon out at the edg of the tabl from the minut we sat down  four server never onc said anyth about it befor we order despit the fact that i saw all of them look at it

im tire of restaur offer coupon and then decid they dont feel like it anymor and wont make good on the one that are still out there  but to wait until after we are done eat to tell us when you know that we have a coupon wait is shadi to me  

it time like these i wish my mom didnt rais me to be polit and just walk away from the situat  

the paneer was their save grace that brought them up to two staris this place actual suppos to be     you know    a business

w show up at about 7 on a tuesday put us in the noman land between happi hour that part didnt matter much to me but as we seat ourselv i wonder if we might be catch them in a dead spot mayb that explain the rest of the review im not anxious to tri again at ani time

w chose to sit in the bar area where more of the tabl were full than in the restaur area we were just there for a coupl drink and some app  the waitress show up and my friend ask what they have on tap the waitress recit a volumin list from memori bland howev neither of us could hear her well enough over the brian adam or some other drone shit they had play too loud in the background my friend ask to see a print beer list the waitressa bit perplexedexplain that they dont have print beer list my friend settl for water and start search zipp phoenix beer on her iphon on the other hand  idetermin to get my drink onord up a vodka tonic and throw in an order of some wings

w wait

i get my drink the tonic water is flat as a stretch of nebraska interst waitress come back around i tell her that it not work for me and sinc i suspect that their tonic has gone flat i order a vodka diet coke instead she apolog and take the drink away a few minut later shes back with the diet coke and vodka 

which is also flat 

and appar made with vodka made from strain sterno through gym sock 

waitress is now off in the distanc cart around dish i tri to wave her down no respons i take it to the bar bartend not pay attent i look back to our tabl the waitress is back but emptyhand my friend is now search various blog entri from 2007 look for hint of which beer they offer besid    yknow    fuckin bud light which might be all they usual sell

i decid to have a beer instead take the time to walk back to the bar to look at the tap i order an ipa  my friend say oh that sound     ok     ok then two make it two ipa the waitress slowli walk off cart with her the last abort attempt at a cocktail and our inspir beer order

w wait 

i look over at the kitchen and was remind of an order for some wing place way back    oh   a coupl of screwedup drink order befor seem like sometim back dure the day of weimar republ by this point  i notic that although the bar area is welloccupi the restaur area is basic empti i dont see ani order up on the kitchen window server and the cook are stand around talk i look at my friend across the tabl we look at the bar and back at the kitchen no beer no wing the tast of two lousi drink still on my tongu a graduallyaccumul wave of bitter resent rise within me

w got up and left the garag was right across the street and was everyth that zipp wasnt this night

in a word a busi25 stars

food was okaynoth memorable

w dure happi hour and had the alfredo flat bread angri shrimp mushroom and kobe beef slider flat bread was realli oili on top and has a sour aftertast eek i order the slider medium and they were veri dri mayb i should get medium rare next time also the beef didnt have that kobe qualiti or tast but they quantiti of meat was so minim who know the mushroom were good but super butteri and two mushroom for 6 buck happi hour price it didnt seem worth it good thing we went dure happi hour menu seem a littl pricey for such mediocr food servic was slow but friend 

it too bad realli i was excit to tri this place overal food and vibe is a littl pretenti check out their websit and youll catch my drift will come back to give their breakfast and sandwich a chancsorri black chile i just wasnt a fan

jar and i felt like tri someth new one night last week and after read about how great black chile burger was from our friend at eateraz we thought wed give this place a shot

th restaur itself is spacious the hostess and servic attent and friend and the decor is tast  but unfortun the food was noth special and i wont be rush back

w start with chip and salsa  i think they bring these to everyon  these werent bad  for our meal jare went with the burger and i went for the fish taco per our waitresss recommend and a side of corn  i like the sticki rice and bean it came with but the rest of the meal was underwhelm  jare didnt love his either

sinc my visit i learn that this concept come from restaurateur michael mcdermott and jason merritt who have been involv with the develop of numer restaur includ the fame kona grill i thought it felt a littl chaini  that explain it 

im pregnant so i didnt have a corona or margarita which may have made my meal tast better but regardless ive experienc much better mexican food befor and with so mani other mexican concept to choos from in the valley i probabl wont be rush back lo siento again black chilethe burger and fri here are not too shabbi on my last visit here i order 3 meal all the same doubl cheesseburg wfri  drink there were ton of employe work when i was there like too mani there were 4 peopl at the counter  it was not busyabout 2pm on a monday  and there were sooooo mani peopl in the kitchen area that i could not count  mayb like 10  and then there were ton in the dine area  some were eat and other were clean  anyway when we got our food all of the burger were made veri sloppi and one of the burger was miss the other burger patti when i went to the front it took forev to be acknowledg by someon they were all run around like they were lost i made eye contact with the manag sever time while wait and she said nada final got it taken care ofwhen the girl brought the new burger it was not a new one they just ad the patti to the burger with 2 bite taken out of it and the girl said if anyth els is wrong let us know in a not veri friend tone

not this place did open not too long ago and this may be the reason for so mani employe be there like mayb there was some train go on howev after observ the manag while eat i notic that she did not have a grip on handl the chao and it made for an unpleas dine experi i may tri go back in a few month to see if thing have improvthe bf and i are rare in the area and i had to make sure we tri to hit up point of interest with this place at the top of the list 

we got some butter cooki and snickerdoodl which were pretti good but standard as far as cooki go

w also got half a dozen cake truffl and these were pretti to look at with cute flower and leav on them but that was about it the ice was thick too sweet and fell off the cake when you bite i took off the ice entir off the piec i got and some cake are too sticki and wet i left 3 untouch and put it to the trash now i see shari s review and i wish i saw it earlier and avoid these all togeth or wish i onli got one and tri someth else

im not understand the hype or i order thing that were averag and then  their worst dessert they should mayb reformul the recip of or scratch it out all togeth 

so far first impress was realli disappointi like the town squar locat the one or two time i was there but the food i got at the tivoli locat was mediocr at best the sweet potato and chicken risotto 1625 was gummi and tast like past the fettuccin napoli 1595 was better but noth stellar the best thing i tri was the kid chees pizza yeah that mean the place is kid friend the price are reason  although from what i hear happi hour is the best time to go sinc app are 3 eachfinal tri haulin ball at vega streat recent  i was unfulfil from the special at slider truck so i figur id tri someth ive never had befor  the guy work the window was friend and he convinc me to tri the tuna ball  he said id love em  well i didnt  they were ok but i was hope for someth a littl rarer than the deep friend tuna i end up with  even wors it was 10  seem a littl pricey for what a snack at best  if it was half the price thatd make much more sense

a friend of mine tri the same thing at a differ event and was onli charg 9  what up with thatpile high pleas dont insult me especi at 9sandwich a la cart it insult realli if by pile high they mean bullshit then i guess it not too far from the truth valuewis it is horribl in nyc or chicago a deli like this wouldnt last a week perri deli in chicago has far larger sandwich that are actual cheaper than stazli in madison there someth terribl wrong with that the side salad was okay but the serv was skimpi if your go to use a contain for a side of macaroni salad at least fill the damn thing rather it look like one scoop of macaroni with lot of space around it perhap to underscor the lack of valu unfortun i dont think this deli is go to chang price includ a side or add more meat to their sandwich mayb if for a dollar extra you can get a side of soup or potato pancak or for 50 extra a scoop of slaw or potato salad that might make sens sinc peopl are so desper for someth decent in this neighborhood i fear that the local herd of sheep will continu to support this busi despit the ridicul price i mean for 9 i can go buy my own corn beef rye bread and side salad from a groceri store deli and probabl have a decent chunk of chang left over it anoth disappoint on the east side as i am still in search of qualiti and valu 

as for the sandwich fatti and not in the pile high sens for everi 12 of meat on the slice there was near an equal amount of fat the bread and the sandwich did tast good the macaroni salad was pedestrian and certain not worth the a la cart price the sandwich is also construct to look thicker than it realli is with the meat kind of wad up in the middl for present sake then thin out to about a slice or so id say a 13 of the way from the center the wad of meat in the middl give the appear of thick as your most chew on bread after a few bite at deli that pride themselv on the true mean of pile high the thick in the deadcent of a stazli sandwich is actual the thick throughout the sandwich at the kind of legendari delicatessen that theyr tri to be servic was friend and decent howev if this place feel justifi in lie pile high and charg ridicul price i have no intent to return ani time soon

in close i realli do want to like this place i just dont want to pay 9 for a sandwich that leav me hungri if stalzi want to be on the level of a perri or manni everyon should be leav with half a sandwich left to eat later as 12 is enough if they dont plan on truli pile the meat on then mayb a price cut is in order make thing in hous should mean better price be in madison on the east side should mean lower price but for some reason valu continu to be elusi did some wonder around after have some gelato from art of flavor and notic viva las arepa right next door it was spacious but there werent a lot of peopl insid the menu seem like there was a lot of go on dont know when ill be back again and had to get it right so i had to reli on the yelp app to see what everyon was get 

the reina pepiada was mention pretti frequent  i wasnt sure if it was someth i should eat or someon i should meet it was an arepa fill with a mixtur of chicken breast avocado mayo and cilantro it wasnt that big and didnt tast that amaz on it own it was too much avocado and mayo and not enough chicken for me but it was onli about 5 and it was enjoy after dump whatev sauc were insid of the red and yellow contain  

they did lack custom servic i explain that this was my first time here and if they had ani recommend or custom favorit they could not help me with that and seem rude about it even went back to whatev they were do befor i ask for a menu sat in the corner and brought out the yelp app i didnt feel as welcom as art of flavor felt like i should go back there custom servic is big for me it not that hard to be friend courteous and give your attent to pay customers

th rest of their food do sound and look good from the review and pictur post and im sure theyr well deserv of the 2 star i gave them but sinc the food from what i had was just ok and the servic wasnt to my like there is no way i can give them a 3 star ok to someth i was not ok with anoth visit will happen but not anytim soonive never had an arepa befor but heard lot of good thing about this place so we had to tri it
aft scan review and the menu we settl on the garlic shrimp hot wood fire beef and a coupl of tequeno fri chees sticks
i feel the food was pricey for the quantiti i like the chees stick but doug thought they tast too sweet the garlic shrimp was ok like shrimp scampi on a maiz bun the shrimp was a littl mushi and after a few bite was over it the beef was ok too just not a lot of flavor even with the sauc i guess we just dont get the appeal the servic was good but
i would not go back i rather save room for gelatoit a shame but after each visit ive becom less and less impress my first visit was phenomen and my second visit was still pretti great as evidenc in my previous review the woodfir beef was a bit dri dure my third visit but i brush it asid attribut it to a fluke or bad time howev my last visit has solidifi my disappoint and necess to write an updat review

sinc ive had five of their arepa option i decid it was time for anoth one so i chose the vegetarian avocado black bean tomato pepper onion for 5 i was confus at first becaus all i saw were black bean with a littl bit of avocado bare surfac refer photo mayb they got my order wrong i search for veget through the bean with no success it wasnt until i took a few bite that i final locat a veri sad tomato piec i figur that was just how they made the vegetarian arepa the bean were nice season but their overwhelm quantiti made it incred difficult to eat in an arepa the arepa itself was delici as alway i was alreadi disappoint by my select becaus of the lack of veget then i saw photo of what the vegetarian arepa should look like or have look like and now im upset it cost the same as or more than their meat option and they cant includ a heap of veget not cool

also after four visit it doesnt seem like a coincid that my tabl is consist ignor no one ever check on us it usual me and ruben while they seem more than happi to visit and chat with sever other custom it has made us feel unwelcom im realli sad to say this but i will be get my arepa elsewher from now oni realli dont know whi i see so mani 5 star review where are peopl tast bud i think it becaus it the most decent greek you can find in henderson i got sucker into the hype but i have had way better 

i call in an order for pickup the guy put me on hold but i hung up after hear him chat the whole time with anoth custom about irrelev stuff second time i call the guy took my order and i like how fast he turn around my order said it would be readi in 15 minut 

the restaur is a bit small but it realli cute it has an outdoor seat area with shade and a water fountain the insid look veri clean and organ i order two gyro sandwich and a combo which come drink and fri the guy that took my order was a lot nicer in person and veri cute i must say when i got home i chow down and it was satisfi but not out of this world the amount of meat was good how gyro should be but it was not that marin it was bland the tzatziki sauc did not tast much like cucumb or the fresh dill it describ as but it had a lot of feta which made it tast better the fri were ok

i want to give the greek bowl a chanc place is conveni for hendersonian but i rather drive and use my gas tank to las vega and go to the fat greek on the corner of flamingo and decatur my review is from 2011 check it out but my thought have not chang mayb i held my standard high for this place in comparison but ill updat this review if my mind changvegetarian burrito and grill vegetarian burrito are both made with anim lard in the bean  one employe shrug her shoulder anoth said that the way it is and a third said id just have to order it without the lard bean  whi make this naiv restaur mistak  dont call it a vegetarian burrito if it isnt vegetarian  just call it a veggi burrito   it especi annoy becaus vegetarian tend to gravit toward more gringo place like this one that are more like to have vegetarian item than the more tradit mexican place where lard and chicken stock is put in everything

gril veggi burrito had cold chees insid  not melt not lukewarm but cold  tortilla wasnt the slightest bit warm either just as if it was serv raw  so there this cool to the touch tortilla with cold chees insid and then the grill veggi  

tabl receiv salsa which is nice the hot is realli more of a medium but then a small portion of chip  the onetop next to me had the same chip portion and we had 3 in our parti  whi do this to peopl  your go to hear a request for more chip within the first few minut and peopl are go to wonder whi the tabl onli had one littl portion in the first place

atmospher is clean with huge mirror on some of the wall and a flat panel tv on the other show a natur documentari  a few fake macaw hang from the ceil  it still has a trace of the pick up stix feel that use to be here but went out of busi  order procedur is the same

staff was entir unlik most mexican place  vast major of peopl were caucasian or gringo if you prefer and that rais an eyebrow in an ethnic restaur  mayb that matter to the reader here mayb not

on a posit note the employe did check on tabl as folk were dine and were over the top with polit   that incred rare these daythis review is for coffe and the pastri 

i came in with amelinda l and teresa s last week after we had just grab dinner at view wine bar after walk in we were inform by one of the staff member that some of the pastri were 12 off great as we took a closer look at the cake and tart at the counter we were appal to see a lot of notsohot look littl guy there were talk smudg frost and fruit that had been sit out too long ie strawberri that were shrivel and brown plus a dri kiwi oh wait no it just a kiwi slice that has seen better days

when look at the pastri we ask a coupl questions

us what is this pastri here 
guy uhthi is the caramel and this is the strawberri and im not sure run off to ask a coworker
girl who swoop in that a caramel this is the strawberri chocol and that the chocol it my favorite

i love nondescript answer thank for the enlighten like i couldnt figur it out by the caramel drizzl the strawberri sit atop the second choic and the chocol garnish on the third 

worst of all the convers when order went like this

m id like two nutella cappuccino and the pumpkin latt  all medium size please
th same guy as earlier um what size do you want the latte
m a medium 
guy ok
m id also like the strawberri chocol cake and the carrot cake
guy ok
m how much are those
guy run off to check and at this time the girl in the front proceed to tell me again that some of the pastri were 12 off

terr hot mess express when i point out that some of the tart were sever dri out to the girl she said no those are fine what a lie serious is this amateur hour the two star are for the baristawho seem to actual have a clue sinc our drink were total on par the rest of it though no thank youi went to this locat for a work lunch the restaur was abl to accommod our larg group of 40 peopl the wait staff would have to be the highlight of the experi the lay out was great for larg group and the decor was fair modern i would say the set up of the actual buffet was rather confus and the food serv didnt seem to be the healthiest option most of the food was of brown or white color not green orang yellow red you know fruit and veggi option a wide select of dessert to tickl your after meal fancithis review is for both red velvet cafe locations

im not say they dont serv delici healthi food im not say their sweet are yummi they are for that im give 2 star howev i wont be return to either locat again

httpwwwreviewjournal

to summar realli quick this articl tell about how peopl love red velvet cafe infam chocol cooki which claim to be onli 27 calori each too good to be true yes a las vega author had these cooki analyz and found out they were actual 157 calori so the sixpack of cooki red velvet claim to be onli 162 calori is actual 942 calori read the articl and judg for yourself

 had red velvet vegan cake mani time the one that are suppos vegan and around 200 calori as i tri to stay fit and eat a sensibl diet i alway appreci establish who offer vegan healthi altern howev if i find a food i realli want it ill buy it sometim regardless of if it lowcalori ill eat a 900calori tripl chocol cake if that what i realli crave but at least i know how much im eating

i know that not all eateri provid their nutrit inform on their food i understand some recip are kept secret howev if you are go to be proud to claim how low calori your delici chocol cooki are they better be true

i just dont appreci the dishonesti red velvet cafe display peopl reli on accur inform on what they eat if that inform is avail now i cannot trust anyth red velvet cafe say about ani of their food can you their food may be delici but their action left a bad tast in my mouthif your a whiski fan this isnt the place for you or vodka  gin for that matter went here for a tour while it was fun and entertain to learn how they distil here their product is someth i cannot endors we tast a few cocktail made with their spirit and then tast all of their vodka i had to spit all of them out everyth tast like bottom shelf cheap liquorand beg for a stomach ach or a nasti hangov 

i will stick to hendrick and speysid whiski i trust the peopl that have been do it for mani yearwent for a 2lb lunch yesterday just to check in on the classic i went in with an open mind but my suspicion were right

th most inconsistentlys shrimp and crawfish of it kind in vega if you order a bag of shrimp here you will get some tini runt and over half of my shrimp head had fallen off by themselv in the bag a telltal sign of nonfresh and this place serv up consist stingi portion  im convinc that they weigh the sauc when they weigh your 1lb bag of food the sauc is not as good as i rememb and though i have fond memori of this chain from year past i feel like hot n juici has becom the pho kim long  lotus of siam of seafoodinabag joint popular becaus of public relat not becaus the food is great hot n juici food is no longer made with love you get a sens that the bottom line is king here more profit  more pr budget  more tv exposur  more firsttim custom  more profit sad one day robin leach will be hot n juici onli custom and hell expect to eat for free becaus that how he rolls

so where to go for cajun seafoodinabag

cravin cajun is so much more consist the crawfish are huge and the shrimp are all 1015 count and you get 1620 in a 1lb bag all of your shrimp head will be intact and the sauc at cravin cajun is straightup tastier pleas if you onli have time for one of these joint tri cravin cajun if you have time for two tri hot n juici so you can make your own judgement if you cant alreadi tell i am passion about this subjecti hate to be the first to review this with such a negat rate unfortun open day did not do the place justic  i understand that open on a friday night has it perk  lot of busi great way to show your nightlif capabl  and show off in general fresh crowd and new peopl to bring in and form into regular etc etc howev if your go to open on a friday and be understaf it not go to go veri smooth  

mi fianc and i show up around 7pm and were sat prompt outsid with no wait which was nice consid all of the peopl that were in the bar area  we didnt notic anyth suspici everyth seem to be in good order and the place was spotless as far as cleanli goe  then we sat down with the menus and were left alon without a drink order  10 minut later our waitress show up and took our order  arnold palmer and a port brew wipeout ipa  anoth 10 minut pass and the arnold palmer and two water show up but no beer  appar theyr out of most of their craft draft and bottl beer due to their soft open the night befor  okay i guess ill order someth els  the waitress excus herself befor i can order a differ beer and i watch as she take order from 5 other tabl around us run to the bar and kitchen twice befor return with anoth arnold palmer  i order a ska beer which one we have two  i know bring me whichev one you have avail right now  she smile and trot away befor we can order food  we sat for anoth 15 minut befor my fianc went up to the bar to order me a beer  the waitress pass us three more time befor she brought out a beer for me ska pinstrip red ale in a bottl  with no glass  but at least she stuck around long enough for us to order some food

dont get me wrong i have noth against suck down a beer straight from the bottl but i wasnt exact drink a corona or a bud lite  even then dont most sport bar  and barsrestaur in general  provid a glass with a can or bottl beer  i can even look past if the glass is frost yes i am a beer snob it happen to be my line of work but to have no option of drink out of a glass seem a littleodd to me  i chalk it up to it be open night again but i was final begin to run out of patienc when our food still hadnt arriv anoth 30 minut later  i think the kicker for me was that the waitress kept zoom past us and offer up
just anoth 2 minut itll be out soon i think it becaus you order the fillet that it take so long thank for hang in there 2 more minut without stop to refil drink or ask if we need anyth els  i actual regret not order appet though we might have been there anoth half hour

10 minut seem to be the trend of the night  i know i know open night later i get the other beer my fianc order at the bar ska modus hoperandi though the bartend was nice enough to give it to me on the hous for wait so long  i could go on and on about how it took us close to an hour and a half to get our food but in the end we did get what we order even after our waitress show up with the next tabl food convinc it was our and it wasnt half bad  it is not food i would gracious wait an hour and a half for but it was satisfi  i order the fillet i believ it call denni fillet cook medium with prosciutto wrap asparagus which seem pretti ritzi for a sport bar menu  but then it came with ranch and all was right with the world and i receiv a slight dri mediumwel steak with blanch asparagus rest on some thick slice ofham  dont get me wrong the food had flavor just not an hour and a half worth  fianc got the blacken cajun chicken sandwich with a side of pasta salad  the chicken had a nice kick probabl couldv been sear a littl more so the spice were more ingrain but you wont hear ani complaint about the pasta salad  it had more flavor than most of my meal combin  

all in all the place has some fantast potenti the locat is spot on for be in downtown chandler and by the time we left there was a littl bit of a wait for peopl to get in to eat while the bar area was jam pack  i plan on revisit in a month or so to see if they can get their act togeth and find their groov  all of the peopl who serv us save for our waitress were veri courteous and help  even if at a snail pace though they didnt like hear that we werent 100 satisfi with our tabl servic hey they ask  im sure this place will pick up some support regular and turn out to be an awesom joint just give it a littl bit of time befor you head in there or at least be prepar to spend 2 hour of your patienc on the staffsad all good thing must come to an end  much like my relationship with los beto so goe mine with filiberto  mayb his cousin will be better

on my last visit the chip were burnt the guac tast old  the chees in the enchilada had resolidifi to some disastr ined wad of nasti  yes i threw out chees  and the bean were justther arent word to express the horror  dri stiff terribl flavor  thank the taco was good as was the rice  it a damn good thing i buy a lot of food

for now i say goodby  but i know in my heart someday ill be back rememb the good time hope he will have changeduntil then i leav an extra star for the memorisorri to all of the peopl who rave about this place but it exceed overhyp 

i was actual realli look forward to this place and had high expect for what was popular which was the adobada and carn asada sinc there was 2 line to order i told porki to wait in the asada line while i wait in the adobada line i made the big mistak of tri to make an order to a wab without porki there i ask for a big adobada fri without cilantro and he repli ok i wait there for about 10 mins

mi bf alreadi got his order and final he ask the wab where my order was in spanish and he repli that i never made an order with him put the blame on me and tri to make me look stupid gtfo  i final got my fri and i went up to the cashier without realiz it the cashier girl gave me an attitud and my bf had to defend me tell them that im pay for the fri and hes pay for the taco sinc i dont know spanish and i didnt understand the situat how rude i do not appreci the fact that i was be put down for not understand ani spanish when we are in a countri that english is the primari languag especi from peopl who sound like they dont even have their citizenship slam fists

in ani case on to the food i look at my food and i specif ask for no cilantro and of cours they would fuck it up by leav littl piec of it all over our food i dont mind the cilantro but porki hate it 1 point there for make me put the effort of play hide and seek with the cilantro the carn asada was ok the meat was tender and juici but bland the onli thing you could realli tast in it was the guacamol sinc they slap on a hand of it on the taco the adobada taco had no flavor whatsoev i read that there was some pineappl slice in it the sauc was amaz but i did not tast anyth on that taco the best one i have had was the stomach and the shoulder i should have fought porki more for the brain tongu and head taco sinc they were all cook in the same way as the shoulder and stomach but i gave in sinc porki was so adam about not tri anyth els never again will i let his close mind affect my choic in food anyway the fri were awesom i love the sauc in it and the fri were the thin and crispi one not those disgust steak fri i just wish i got the carn asada instead becaus the adobada was flavorless and dry

anyway i realli want to like this place becaus i want to come back and tri the other taco quesadilla and tostada but i wouldnt want to come back here by choic becaus of the rude worker and there noth realli special about their popular stuff 2 star for their stomach and shoulder taco and frithis use to be in tivoli but has been move over to sunset park i did not attend the previous locat just this year but ive been to other motley brew organ events

th park has one lane in and out into the park lot the closest park lot was a clusterfuck to get into and had a long queue caus traffic so we park elsewher and walk around the park to get down to the area 

the usual suspect are the line up i usual go pure to those pour out of tap and not bottl then narrow down to most season or specialti brew like joseph jame doe exclus for festiv sinc this was a springsumm fest there is a strong show of lighter fresher style and ipa heavi 

im glad craft beer and event are gain popular event i go to annual are much busier now than they ever been with that though i feel they should make sure the space is far more than adequ sunset park is a larg park and they use part of the lake as a barrier and then put up fenc around the festiv space we were not encroach on the regular park goer space at all so i feel that could have made the space bigger 

if this was held mayb a month ago it would have been perfect weather 
 it was a hot sunni day and that with drink is crappi enough tri to distinguish where long line end and where crowd hang out begin suck tri to squeez through peopl to get place suck 

one big thing for me is that i like to be abl to throw away remnant of my brew wash it out well befor get a new beer i notic some vendor had their own thing behind the bar to do that some didnt and just dump the beer in the grass this is not well prepar at all and was a complaint befor in a review 2 year ago so not a newcom mistak i would use my own water bottl to rins except you know i actual need to have a lot of water becaus it is hot and i alway hydrat so i dont end up as a sick and sorri as the day progress this fest did not provid free water i could fine mayb there was and im wrong  there were food vendor with beverag though i found sporad a tabl with a cooler and a dump bucket but realli it was so hard to jump through the crowd to get to the next area i cant keep go back and forth to the 2 tabl ive found in the park ground to rins and then push through again 

the combin of be hot have to touch and get realli near peopl when im alreadi feel sticki and icki cant find a rins station cant find shade no water made us over it pretti fast im veri thank i got free ticket but im also high reliev i didnt wast money for this

with it grow in popular and is in the 3rd annual state i feel it should have been more thought out and improv each year i hate leav bad review i love support craft beer thing but this simpli was not pleasant i didnt know if i should put aok 3 star or a 2 star but after 2 hour i was done and left to get ice cream in frustrat mayb aok for you but was not for meive been here a hand of time and i am truli amaz at all of the over the top posit review but let get past the hype and into the detail 

i have had the pull pork and it was just meh for me i had the sloppi joe and it was aw i told the owner it was aw and he was a standup guy and gracious enough to replac it with the pull pork  think recent that i was miss the boat i order a cheeseburg with fri and a soda for 924 there are no refil on soda this is probabl design to keep the nearbi high school kid from loiter all afternoon after school the burger tast like it was cook in the morn and reheat it had a char tast to it but quit frank i have had better burger at burger king the fri were way over season and did not tast good and were thrown away

so i feel like i can go to whataburg down the street and get a much better tast burger fri and free refil for a lesser priceorder deliveri from these guy last week was pretti excit about a bbq place be nearbi that delivered

th deliveri took almost an hour and a half about 30 min longer than i was origin told

i got the three meat two side combo for 1999 the rib and hot link were good the brisket was just ok neither the bake bean nor the potato salad particular impress me 

the real deal breaker for me was the sauc it was just not good it was bitter and tast more like a vinaigrett than a bbq sauc 

kind of a disappoin i hate to jump on the vega has no good barbecu bandwagon but everi place ive tri has either been inconsist adam rib or overpr lucill memphi championship bbq if anyon has a good suggest for vega bbq im all earfirst order februari 2013 i pick up a russo special which was top with pepperoni sausag mushroom bell pepper and onion  the pizza was mediocr all the way and we were in no rush to order from here again  

second order septemb 2013 we had last minut guest come over to watch the sunday afternoon footbal game  sinc this is the closest pizza to my hous i gave it anoth shot and order a larg sausag mushroom for pickup  this pizza was actual pretti great  even our guest thought so and i was pleasant surpris  i couldnt believ this was the same place to be honest  

third order novemb 2013 an old buddi live in boston was rave about chicken parm sandwich around the fenway area  so that got me think to the last time i had a great chicken parm sub which was probabl when clinton was presid  i bit the bullet and got one to go  although the bread was decent the chicken was bland and under season as was the tomato sauc  it was pretti blah overal  the sub came with a small side of potato salad that was frozen  my initi thought was that the crunch in my mouth was celeri but it was ice  nice  

i call to inform them of this and the cashier simpli just said sorri  the owner call me 3 minut later to apolog again  he said there was someth wrong with his fridg everyth froze over and blame his cook for not noticing

il probabl end up order from here again due to proxim but will drive that extra few mile to get pizza elsewher for sure  i wonder how mani pizza chef they have  mayb i need to obtain their shift scheduli was go to let it pass and not write anyth until i got up motiv to give them anoth chanc but after the coupl of amaz afterglow review i had to write to give warn your experi may differ   we arriv after 9 and despit their close at 10 if not exact feel of leisur there was not one of be rush though we had a feel the kitchen was  food 2 pizza arriv prompt one good the goat chees pizza though have had better for less elsewher the other with prosciutto extra crispi  blacken burnt crust utter devoid of ani trace of moistur  dri dri dri  hard  brittl 

like the general ambianc though rather dark to read the menus and the nois level was rather high  servic was decent and fast  after have just recent made first visit to the parlor howev it was a poor show by comparison as far as tast  price  gourmet inde   

base on this one singl visit to paraphras a quot misattribut to winston churchil humbl pie has much to be humbl about  ill give them anoth chanc but probabl not until there anoth groupon or monsoon dealthis place will probabl not make it for anoth year

tortilla and meat are of lowqual we do not need anoth mediocor taco joint in this town weve got filiberto for that

two word overpr mehso ya want food beer boob and sport huh like most who tri to do it all this place excel at none

if you want great food go to cibo
if you want great beer go to the roosevelt tavern or lost leaf

al of those are within a few block of this place

sorri bjs bottom line all show no goaloha

yelp 365 challenge40365 the yard housecheesecak factori wannabi was truli excit to tri five guy becaus of all the wonder thing ive heard and basic the hype around it my brother and i ventur one afternoon and i was less than pleas i did enjoy the fact that everyon was extrem friend and not be charg for extra patti plus the restaur itself is nice and i was mesmer by the hightech soda machin i wish i were abl to util it but no soda for me 

our cashier also realli nice and friend was clueless about their ingredi their menu state one of the top to be green pepper and sinc i was unfamiliar with their burger i ask her what type of green pepper the menu was refer confus i continu are they green bell pepper green chili pepper the cashier respond oh yeah theyr pepper but uh i dont think theyr spici all rightso i thought okay some roast or marin green pepper that sound good on a burger so i order two patti with green pepper onion lettuc and tomato my brother and i share regular fri and cajun fries

you can imagin my disappoint when i open my wrapper and realiz that my first assumpt of green bell pepper was right but the cashier fail not onli to acknowledg that thought but told me otherwis how can you not know that your restaur serv green bell pepper i amount this to hope ignor it didnt add to a good experi for me becaus had i known they were bell pepper i wouldnt have order it who want raw bell pepper on their burger it was so awkward plus my burger was absolut flavorless i actual had to season my own burger with salt and pepper i probabl should have order chees and condiment but a good burger shouldnt have to reli on those accompani the burger was tender and cook well though the fri were also good i love handcut fri so this was no except the cajun fri though i will pass i love cajun season but i felt like i was insid their shaker of cajun it was so overwhelm that it took away from the pleasantri of the fries

i dont know my brother realli enjoy his burger and i take partial blame for not order my burger with chees and other condiment to add flavor i was tri to be healthier but the burger shouldnt be flavorless alon the fri are realli great though without the cajun drown so i may take anoth stab at five guy  get a complet differ burger and enjoy the frieswel seei saw a realli great show here with my girlfriend and friend  the venu itself i think has too mani bizarr rule and they are pretti disorganized

go to take a piss id just bought a beer and hey i kinda like piss with a beer  it fun  abov the urin they have these metal deal that are perfect for set a drink on in fact i cant think of a singl other applic in which they might come in handi  as i walk in this secur dude goe hey  you cant bring your beer in there and im like well im gonna set it down right here then when i came out fuck my beer was gone and so was the secur dude  thank asshol this place doesnt charg you up the ass for a drink or anyth anyway

lat on that night the bar lost my friend atm card and as she period check the balanc she saw that at least one charg she wasnt present for at 2 went through  lovely

th venu itself is fine in term of set up  it could stand to be bigger becaus this fucker get pack to the gill and appar it get ten time more pack than it was when i saw iti am go to break the heart and mind of mani as i write this review 

chide as you must  i speak onli the truth 

i will first admit that i am far closer to the classless slob end of the spectrum than an appreci of fine cuisine

i will second admit that i came here on a pay what you like night so i may have never ventur in here otherwise

i will third admit that half the reason my experi was so shit was becaus everyon els was die over their food say it was the greatest thing they had ever tasted

i will fourth admit that i am a vegetarian so i have zero opinion of the duck or the quail or the lamb or whatever

i will fifth admit that i had no idea what spelt was when i order it not that i realli had ani choic this was the onli vegetarian option

i will sixth admit that the dessert were more than five star 

now that i have explain all the reason behind my opinion realli not matter to you on the topic  i shall give you my opinion 

serious a fuck five star restaur that get noth but amaz perfect rave review doesnt have anyth brilliant and special to offer a nonmeat eater in 2012 in a fair hip citi in europ 

was it horrend no 
was it better than a chees and onion sandwich from tesco just 

mayb im wrong but i think it pretti standard to make sure there a coupl of decent option for veggi on the menu and this place didnt at all 

not to mention the one option wasnt even an option at all it was an appet turn meal 

mayb have one option would have been fine if it wasnt so obvious that no one gave a shit about that option and in turn in my mind peopl who dont eat meat and the duck was go to be perfect defined
th quail was go to make you orgasm with joy 
the lamb was go to melt in your mouth
th steak was go to be heaven on a fork

and the spelt was alway go to be crap in comparison 

the dessert made up for it be the worst meal ever but not enoughtri great bao for the first time a week ago i came with an open mind and heart especi hear so mani wonder thing about this place i was left disappoint 

the woman work the food truck was not friend at all never said one word to us no hello how are you or even hey this is what is popular on our menu my friend and i got the pork belli boa and we werent fan i had never had such a doughi bun it was pure white and look as it wasnt cook im sure it was the pork was complet fatti and i usual like that but pair with the weird douchi textur i wasnt a fan love the littl carrot and minc top on top but it wasnt someth i would tri again

if i do comeback ill br tri someth els for surefirst crawfish joint ive tri in las vega and it practic minut away from where i resid veri spacious love the decor and sink outsid the restroom for easi access to wash your hand i attend toni ts uye event for this place and love see yelper want to tri someth new

unfortun this was a miss for me not so much on the food but the servic itself i ordered

1 crab cake appetizer
1 lbs of shrimplemon pepper seasoningmild
sid order of cajun sausag and sweet potato tots

th shrimp came out  befor my appet that okay but damn get my order right at least two bag came to me that wasnt mine what a teas and i dont like to be teas especi when im hungri the third was what i order but had a corn on the cob ad to it i told the server this isnt mine sinc i onli order the shrimp she told me that what i order with the lemon pepper mild sauc and walk away wow okay yeah so im hold this bag of hot shrimp ask everybodi at the tabl if they order a corn on the cob with shrimp and nobodi did so instead of the server that complet ignor me at the counter i had to flag one guy server that notic me wave at him i told him the situat and he said to just keep the corn and he wont charg me for it well that great if i like corn but i dont care for it so i gave it away to a yelper that actual was go to eat it 

the shrimp was good nice plump size great portion and the sauc had enough heat to give it that spice to make it a delici treat they had latex glove and plastic glove for your perus i pick the plastic i think the latex glove are better sinc my finger were still stain even though i had the plastic glove on there were right amount of spice and garlic i had a piec of garlic bread from my brother that was eat with his girlfriend across the way i would say the dip of that bread with the lemon pepper sauc was crazi delici i could eat loav with that combin 

crab cake was bland mushi no flavor for the life of it and serious was miss someth i felt like i was eat shred soggi mush for 11 this was a major disappoint sinc im a huge fan of crab cake i even ask the server if this was realli good she repli oh yes it so good i despis liar this was not good at all i high recommend not to order this appet the onli thing good about this dish was the sauc without it it would have been a complet disast and i would have ask to send it back to order someth els i ask the server how is it cook she believ it fri happi to hear in that case the outer patti would have at least had some crisp to it or someth not one crisp area you know when a toast bread get soak in water that the textur the tast was off no fresh veri plain jane uninterest i could go on but

th server thought i order sweet potato fri and question me if i was sure that what i order sinc that what she had in her hand to give me i had to tell her a few time no i know what i order and it was sweet potato tot ever sinc i had some from a food truck last week ive been have this new love for tot made from sweet potato im think whi question me what i order when i just told you what i order kiddin me and there is a big differ between fri and tot so if that server was think i would still take it even though that wasnt what i want the answer would be a big fat no i wont order someth i dont want period the tot when they final did arriv was hot and had a good amount of crunch the flavor was on point and this was my favorit from everyth i order this could easili be a dessert if you have some leftov sinc it cold and almost like mini bite of sweet 

i was plan on tri out one of their dessert but the servic render me to call it a night 

the bill came and luckili i check what i order i thought i was miss someth and notic i was charg for a side of sausag that i didnt even get when i told that server that i never receiv it she question me again ask oh realli you didnt get it uhm i would know what i ate and yes i didnt eat ani sausag the last time i check hmm wait that didnt sound right haha you know what i mean come on  so she said she would take it off the bill im wait for my new revis bill and shes wait for me to pay her without revis it first uhm anoth no ill wait for my revis bill in case you jack me again thank you veri much smh

love get togeth with fellow yelper but didnt enjoy the servic food could be better but overal the shrimp and sweet potato tot were wonder here 

heard onc you tri hot n juici youll never come back here either way i dont plan on come backi went to ncounter becaus of yelp

waaay overr in my opinion after you order at the counter you have to fight for a tabl if you have more than two peopl in your group there was relat fast turnov but it annoy have to cherrypick someon tabl hope theyll leav after their last bite but be a saturday morn be busi wasnt a deal breaker

when i receiv my omelett the chees was partial melt and rather tasteless the egg were rubberi like someth youd get at a cheap buffet the potato were ok but didnt compens for the rest overal the portion size were small and the food was just mediocr im not a picki breakfast person but i would rather go to denni or ihop than come back to ncounter

if your look for good breakfast in temp near mill your not far from harlow essenc bakeri cafe boa or even us eggit not enough to inspir me to chang the star rate on my review but it is worth note that david the general manag of rice and compani contact me to express his concern and regret about the lack of servic i receiv on my visit that the kind of attent to custom i would have like while i was at the restaur mayb there will be some kind of trickl down effect or whatev the econom term might be but doubt ill volunt to test that firsthand the next time im in town12 for turkey burger slider would be worth it if they were good

it was just ground turkey thrown on the grill no season total bland 

mi friend said her 17 salad was miser the shrimp was overcook and all she could tast was grill burn marks

our waitress was mia and  we wont be backnot sure how legit the review are so far but good job get me to check this place out third restaur in this locat sinc tsq open good luck i was a fan of both previous busi 

we just made it for the end of happi hour and they were nice enough to let us slide a coupl of minut longer to choos our appet all the happi hour app were 2 a piec pretti sweet price we got 3 glass of newcastl werewolf beer never had that befor and it was a veri good brew 

happi hour app 

we got the beef slider which were differ the patti were batter and deep fri it was certain juici but then again how could a deep fri hamburg patti be ani other way i prefer regular slider though do brit realli do it this way 

got a mini chicken pot pie and steak pot pie these were decent my wife prefer beef pot pie with ground beef but i like it with a whole piec of steak good flavor and someth i would definit get again 

the chip were the most disappoint they came with a curri dip that was too mild and wateri the fri were serv so rare that we actual sent them back i have never sent back fri in my life and in a place that suppos british unreal 2nd batch of fri were accept but still veri meh 

this place has lot of promis though the breakfast menu look yummi and the weekday lunch deal could be a knockout for lunch you get an entre and then for 5 more you can get all you can drink british beer that sound like a heckuva fun midday they have a 10 bottomless offer for mimosa bloodi mari and bellini for breakfast but it onli for 9am11am  still decent and a better drink deal than anywher els nearbi  their sunday roast which start in a coupl of week could be great too 

the english afternoon tea time is someth that should be target to mom with kid or mayb guy that drink with their pinki stick out how about more than just 1 tv in the place a whole tv schedul of soccer perhap 

i feel bad about this 2 star review onli becaus the staff was realli friend and person  but i have to call it like i see it  i hope to bump it up a star on my next visit  i know ill be back for the bottomless beer lunch one of these day    

conclus mayb this is british  but i like the crown and anchor kind of british much much more with dart jukebox more tvs the occasion stupid wanker patron and better chipthis review refer to the afternoon tea servic onli 

mi husband is english and so i cajol him into tri the cream tea here one afternoon the servic was incred friend so i feel pretti much like the devil to have to do this but

th sandwich were stale with that horribl old crust feel the scone werent fresh but reheat in a microwav the clot cream was more like whip cream the cake were still frozen in the middl make it pathet obvious that the chef just lop them off a larger block of orderedin cake taken straight from the walkin fridg thank good they had pg tip tea to somewhat redeem this entir offering

how can a place that call itself quintessenti british pass this stuff off to their custom i felt embarrass for the waiter who be english must know fullwel how off everyth is or is the whole kitchen quiet laugh to themselv silli american theyll eat anyth if we tell them it authentic

th kicker to the whole thing was that the price for this cream tea 18 was a perperson cost not per coupl as id stupid assum thirtysix dollar for that big of a disappoint bum me out even now four day later 

well be stick to have tea time at our hous where the bread hasnt been sit out on the counter all daythere is noth special about this place at all they charg you 75 for fresh jalapeno  first of all they arent fresh they are pickl  second they have a condiment tabl where u can get your own pickl jalapeno and easili throw them on your burger just like they did 
now for their chees i will not eat a burger without chees but their chees was so bad that i rather eat the burger plain it tast like water down kraft american chees singles
th lettuc in the burger was limp had no crunch no flavor it was realli dark it did not look appet at all 
the meat was ok but i think it was a littl over done 
the onli good thing i have to say about this meal was the fri2 word for you five guy best burger ever flame burger not good the bun was soggi the burger flavorless  the waffl fri also soggi mayb they should chang their name to soggi burger not impress five guy is the place to go for amazflame burger more like lame burger this restaur oper in what was an abandon el pollo loco and not much effort to clean up the dirt left behind has been made the sidewalk are filthi and for as new as this restaur is the dine room isnt much better i tri the chili burger and an all beef hot dog the burger patti was dri and kinda crunchi not veri substanti the chili was made of  and basic tast like salt water the hot dog 229 was not veri substanti but was of decent qualiti and tast alright the ice was veri far from fresh and a switch to diet coke wasnt much better veri wateri the staff was friend but they dont realli seem to have it togethi feel bad for this place in a way becaus i have a feel that they are not go to be around for veri long while the servic was fast and friend the atmospher was cold and the food was subpar i order what i thought was go to be a chicago dog as that is what it was call but it didnt come with ani of the chicago dog top mustard celeri salt pepper pickl tomato hello it was a simpl small hot dog with ketchup mustard relish and onion this was the kind of hot dog i would make at home the waffl fri were decent but the sauc they gave me with them was not appeal at all it had a funki color to it with a funki tast to match my co worker order a gyro and was disappoint she said that the meat tast like it was frozen and then warm on the grill we were think it would be fresh slice gyro meat i dont rememb the price be over high but they were not good either for the amount and qualiti of food you got in ani event this place is kinda depress and i would not returnwas realli hope to find an altern to my favorit chicken place as i suffer intens guilt everi time i go there due to the fact that our famili valu are not align unfortun rais cane was not the answer

ther is not a singl healthi way to order  serious you cant put someth green on the menu say a few strip on a bed of lettuc as an option 

it chicken strip fri bread and slaw option period the onli question is a matter of specif quantiti the chicken was good but not as good and there is one type of sauc for dip and i do not care for it  

so i tri but it look like ill still be battl my conscienc next time im crave a chicken sandwich we were there tuesday march 13th
 
     this bakeri was just okay not so satisfi my advis is keep on walk to the next one

     i will not come back that for sure i feel like becaus we had our backpack on we were treat less than the busi peopl that were come in like hello our money is just as worthi so pleas show a littl more attent and care next time to other backpack that is becaus we wont go back 

      also the food was just okay it seem like they have more pasta and sandwich than bake item besid our turkey sandwich lack flavor or someth it could have been better overal wast of time and moneynot as impress as i was hope it to be the thought of dim sum in henderson was thrill but the food was lacklust part of it was my fault for not get over there dure prime dim sum time but serv the tail end at these expens price was ridicul 

between a friend and i we got ten dish the usual suspect of har gow shu mai and chicken feet are a stapl of everi visit to a dim sum joint by far my favorit out of these were the chicken feet there wasnt anyth wrong flavor wise with the other two but they were lukewarm and the wrapper were dri out i also order some intestin and watch as they went from room temperatur to congeal within 1015 minut the xo noodl were dri and flavorless roll them around in the chili sauc help but they sank like a rock in my stomach could explain the indigest i was experienc throughout the rest of the day then the shrimp noodl were alright in textur but the sauc was water down and didnt contribut much to the dish the gai lan was a bright green color and crisp as much as you can ask for with a blanch veget dish with the limit select of dish we end up order potstick and seawe salad the sad part was that the latter of the two dish was probabl my favorit of the whole meal on our last attempt we got the taro cake when i bit into one it was cold this surpris me becaus it was not on the cart dure the first second or third pass i had assum it had came out fresh from the kitchen but it had came out of the fri pan and sat there for at least half an hour to an hour

th servic was not bad the peopl were quick to attend to us we got approach by three differ peopl for drink order the lack of abil to communic was a hindranc but they were attent the ladi push the cart were friend and kept tri to explain what they had 

they do not have the dri chili in oil which is one of my favorit part of dim sum for two peopl we end up pay 45 dollar befor tip usual this amount is enough to feed three of us more dish be order and we all end up satisfipricey high forgett pizza there was noth uniqu or special about this pizza  not it bland sauc dri thin crust tasteless top or it overal tast our bartenderserv was veri person and nice thank god there was beer we had a larg with pepperoni and mushroom 35 for a pizza and two beersid rather grate off my nippl with a chees grater than rush back here ani time soon i do not get the hype surround this placemeh i realli want to like buldogi but it just didnt live up to the yelp hype 

i dont expect a hot dog restaur to be extrem fanci but with the word gourmet in the name they could work on the decor a littl bit one of the thing that realli bother me was the excess use of demand signag everywher within the restaur there was one that specifi that there is a 2 napkin limit allow per custom which is ridicul when you realiz how messi these hotdog realli are appar there a camera watch you abov the napkin dispens  so i took 5 what can i say im a littl rebel

i order the angri dog which was spici pork asian slaw spici mayo and jalapeño fresh raw jalapeño on top of a hot dog these thing are massiv and i would recommend share with a friend if you want to order fri as well i felt like the top were just too much at one time i dont think i appreci meat on meat on meat but that could be just me it was salti and overwhelm rather than complementari i think that their execut could be done with more finess and it look as though everyth was just thrown on

i also had the carn asada fri which were pretti averag as well upon further thought i realiz i shouldv order the angri kimchi sweet potato fri which seem to be more popular and could have balanc out the salti of the hot dog 

i mean the meat are good but not extraordinari same goe for the top combin with the averag servic they complet forgot my best friend order and averag decor i realli dont have the urg to return anytim soon plus im still thirsti from the hot dog i ate 5 hour agogreat go down not so great later 

mi roomat and i discov this place about 2 year ago and sinc then have eaten there 12 dozen time or so the cliff note is that all the food is delici but it is sooo richfattyterr for you that there is usual a great deal of time later spent nurs a stomach ach perhap we are just get old and cant take it anymor but we had to stop go becaus it just wasnt worth the tears

let me explain more we basic focus our order on thing on the menu that have both pork belli and garlic mayonais so it could just be the combin of these two ingredi that is wage a thermo nuclear war on our insid but damnit those are the best thing on the menu what are we suppos to do eat some veget not in america chief 


the insid not veri glamor or invit defin a take out style placethis new concept of fast soup and salad servic just doesnt make it for me  i like the origin sweet tomato full servic soup and salad bar on stephani but this one just doesnt satisi  i stop in to get a quicki lunch and it was  you have your choic of 6 soup and a salad that is custom made by the server as you walk the line  i got an 8 oz cup of their delici chicken noodl soup includ chunk of chicken and simpl salad  the price with tax came to just over 1100
no valu here  you can go to the soup and salad bar on stephani and for 899 get all the soup you can eat all the salad you can eat you make your own there sever differ type of other salad such as macaroni broccoli cole slaw etc bake potato pasta bar includ mac and chees pizza muffin and sever dessertsthat is an all you can eat buffet so the concept is what im use to at st
i didnt feel i got my money worth at the express  whi didnt they put a full size sweet tomato on this side of town   we all agre we would have prefer that with so mani place to eat surround this one i cant imagin spend 1100 for soup and salad  make no mistak the  qualiti and fresh are still evid here i just dont get the express thing

you can eat in  there are sever booth insid take it home or take it out on their  patio the drawback is that the patio is locat right on eastern with all of the traffic and gas fume along with the nois  not cool 
i live right up the road but wont go back   i will continu to go to the origin st on stephaniim a big fan of the meat and veget free for all that is the mongolian concept but the qualiti doesnt match the price  sorri guy but 14 for that kind of lunch doesnt cut itthe room was visual appeal with it old hollywood style decor complet with cinemat reel on the ceil but we were seat near the too noisi bar area and the all too frequent arctic gust of wind detract from ani sort of comfort level

soon after we were seat our drink arriv how cool is that not the arctic wind blast but that they could read my mind without take my order first  it actual took some more than necessari convinc befor our waiter final relent that we did not in fact order those drink nor had we order anyth yet

when our cocktail did arriv the unev hillbilli beef brisket infus bloodi mari was accompani by a wedg of last week dri and tire lime the lonni martini was fortun garnishless and pleasant

on of the thing that generat a vast culinari sad in me is an bad bread experi and what arriv was a whole basket of it  what should have been delect bacon  cherri bread baguett slice and parmesan crisp were horrif stale apparit of their former selv there is never an excus for stale bread  never

w had

lukewarm french onion soup which was tasti but not except  

free rang chicken with mushroom risotto nuesk bacon and babi mustard green  the chicken was overcook and dri the risotto was pasti and fair

short rib bourguignon meh

w did not have

th side dish we order which never arrived

for dessert we rush to trader joe to pick up some sweet to comfort ourselv at home  there is just so much disappoint mediocr food  poor servic one can enduri realli want to like this place dure our 3night stay in vega my husband and i plan one romant prici restaur night to get away from the crazi of the strip and the casino we chose the barrymor becaus the menu look amaz and the restaur was high rate 

the food was inde fantast and i would give the barrymor 5 star for just the food unfortun the servic was terribl when we arriv there was just one other coupl finish up their meal in the restaur we order our food and wine and while the wine arriv veri quick the bread took quit a long time in the meantim three other larg tabl were seat ask for their order and were brought bread odd but this is not the reason for by 2 star review befor move on though i just want to mention that one of the bread that they serv has bacon in it if your a vegetarian watch out

lat the lobster macaroni and chees appet arriv and was amaz the problem were entir in the servic of the entre my husband order a special and i order salmon upon order the waiter misheard salmon and ask if i said same i told him that i actual said salmon and write my order down he reiter salmon what came out an hour later were two of the special not a big deal  we told them that my order was actual the salmon and the waiter unapologet whisk my meal away 

for the next thirti minut i watch my husband eat his entre as i sat eat noth now im not in the restaur busi and im not sure what the protocol is for an incorrect entre but i dont think the right thing to do is to leav one person out of a coupl with no food while the other is awkward forc to eat his food alon so it doesnt get cold i took a bite of my husband dish and it was delici but it was his meal and i was still wait for mine so i just sat there stare at my fork as he uncomfort ate his meal waiter and waitress pass us and no one seem to think that this dynam was odd 

the cherri on top was when our bill arriv the restaur attempt to charg us for two of the special instead of one special and one salmon the price differ between the special and the salmon was 15 i point this out to the waiter and he veri unapologet said that this was the check for what he thought we order i was actual expect them to perhap discount my entre or mayb provid a free dessert as an apolog for the awkward meal due to my incorrect entre but instead they tri to charg me 15 more for my meal

thi restaur is quit expens and we were spend quit a chunk of chang on a full meal with a bottl of wine in exchang what we hope for was a pleasant meal that we could share togeth unfortun the barrymor did not delivbeauti space  inspir locat  light  bright  airi  

scatter servic   brought out hot plate but didnt bring food out until the plate had gotten cold

runn refil our sparkl water the first time with tap the second with tea  didnt replac the bottl of sparkl water that was essenti ruin didnt offer tap when we ran out of sparkl  whi reorder when theyd just screw up the second bottl  

aw food  so disappoint by the food that is so not worthi of michel richard name that i actual cri  i ador michel  my husband ador michel  we want this to be all weve dream of it be sinc i learn he was take over the space and kick ourselv for not have the idea first 

bar food  chicken wing  meh   way to messi for me  calamari  crispi but the sauc were uninspir and dull  

starter   salad with goat chees  love 

onion and bacon tart  frozen and reheat  still cold  would have been delici if it were cook through  but the fact that i was abl to discern that it had been frozen sicken me 

steak tartar  gloppi sticki mess  textur was not what i expect from this french chef  fri were delici hot and crispi   


entre  dri chicken  yes the suppos miracul rotisseri chicken  ined  one bite and wish id not taken it  

t bone steak  with king crab  sound delici right  sad disgust  oversalt becaus the sauc was made with base  and cover the entir steak  serv with frozen king crab leg  rubberi tasteless still frozen  aw  worst surf  turf ive had in vega period  hell worst steak  

lamb shank with polenta  delicious

sid  haricot vert  frozen  i swear  anoth tear  mash potato could have been use for wallpap past     

dessert  napoleon was cheesecak factori size and actual embarrass me  aw  hate it

molten chocol was nasti 

we ask the server to pick his two favorit dessert  suffic it to say we were complet underwhelmedand it did not redeem the disastr meal wed endured

michel pleas dont set up a restaur like this and leav townyouv not got the right peopl in place to maintain consist qualiti and to oper a 247 oper with your name on the door  we were there on a veri slow monday night at 8pm  i was sad and embarrass for you and doubli devast that this precious rare dinner that i was abl to share with my husband was so memor for it aw    the check ad insult to injurimy og ryan b and i had a date for a littl foodi crawl and we decid to check out 28go we arriv and were disappoint to find out that they were close until later in the week thwart we decid to head across town dure rush hour no less to check out anoth spot he had been want to check out in chinatown we walk in and i was alreadi not feel it the theme is cute but not execut as well as it could be the atmospher just left a lot to be desir so i was have misgiv befor i even order look at the menu noth realli spark much interest in me so i decid to order the spici tom yum with udon and tofu think it was a relat safe bet ryan b order the beef fri rice and a tempura appet 

our meal came out and there was an odd smell eman from the bowl almost a littl dirti smellingi let it sit for a while so i could build up enough courag to take a bite i kept tri and tri and even took two bite befor i total gave up the flavor and smell were so off im not one to send food back so i was reluct to do it i final decid to let them know that i realli didnt like my dish and ask our waitress to return it to the kitchen our server was veri kind and apologet quick remov the dish and told me she would remov it from our check i realli appreci the servic and how friend they were about it i realli didnt want to send my dish back so i was glad that they werent too offend 

while i watch ryan eat i tri a piec of the tempura had order and it wasnt great a littl over batter and seem like the frozen kind you buy prepackag at the store just not fresh and lack flavor he seem to enjoy his fri rice the onli save grace for this restaur was the friend servic but i wont be backyes it a new place get lot of buzz  it also way too small to handl the crowd theyr get  have to stand around wait for one of the few tables
th bagel was no better than the one you get at smith  the french toast noth to write home about and the sausag serv with it was cut up in littl piec and cold
employe veri friend but that didnt make up for the uncomfort feel while wait for a tabl the lack of silverwar on tabl the food serv on plastic plate yuk no s  p shaker to be found etc
theyr sudden success and rave review may kill them befor theyr establish and can correct the abov problemi was quit disappoint in my last encount with bread and butter  my friend and i came here about 2 week ago for lunch  now their menu hasnt chang much but the qualiti in the product use to make their dish has chang  or so i could tast  now i alway get my favorit dish lox and bagel  now what can go wrong with this  a decreas portion a bagel that was not toast and a differ qualiti of lox be serv  i usual dont complain much about my food hahaor do i but the dish i got this time was not the same as i use to have befor especi the salmon  at the time it wasnt that busi too so i dont know what went wrong with this dine in experi i was a bit disappoint to see a place where i use to enjoy dine at have a chang in the qualiti of it food  

anoth thing to add was that the silverwar in the tin can are not the most sanitari  the first fork i pull out had some dri food stuck to it so i went to the waitress for a new pair  she hand me one and to my surpris this also had food stuck to it too  second time was a charm  clean forksor i hope they were  see this kind of decreas my appetit a bitjust say  

servic was great  everyon was nice and attent just qualiti of the restaur has gone down

i dont know if i will return we will seelive social brought us to this place  it locat in old town near all of the nightlif  howev it kind of tuck away on a side street one block away from most of the action  ive driven past this place at least a dozen time and didnt notic it

w went dure the middl of the week when it not full of youngster and partier  when we walk in i notic it smell like a colleg barmusti greasi alcohollyi that a word  those of you whove been in these kind of bar know what im talk about

w tri sever menu item here burger onion ring mozzarella stick etc  all of them were mediocr at best  perhap i would have a differ opinion and tast if it didnt smell so bad in there

anoth thing that annoy me is the prize wheel they have in the lower bar area  it a giant wheel like you see at a casino except that it has nail and a metal strip to stop itwhen we were here some colleg kid were spin this thing for no reason and it made a godaw sound clang like a cowbel but 100x wors  of cours none of the staff care to stop themthi went on for 1015 minutes

th 2nd time we drop by the air condition wasnt work and it was muggi in the restaurantplus the elev to the 2nd floor broke down with sever colleg kid stuck insid so the fire depart had to come rescu thembig drama in numbnutzville

overal it was a terribl experi  there are lot of better option out there

return factor  2here is the deal with nami i like you i do but you just arent friend  i have been in there multipl time and i would love to buy multipl thing but i feel like i am bother all of you 

tonight i ask a question about ice cream  i want enough to take home for me and my roommat to share and have some for the weekend  but you never let me get there and i end up with a cup full of ice cream for just him

mi advic would be take the time to find out what someon want complet befor check out of the convers  and dont look complet piss when i ask you what someth is it make me feel like i am bother you and it make you look like a jerk

i will say if there was anoth place to go that had everyth you did i would never go to you again until you chang your wick wayi am sorri this place is beauti to look at but the food is a huge disappoint  i wish i didnt have to say it but citi hall is better  i should start from the beginning

i had been look forward to come here so by the time our reserv roll around i was readi to eat  we arriv about 15 min befor our reserv and proceed to the bar to order a drink 

first the access to the bartend was imposs and when we final order my boyfriend had his drink in a few minut and my glass of champagn no where to be seen  we will revisit this later  we wait for 10 min befor the rest of our parti show and we were seat  

note  they do have good music and you can sit at the grand piano and have app and cocktail  the live music is a great cover

upon sit we prompt notifi our waiter that we had not paid for our drink at the bar and that i had order a glass and never receiv it  he then took our drink order and return with the beverag and i final receiv my glass  about 5 min after that the server come back with the first glass i order sit down a 20 min old champagn that was flat and room temperatur at that point  and proceed to charg me for it  he appear to think this was an accomplish that he found the glass i was at this point just annoy and thought it was poor taste

th food  such promis to fall so flat the menu doe offer a varieti other than steak but a larger seafood select and some chef special  

app  we order the calamari and the burrata with roast pepper  whi they give 1 piec of crostini for 4 peopl i dont understand  i had to ask for extra 2x and then is drop about 7 piec on the plate  overkill

th calamari was decent but noth to rave about the bread is lighter and there are two dip sauc and remulaud and cocktail

i order the bone in filet medium this is were i just get upset  it come out half well done and the other half raw i am not even sure how one can achiev cook a steak that bad but it was the wors i have ever had ever  

side  famili style so if you order 1 side will split 4 way easi the server said that it would serv 4 top but i think it could push serv 6 peopl  we had the gouda chees au gratin cold  undercooked

broccoli  undercook and hard in fact i realli want to send it back but at this point it was just pointless  i realli just want to finish my meal

gnocchi  has to come from a bag no one would make gnocchi that big and you could bare tast the lobster in it  

needless to say just the whole place fell flat  the servic wasnt bad but not steller as i would except for a 700 meal 4 peopl and booz included

they are suppos to have anoth bar and water featur up stair on the 3rd level they were at capac so we were not allow to check it out  i think the place my stay busi becaus of locat and the crowd is definit a certain crowd  howev i will be stay to old faith full citi hall in old towndominick is a vega style restaur that has taken over the like of the scottsdal quarter  although they have the glitz and glamour i didnt feel their food held up to the price or glitz

they use a spice rub on their steak that most of the guest didnt enjoy and the fish i order was quit bland except for the excess amount of salt they use on it  i would have to say that the side dish were a disappoint as well  the tatertot although they sound fun werent edibl due to the amount of greas they had in them and the mac  chees wasnt veri good either  again everyth was season with excess amount of salt

overal the parti of 8 i was with didnt enjoy this overpr meali had never been to dominick and i like tri new restaur so i was excit to check it out  we had a reserv for 8 pm on saturday night and when we show up the restaur was busi  it definit is cater to those that want to be seen and show off what they have  as we were walk up they had 67 of your finest vehicl back in right next to the front door

cal it a front door is a littl mislead howev  i found it interest for such a nice restaur to have a revolv door as there entranc  onc insid the door you are greet by what is a darken liberac type decor  think big chandeli and crush velvet  we were seat prompt for our 8 pm reservation

top line the food was mediocr  we between the 4 of us we order the  scallop halibut and the ribey as our entre  for our side we order the potato gnocchi and cream corn as our side  the main issu that we all had with the food was that it was veri salti  at one point my buddi across the tabl ask me  doe your tast realli salti i answer yes and everybodi els chime in that their was quit salti as well  i dont know if the chef was have a bad night but if not he need to pump the brake on his salt usage

fin this place isnt the cheapest place  i am not one to complain about price and i eat at fine dine restaur on a week basi as part of my job  our bill for the 4 of us was 500  we did have a coupl drink a piec but the price we paid did not match the qualiti of food we received

mi advic is to check out the bar for a few drink and enjoy the peopl watch  think phoenix open  otherwis if you are look for a good steakhous head across the street to ocean clubrealli terribl custom service

walk up with a friend on a busi saturday night no wait at the door but no open tabl the 3 hostess stood there stare at us  no hi no welcom to cogburn noth i said hi there 2 of us and she said were full you can check outsid that was my first clue on their bad servic we end up sit outsid under their mister which spew so much water that we liter had to drag our heavi tabl to the other end of the patio becaus our hair cloth and even our menus were get soak the waitress watch us drag our tabl and didnt offer to help or even comment on the situat she check on us dure our stay a fair amount until the end of the night came we sat with empti glass and plate for almost 20 minut befor she came by to see if we want anyth els then it took anoth 10 minut to bring the bill the place was empti by this point in the night then after wait 10 minut with our credit card on the tabl i had to take them insid myself to tri and find the waitress aaaaand where did i find her just insid the door talk to a friend loud about a relationship issu she was have she look at me like i was be rude ask her to run my credit card 

mi note to the owner of cogburn talk to your young staff member about the import of custom servic decent food will onli get you so far there are sever other bar im the east valley with equal or better food qualiti with custom servic that surpass what your staff is offer 

the 2nd star was given for the wing they were nice and crispi on the outsid and tender on the insid the raspberri chipotl sauc was tastinever again the  inconsist are too frequent and the price is too high

 chicken is onc again reheat and not cook to order
 servic is hit or miss
 for the silli high price 1315 for a dish that is 9 anywher els you would think they could afford good plate everyth is cheap plastic and it shows

thi is embarrass for thai food and the downtown movement in general there is no pride hereafter read all the 5 star rave for this place it was someth of a disappoint for me  arlin b mike c  i drop in for lunch today after come last thursday when they were suppos to be open at 11 am but never open as we wait a while

thi time we wait until 12 to arriv  they were open  our server said yes they should have  open last time at 11

i order the jerk chicken plate which the menu say come with mash potato  broccoli but mine came with a bed of flavor rice under the chicken for side i had the beef dumpl soup  share small order of pof pof  jamaican patti with the others

i thought all the food was ok but loud music play dure most of our visit  this lunch was expens  over 50 for the three of us with just water to drink

i think ocean blue in chandler is a better choic for this kind of food  im pretti sure this was a one visit restaur for me     had lunch here today with arlin b and rand h and i was fire up over this place becaus it averag 5 star well i order the jerk chicken with mash potato and broccoli garnish what i got was jerk chicken with fri rice the jerk chicken was the worst jerk chicken i have had it was white meat chicken done on the grill with a littl jerk season on itit should have been leg and thigh cook over an open flameth rice i had and i am no fan of rice was dri and not veri tast a lot of peopl rave the pof pof ball and i found them to be ok but noth spectacular the onli thing that save them from one star was the jamaican patti were real good but i think they are bought and just heat up so i give this place two star becaus i will not return and i could have had the 5 star buffet at casino arizona for less moneyunfortun fu fu cuisin was more so so cusins for me

i so want to give this small busi owner a higher rate especi after read sever friend review  well my experi was somewhat disappoint when i fellow yelper rand h and mike c this week for lunch  

restaur  veri clean and invit  noth fanci veri basic dinner type of feel  they had the music way too loud for me while tri to enjoy lunch with some friend  

servic  veri nice and friend howev they were not veri attent to our drink  i also had an issu where they over charg me for an ad soup  one person soup was 299 and my soup was 499  i would have been ok with this if my portion was larger than the other but they were the same size  after point it out the server lower the price  

food  everyth was just so so  the dumpl soup was more broth than anyth els  two small dumpl and three small piec of cube goat meat and a 14 ear of corn  i do not recommend this soup  the jerk chicken and rice was veri dri and lack the grill flavor that usual come with caribbean jerk chicken  the pof pof ball were too big and doughi and were more like realli big flour hush puppi  the meat pie was the star of my din experi here

i dont my experi is a one off becaus the yelper that join me experienc the same so so cuisin i hadchicken chees steak with onion pickl pepper good flavor but short on meat fresh soft roll but it a lot of bread when it light on meat good news it someth differ than the neighbor jj bad news was 10 minut later my stomach did a flip from the greas and i spent my even in the bathroom ugh
expens sammich then again we are in north scottsdale
wil i tri them again sure id like to tri the bobbi nexttim around though im not a chainstor fan id rather find the mom  pop shop with real foodok there are two problem with this place  first the food  it is onli ok  the fri are quit good the hamburg are servic  the shake are pretti tasti but not noteworthi  if you go you are go for the fun theme right  the place has a weird vibe  there wasnt much energi or fun happen at least when i was there  
overal ok not great  oh i felt like i had eaten a bag of cement about an hour after drink onli 18 of the shake
oh yeah cash onlii had great expect and was let down this is one of those place you want to visit and check off your list but not necessarili repeat all the time the vibe in the restaur was pretti low the staff seem to just be go through the motion and none of the flair portray in the websit exist within the four wall of the restaur they do not have a fri bar and the nurs do not seem like the one photograph on their advertisement

now onto the food good burger but they could be better if you could order them medium they are all well done or if you could custom the top they fri are veri tasti and their shake look awesom didnt have one this time

on thing that was disappoint they do not accept credit card you have to use their atm if you are not carri ani cash one advic to the ownertak credit cardi saw this place onlin somewher the whole concept is market pretti well

th onli downfallth most import one is that the food suck the onli thing that doesnt suck is the mexican coke with real cane sugar  but heart attack grill doesnt even make the coke so they pretti much just suck 

if the burger actual tast good it would be unhealthi if you ate all of it 
but sinc the burger has no tast and is just a piec of cook meat on a huge bun with a few measli piec of tomato there is noth that would realli make you want to go back 

i had the 12 lb burger and ate the entir burger but didnt eat 12 of the bun  i onli ate the burger becaus i paid for it and i was hungri or els i probabl wouldnt have even eaten it 

the fri are soggi and gross  i dont usual add salt on my food but i had to put salt on these fri to eat them and they were still pretti gross 

i was go to order a milkshak but the milkshak was in such a small cup that there was no justifi the 5 price tag 

the onli novelti in this restaur is the scale outsid the door and the slutti nurs costum that the waitress must wear 

the waitress are friend and the owner is the doctor look man with the stethoscop around his neck 

we came in on friday around 6pm and there were onli 30 or so patron in a room meant for at least 75 they should probabl improv their food and add more item to the  5 item menu or i dont see whi anyon would bother come backi have to say i was not impress with this place at all  it has a good gimmick  when enter there is a huge sign on the door state cash onli and you are remind of this by the nurs who is posit behind  a glass wall she kind remind you that it is cash onli and they have an atm if you need it  all patient must wear a hospit gown 
we were sat near the paddl station but sad posit so we realli couldnt see what was realli happen except the beat  you are beaten if you dont finish your food  in realiti you have to buy one of their souvenir paddl 

it took a bit for our waitress to come over to us to place our order  there realli isnt much varieti on the menu it is a burger or a chili hot dog  i got a singl burger and my husband order the chili dog with fri  the burger was bland even with chili on it and the fri were just soggi not crisp at all  my husband chili dog didnt have enough chili on it to cover the whole thing oh and you cant just order a glass of water you have to pay for bottl water and the coca cola bottl are the smaller kind  pay 3 a pop was not pleasant 

we were entertain while we ate as sever tourist were be spank but all in all the place is not worth a repeat  food was eh servic was eh and the price were ehmarbella was one of those restaur for me that you want to tri but at the same time you werent so sure on pull the trigger by go sudden a livingsoci appear and it seem that i had littl to lose to tri it out

walk in and saw that it was busi coupl everywher if your one of those coupl that like to make fun of the lovey dovey stuff that other do then this is your place to be a creeper the environ is definit not somewher i would eat with my dad especi if they have instrument of love make song play wait a few minut at the hostess stand was not a big deal it either meant they were busi touch tabl or inattent 

dure my experi i had to wait less than 10 minut on a friday night for a tabl not bad the food was okay definit did not experi ani stand out and the same appli to the sangria the poor servic was the predomin flavor of the night had ask if we could upgrad the fri on the ahi tuna way over season and overcook to the marbella fri which we receiv an okay for but ala did not happen the cevich did not blow ani mind edibl and a decent portion size im glad that i had a livingsoci becaus if i had paid full price for what they serv as paella i would be devast a few other dish were order but they slip my mind

i did not see my server too often onli when she brought the menus when she saw i didnt get the fri promot and bill time sometim dure dinner the we were inform of a facebook promot they had which we had an option of get a small plate sangria or a desert the bill howev  show a facebook promot line but had a 0 valu thus be charg for the dessert the server didnt believ me when i had told them they charg me but after a few minut it was corrected

th disconnect from the staff and  non soul reach food tell me ill probabl skip my next opportun to come backthis place wont be here long i came in two night ago becaus the yard hous had a wait it look okay from the outsid besid the 30someth girl dirti danc on eachoth i should have taken this as a warn sign i was eventu greet by a bartend who was hard of hear for the most part he was nicefriend and frank i felt bad for him there was no one at the bar but me unless you count the waitress who laid down on the bartop where i was eat to get a shot done off of her

i order a salad and a soup both were good although there wasnt much meat in my soup togeth they were 1100 which isnt bad 

this place cater to the 20someth colleg guy who in their right mind creat a place like this in a highrent area the hostess were 4s at best and were basic nude the girl were all in bikini top and short  but what the point of shake you booti for no money i felt like they had no respect for themselv it one thing to be a gogo dancer but i doubt ani of those employe walk with more than 100 buck 

wtf part me eat my meal at the bar midway through a waitress lay down on the bartop mayb 3 inch away from me and a group of guy do bodi shot off of her there has to be a heathcod against some chick bodyhair be that close to my food while i am eat there were a bunch of colleg guy take pic of it of cours so i am sure i am on some random dude facebook page look at my meal gross outhonest ani place that check guy for weapon is a no go for me im not realli good around thug and hoodlem was a littl weird

onc insid i saw whi it like tijuana meet southcentr la 
i also do not like to get shank nor check out like a piec of carn asada just saying

th margarita was disgust sweet and bare ani alhoohool with it and it was way to expens sorri i rather go to my favorit hole in the wall mexican restaur than this place at least i wont get shank rob rape check out abduct or touchthere are mani valuabl tip from the review on this festiv i will tri to hit some base left untouched

at one point i was hungri and just want to buy food from the truck we like the best when we pass through the 15 minut line i ask if we could put in a order and pay for it i was told sampl onli total lame that i would have to wait and wait and wait just to feel full

i found a littl pink bbq truck with cinnamon infus sauc on their meat and a veri small line and hit them up a good 5 time over the night to tri and get my food valu out of the night

th two hotdog truck both did a veri good job on both keep food come out to the peopl and custom to keep everyon happy

th dirt atmospher was harsh at time for this reason you would be in line eat some tot and then be hit with a breez of dirt

no tot and dirt please

mani truck ran out of food earli which seem to be unfair to both pay custom and other truck in the area still cranking

if this becom the norm the good truck will bring less food so everyon can relax after a certain hour and the custom will miss out

th live music was fresh but sometim they were play over other music on speaker weaksauce

they need to have a bigger locat becaus the line were out of control and half the battl would be find the right line for truck


i almost gave it 3 star becaus i did have some good food and at 10 when we left we defiant had our money worth twas a decent date night becaus were more on the relax side but i could defiant see mani frustrat peopl just give up after complain the whole time 

let hope they make some key chang for the next onethis place has the potenti to be good howev they keep come up short  i agre with some other comment about the staff  this place doe not have a staff on the a game  c to d at best

to have trust and faith in a place it realli need to start with the person take the order to hit the right key and input your order correct  it not rocket scienc and no one is be rush so to get your order wrong is just a sign of incompet  

we have been here 3 time now and have had bad experi  the first bad experi was the wrong smoothi be made  the second time the smoothi were not made proper  we got close to what we order but the peopl just seem to be too inexperienc  

now the third time they advertis to be hcg and vegan friend howev the chef and owner are not vegan and have not read a vegan cook book  hint hint mayb will help becom more familiar with what you are advertis  this place is still kind of new but you should have a clue befor you make a claim and advertis that you are friend to peopl needs

again the order was put in wrong at the regist which caus the entir experi to go nowher but down which is sad  this place has a lot of potenti as i said in the begin and i would love to see this place succeed if the owner and chef have the abil to tighten up their ship and get thing right  with all the hole in their staff which lead to bad experi by custom ship full of hole onli go in be direct downa of now i cannot give this place ani more then 2 star  we will probabl give hem one last chanc befor we write them off complet i just hope they stay in busi long enough for this to happendisappoint  

this place is smart with their market and ambienc  im just go to give a quick positiveneg feedback

positives

               space it clean and has modern simpl  decor easi to sit and chat for a while
               turkey it real slice turkey not process deli meat

neg 

                 food qualiti im annoy how they come across to everyon they want you to think this is amaz healthi food  not one item on their menu is organ  they also dont have a lot of altern ingredi to choos from they seem to have limit knowledg of glutenfre and vegan food this lead me to the next negative

                 price it is pretti expens  at least 7 dollar for a smoothi and at least 10 dollar for a sandwich  it would be understand if they use organ high qualiti ingredi but no  their ingredi do not cost much at all therefor they are take advantag of peopl  

               environment friend  first of all they dont use real plate they care about health but not environ so they use paper plate  okay at least they quick biodegrad  but wait the utensil are crappi plastic one  what the heck be consist 

overal i serious feel that whoever open this place doe not care about ani of the thing they market  i think they know that be healthi is in and are tri to bank on it  they should be serv organ fruit veggi and meat  they should have a vast work knowledg of other type of food for substitut they should be use real plate and silverwar or use all biodegradablecompost things

and they should not be insult our intellig needless to say im not go back  id rather spend my money on a place that give qualiti food for a normal pricegreat work from the kitchen but epic fail by front of hous if onli that great food hadnt die on the pass 68 minut wait beer arriv cool and flat how long had it been sit there goddamit

it look like yelper zachari v and dan p got it right befor me poor servic sinc at least a few month ago

th french onion burger was wellconceiv and the ingredi were great
perfectlycook mediumrar burger
gruyer on top great choic perfect flavor but alreadi harden and cold
gril onion were juici and not too salty
even the bun was butteri and delicious
tatertot perfect cooked
 too bad it all arriv lukewarm and dead

you know or perhap you dont what dead food tast like if you dont know what that mean think take home a togo bucket of fri chicken with a side bucket of french fri when you arriv home it just fade the fri chicken may still be kind of crispi and slight warm and the fri may be tasti but theyv lost their life theyr dead you go or you should be go to a restaur to tast wellprepar food from fresh highqual ingredi present just moment after cooking

oth suggestions
 redesign your menus beer and alcohol menu read like an index card im use as a cheatsheet for a lecture
 as you present the regular menu explain it to me tell me that the app and featur are on the front and the burger  are on the back talk to me about it and get me excit for what im about to eat dont just drop me and run
 it n octob in phoenix the weather is fantast you gotta know that folk are go to want to find a place to sit and have a great lunch beer and a burger on a great patio how can you not proper staff for a mild busi lunch service
 where are the buser runner and support staff read nowher offload some of this work from the server to let them do their job properly


not there may be a problem with my phone but when i went to check in here and my gps put me on top of the restaur it fell to 24th on the list of nearbi restaur first off i have to prefac this review with im not a huge meat eater so whi did i come here you ask work xmas parti and ive heard a lot of buzz on this place so i thought id give it a tri i was go to just get the salad bar at first but at 22 a person i might as well tri the entir experi for 45 i wasnt impress with the salad bar i think ive had a better select at sweet tomato so that was a letdown then the meat start come and it was like meat overload noth realli was spectacular honest the onli piec of meat i like was the lamb the best part of my experi here was the 3 caipirinha 

for dinner and 3 cocktail my bill was 110 realli not a chanc i would ever go back and spend that again for that kind of money i will go to a restaur on the strip 

i gave one star for servic they were on top of it and anoth star for the food not be bad guess this place just wasnt my thingi feel kind of bad give this place two starsno actual not really

first the kitchen was complet understaf i came in for dinner on sunday night with 3 other and our total dinner time took us almost 2 hour i ask our server to bring everyth out togeth but our dish came individu with about 1015 minut in between we pretti much had no other choic but to share which we do anyway but i want all of our food to come at once

second the server were realli nice but lack communication
exampl my parti had finish our second dish and was wait for our third one of the server came to pick it up and ask if we want ani dessert she was veri polit but where was our food

third there was onli one dish that was good here what we ate

kob beef carpaccio the qualiti of the meat itself was great i wouldv like it if it had been cut a littl thinner though the dish as a whole was a littl inconsist some part had too much or too littl of one thing or anoth the parmigiano reggiano was also a littl too mild for my taste

uni tomato cream spaghetti this dish is that one good dish i was talk about this dish was delight they didnt go cheap on the uni and the uni was fresh the tomato cream was nice and light the spaghetti was perfect al dente

kurobuta tonkatsu the sauc was wateri and bland the meat itself need more season as well i like that they put chees insid of it but this dish was a complet fail veri disappoint see how this dish was featur in one of their articles

fettuccin prosciutto carbonara i liter had to forc this down i was the most unhappi with this dish becaus it took the longest and tast the worst the pasta was undercook and tast like it had been boil in unsalt water the sauc had no flavor the onli thing ok about this dish was the prosciutto the chef obvious didnt tast this dish when hesh sent it out of the kitchen my boyfriend who isnt a foodi said i couldv made someth better than this and as much as i love him his cook isnot as good as most other peopl ive met 

i am veri unhappi with my experi at this restaur i was realli excit when i look this place up and my mouth start water when i saw the photo and read the review i wish i couldv had as good of an experi as all the other yelper i guess it was just a bad day for this place but you know what consist is one of the most import thing in a success restaurant

that is all i have to sayalright phoenix it time to stop lose your collect shit over smashburg ill probabl get crucifi for say this but doe anyon els out there feel like theyr eat mcdonald when theyr have a smashburger

now dont get me wrong mcdonald isnt quit as greasi or salti tast as smashburg but the two still are veri similar oh except one thing mcdonald fri are way better everi time ive had fri from smashblah they are over fri make them too stiff and tasteless plus this place is way over price so i guess that two differences

put it this way if delux or rocket burger were next door to smashburg then 10 time outta 10 im pass by smashburg and go to the other place  now if mcdonald was right next door to smashburgeryeah id probabl still skip smashburg and save my moneyslow and rude onli give them two star becaus the outdoor seat is love and their gelato was pretti good other than that this place is a onestar establish my fiancé and i came to gc while visit my brother and his famili i live in la jolla and my fiancé live in los angel and there is no reason at all that the servic at a place of this calib or ani calib realli should be much ruder than anywher in san diego or la second it was so unbeliev slow our breakfast burrito took over 30 minut mayb even over 40 and it was mediocr at best as were our drink blahenjoy this place 4 star worth on grand open day near a year and a half ago but it taken me a while to get back over here as it a 26mile drive each way

today the food choic were somewhat the same as they are on day one except that they were down to 108 item this time plus sauc  dress from 130 at the start  there were some thing to prais about the place today such as lot of shrimp dish includ stuf shrimp bacon wrap shrimp salt  pepper shrimp and ceviché and for dessert there were four kind of real ice cream chill to the right temperatur not so cold that you cant scoop it

th problem today that cost them two star were these

  a lot of the food that should have been hot was either lukewarm or wors room temperatur  not ok     o

  there was a nasti smell in the place  not all over but i pick up a whiff of it here and there in the serv area  the men room had an odor about it too although it look clean  no it wasnt pine sol although i think that stink too  whatev these smell are they need to find them  get rid of them     o

  they have a littl sushi  also a mongolian style bbq with 4 meat but neither were anywher near as good as what i have just had twice in the last few day over at the new china oliv in sun citi for example

sorri it onli 2 star this time     

weekday lunch buffet  799719 srtri this joint from all the review  crust was horribl owner should order dough from the peopl that suppli papa john i will not be back to this place  the chees and sauc were realli good can tell the qualiti of the chees i like either lisanti or grand moz chees  my issu is with the dough  fix the dough and this can be a great place

71012

i tri this place again main becaus i want to give them a chanc  i hate give a bad review to busi owner who are tri hard to put out good food and are tri to make a live  the dough was the same  seem to lack gluten i have made dough in the past and i thought the dough we produc gave us a great crust that most of us are look for  unfortun i do not like this dough if they use my dough and the ingredi they use this place would be the best in n las vega  lisanti high gluten pizza dough is what we use just say hope this yelpi realli want to like pizza n green  i was just about readi to give them four star but then  okay let me tell you the whole story

mi wife and i walk in to this empti pizza place hope for lunch befor a movi  we are greet by a friend gentleman readi to heap servic upon us like nobodi busi  we order our food and drink everyth seem fine  the pizza was veri sauci and actual pretti good  as this restaur appear to be halal none of the meat have pork in them  thus you get turkey sausag  that was fine with me

halfway through our meal some folk came innot to eat but to chat with the owner  he then went into chat mode at one point sit down with his back to us to chew the fat for an extend period  goodby servic  he just stop pay attent to us completely

mi messag to the owner of pizza n green  when you own a busi and in particular a restaur busi the custom come first  sit down and chat with your friend while you have custom in the store is not a good idea  even if you are go to do that at least give your patron the highest prioriti  if i did what you did as a waiter for most restaur i would probabl get fired

oh yeahalso when a custom flag you down and final get your attent be sure that when you refil a custom drink you fill it all the way  a refil doe not mean that you give back the cup twothird full  how much money in soda syrup are you realli saving

a i said befor i realli want to give these folk more star but the servic turn me off  i like the pizza and the price wasnt bad at all but when the owner give chit chat  with his bud a higher prioriti than a pay custom it make me think that i should be go elsewher the next time i want a pieinca is a veri frustrat restaur  from the moment you step through the door you want it to be veri good  like a beauti woman inca keep throw out hint that it is someth special but it seldom live up to it promises

you drive up to a small restaur in a larg outdoor shop mall and you think this is go to be a neighborhood dine experi  then you open the door and notic that the dine area is clean and attract and there are qualiti tablecloth and nice chair  so you revis your think this is go to be a fine dine experi  then you see the huge bar stock with the peruvian pisco liquor and almost noth els and the big screen tvs show sport event  now you dont know what to think

they give you a small bowl of roast corn  and it delici  the menu look classi and the price are consist with a fine dine establish  your mouth start to water  everyth sound good but eventu you decid and give the waiter your order  in our case this was one appetis and two main cours  a minut later he return  he forgot the order  then you wait  other tabl get their food and it look delici  you are a bit frustrat becaus the roast corn is gone and you havent gotten your appetis and your hungri but it will be worth it  right

wrong  our appetis final came 35 minut after order  we order a beef tamal  our server brought it but inform us that they dont have beef tamal  this one is chicken  it turn out that it didnt matter  there was liter one piec of chicken the size of an oliv and about a teaspoon of a mixtur that could have been onion and tomato  the rest was corn masa  you might be a bit disappoint  we were but we gave it a tast  it was veri good  but it was just corn meal  after a few byte we despar want that chicken or inde ani savori fill  how frustrating

f minut after the appetis the main cours arriv  appar the chef believ in total finish one ticket befor start the next  it make for a veri poor pace meal  we were realli hope for someth tasti  mine was a minc beef dish serv between two slab of white rice  sort of a picadillo sandwich  the beef fill was tasti and a perfect foil for the rice  too bad there was so lilttl of it  i end up frustrat again  this could have been realli good if they had serv enough beef fill  as it was i ate rice for dinner  my wife had the lamb shank  it was an averag size portion but veri fatti and not well prepar  almost ined  the bean were bland  the fri yucca was starchi it need spice and more fri time

oth have complain about the price but these are reason for a fine dine establish  too bad the dine isnt fine  my advic to the owner  i know everi restaur want to keep their food cost down to around 25 but you have cut your to about 6 and that just wont do  your food most has great potenti if you would onli serv some of itsorrycan onli give this place 2 star we went at night and the 1st thing we notic was the cold hard white  uninvit  light ugh terribl light in there it was like street light ligh or like warehous lightingwa not appropri for a dine place at all  
the waiter inform us that they were out of 3 thing on the menu that a bad sign right there i order the bbq chicken sandwich with a side of cole slaw
th sauc  the shred chicken came separateyou had to pour in the sauc on the chicken  at honey bear it alreadi mix in which i feel is better that way
th chicken wasnt realli that warm luke warm at most and that goe for the sauc too plus i thought the sauc was on the bland side it was miss flavor  the cole slaw was the same waybland  honey bear is far better their sauc is kickass it has a kick
also the sound acoust were aw in there there were onli about  8 peopl dine but it sound like there were 40 peopl 
also i spot an employe eat food in the kitchen i dont think that custom should be see that happening
on more thing the restroom smell absolut horribl like a sewer in there 
sorri for all of the complaint but i am just tell you what happen on my visit there we will most like not return here  honey bear bbq is way betterbefor go we call and the hostess let us know about happi hour half off beer and pizza from 4 til 6 i also check onlin for their happi hour which also state the same thing upon receiv the bill onli the draft beer were discount i ask the waiter and he was shock he ask the hostess and the owner who was there and they said they never said or heard anyth at this time we show the owner and waiter the websit state the discount  to make thing wors the waiter give us 15 off then when the owner find out he take it off charg us full price he came over to tell us we were wrong and he was right he then went to argu at anoth tabl that had present a coupon  no sorri no noth the waiter was the onli bright spotthis place is salt in the wound from one of my favorit local restaur close last year it basic the fast food version of the same thing 

the concept is a good one salad soup sandwich i welcom fresh healthi option but be warn if you order a larg salad youll get the exact same quantiti of mixin than you would in a small salad  just extra lettuc now let think about that it just dilut the impact those mixin have i find that a bummer

if that chang i would probabl bump up my review becaus i do love the concept and i think the italian soda mixer station is a rad idea and i love that their version of the dinner mint is a chocol cover strawberrii usual like to start off my review with the posit so here it goe 
valu is definit the highlight of this place as there some realli good deal on select day i think it 299 burrito on monday free churro on tuesday and kid eat free on sunday im sure there are other daili special but i cant rememb all of them they also have a good salsa bar with pico onion cilantro pepper and a few differ type of salsa depend on the hot level food was like okay i wouldnt saliv or dream about it or anyth 

now to the part that kind of made me cringesanit  i went to bathroom and they ran out of soap actual they didnt even have a soap cartridg insid the dispens also the hygien of ppl serv food was a littl bit question exampl the dude put on glove good but then with the same glove he touch the food bill and the cash regist without chang them onc now that is just disgust 

let me say this befor peopl think im be too harsh ive had street food in mexico vietnam korea phillippin and indonesia if you ever had street food in those countri then you know damn well you may be risk some unfavor bowel movement later im not be picki but i just dont want to get food poison and throw up for a good 2 day straight that is alloh don your hang on by the thinnest littl thread a few year back this would have been 5 glow star what happened

i mean i know a lot happen you open then you close then you open under a differ name in a new locat then you open back up in the old locat but the most import thing is your back and we were excit that you were back you were the best you offer great food at a decent price servic was never your fort but it was at least bearabl we brought peopl from mani mile away to your restaur becaus you were that good on a lazi saturday night we order your food and rent a movi and consid it a perfect night on father day we brought pop by to enjoy the lunch special becaus that what he wantedbut thing have changed

so we came back after so mani year of loyalti there was no doubt that wed be back in the interim we hit up mama ds and the food was great tast just like don this time around in the old but new venu we order our tradit favorit 1 on the list was the fettuccin carbonara back then the sauc was better than some of the finer dine option in this citi so the excit to eat this bowl of awesom was brew my frown was not turn upsid down though it was bad bad in near everi possibl way the sauc was flat tast noth like the olden day the bread prior to the meal becam tasteless breadstick gone are the day of oil  vinegar at the tabl the meatbal calzon we order had 6xs the amount of ricotta chees to the mozzarella that was in there the servic was bad it took a while to get a drink order in then anoth 15 minut to get salad then anoth 30 minut to get entre this was on a friday night when the place wasnt even a 14 full 

someth has chang the meal felt effortless and that more than anyth is what bother me most i dont know if the challeng way of today economi has gotten the best of ol don antonio and his famous recip or if a new chef was hire or what the heck happen but whatev it is i want the old don antonio back and i want it now do it right or dont do it at all this should be a one star review but don has some street cred with me i hope don antonio return to it old glori otherwis this guy is ride off into the sunset never to return againok ive been here twice and i have to give this mexican modern restaur an a for ambienc  they have clear taken care to realli focus on the decor detail  the food unfortun is anoth matter entir  dinner portion are tapa style which i believ is just an excus for them to present excruci small portion at uncomfort high price point  i order  the pulpo which was beauti present but short on flavor  the chicken taco were likewis beauti present but were virtual absent of ani actual chicken  each small corn tortilla was cover in a mound which consist almost entir of a red mole type sauc which had a singl note flavor and drown out all the other ingredi  my dinner companion order a tamal which came out in a modern deconstruct style but portion size was again an issu  this tamal was certain no more than a third of the size of a normal tamal and the ingredi were also drown in mole sauc make it a one note experi  includ tax and tip 26 for two miniscul dish is simpli too high a price to pay regardless of cute decor  not sure about the long term prospect of this establish and given the histori of this particular locat and the abund of dine choic in old town they realli need to bring their a game in order to succeed

anoth disappoint review below wonder whi she didnt stroll over to the mission which for the same price point would have provid a far heartier meal  i would have to agre that for a complet dine experi includ creativ and flavor latin cuisin the mission is a far superior optioni feel like im in the minor but i wasnt realli wow by this place a small group of cowork want mexican for dinner this was near our offic so here we went you have to valet your car which is kind of annoy but the guy were nice and the insid where the restaur is pretti impress decor wise so i was in a good mood 

onc our group trickl in we order some drink and i use my checkin deal to get free chip  guac for the tabl i had the pineappl margarita which was delici but a littl on the small side the rest of the tabl got differ type of margarita and all seem to enjoy them the waiter came out and explain that it a tapa style restaur probabl wouldnt have pick this place had i known that 814plate is pretti steep imho and so we all decid on what we would order if i rememb correct we had the

taco de mahi mahi  didnt tri these but heard they were good 

taco de camaron  didnt tri no complaints

taco de pollo  i enjoy these though i wish the tortilla were a littl bigger for all of the thing they cram onto them

tamal  i realli like this has a bit of a kick to it

pollo ahumado a la yucateco  alright im not a fan of sweet poultri i guess but everyon els like it 

chip  salsa  veri good

about halfway through i order a michelada due to my ignor and the mislead descript on the menu modelo especi lime spice salt i didnt know i was order the grossest drink in the world my fault and i just drank the rest of the modelo out of the bottl but i was surpris no one ask me about it there was also a fli in it but as i was with cowork i didnt want to caus a scene over it my fault lesson learn anoth slight annoy thing is that the glass window on the side of the build slide open which is actual pretti cool but the one or two time they did this to get out to the patio they let fli in which were buzz around our tabl nonstop the server saw us bat them away but no one offer a slight sorri about that all in all 5 dish and 7 drink ran us about 150 if these were main dish id be indiffer but for the valu of what you pay for vs what you get i cant recommend distritodistrito all i am realli gonna say is that as good as the food was there is no way that it could ever make up for how terribl the servic was we went for brunch on sunday and after we were seat i check in on yelp and was given a free guacamol appet for check in i was happi about that and unfortun that would be the last good thing that happen at this place let me say that while we were there it was not busi at all first we order our drink i had a coke and she had the bottomless bloodi mari then i order the free guacamol thank to yelp for our plate i order the skillet and she order the pazol verd the waiter brought back our drink and that was the last time we seen him until he brought our bill someon els brought out our plate about a half hour after we order  but we hadnt receiv our guacamol yet we ask him if he could get us anoth bloodi mari and he left never to be seen again we had to actual go insid and find someon to get a refil for my coke and the bloodi mari then we ask about the guacamol again and they final brought it out when we were done eat overal i enjoy the food but the servic was so terribl i would never go backa colleagu recommend distrito as a good spot for my husband and i to have dinner while in town for busi we were excit to tri it as i love to eat and it had a reput as be a bit trendy

when we walk in i was super excit to see the decor a gumbal wall glitter top tabl and other fun touch it realli a sight to behold we chose to sit outsid sinc it was a beauti night

upon our server recommend we order a coupl drink and some guacamol then we order the tuna cevich a few taco the corn crema and a few other thing the tast of the tuna cevich was quit good as was the corn the rest of the food was frank underwhelm 

the worst part of the night was the servic our server effici took our order howev a runner deliv our food we never saw anyon again not to check on our food and we could never find anyon to ask for our check final we ask anoth server for our check our server apolog profus and admit that he had forgotten about us we accept his apolog and it doe happen but they were not busi at all 

we were veri disappoint in our experifor those of you who have written good review about jasmin tokyo  youv got to be kid  although the dine area is comfort and clean and the peopl who clean your tabl are friend and attent there is a big problem  the food

i dont know what good a larg select of sushi doe you if it isnt veri good  of the eight type i sampl one was decent crispi onion tuna despit have onli a tini morsel of fish  the other seven were fair  a big problem is that even at 6pm when thing should be realli fresh they werent

th tempura was veri oili the nonfish dish orang chicken chicken with mushroom broccoli beef were nowher near as tasti as those you get at a shop center food court  and how did jasmin tokyo manag to make roast duck with skin that was crispi and chewi at the same time  ill tell you how  it had been sit around for hours

season is not a talent of the food prepar i will not call them chef  the spici tuna was not spici noth had salt or other condiment that i could discern and so on and so on and so on

dont save your appetit for desert  it is pedestrian at best and has noth to do with the orient

a few thing were okay name those where good ingredi and decent recip are all that is need  the plain shrimp the custard the hot and sour soup  that about it

22 for this even with 20 off it still at least 10 overpri dont know what happen but i had a total differ experi at rollin smoke then everyon els seem to have had  we order rib tip link mac n chees mash potato potato salad coleslaw peach cobbler and caramel cake all to go  it took over 45 min for our order to be readi  i would think the side and dessert are alreadi prepar and just need to scoop in a contain  so the wait was for link and rib tip  the smoker were not on when we were there so we werent wait for meat  

custom servic could have been friendlier  they custom in front of me ask what side they had and the guy take order just hit the menu where the side were list  i want a link and side but was told i had to get the hotlink sandwich  i ask so i cant just get a link  he said no not realli  when i press the issu he said i can get a 2 item combo and just get all hotlink  i order that but whi not just sell a link for 3 or 4 buck  after 40 min of wait and see peopl order after me get their food i ask how long it would be and was told veri gruffli that they are veri busi  they were busi but i order befor the lunch rush start  i was also sit in the booth next to the regist so i could hear the order and knew who was pick up phone order etc  also dure the 45 min i wait at least 5 peopl told him the coke was out  it was still out when i left  

ok  on to the most import part the food  caus realli i will wait for hour and put up with bad servic for some awesom bbq  

sweet tea not good  i actual switch to soda and i rare drink soda  

rib tip hubbi thought they were ok  im not a big beef rib person but thought they were ok also  

link no way that was 2 portion of link from my 2 meat combo  it wasnt even 1 small link total  but that is ok sinc they were so dri out it look like they were day old  i have never seen meat that dri in my entir life  im be generous to say they look like they were slice the day befor and left in the warmer overnight  

mac n chees veri bland noodl overcook could have use salt or real chees  

mash potato  instant  yes they use instant potato  all the other stuff there is good  if they would use real potato it would probabl be amaz  

potato salad this was the best out of all the side  it was ok but wouldnt order it again  

coleslaw ok  

peach cobbler cold  who serv cold peach cobbler  again ok  not great  

caramel cake yellow cake top with caramel syrup like the kind you buy for sunda  this was actual not bad  i might even tri it at home  

all the side seem just a littl spice away from be good  mayb i went on an off day  i dont know  after read everyon review i was so excit to come here and had high hope for what i thought was go be my new favorit bbq place  i was heartbroken at how bad it was  at some point i will tri again caus these 5 star review have to mean someth  but im gonna need my yelper to go with me caus hubbi isnt have itsalsa was old and fermentedmad me sick to my stomach seriously

lunch portion were veri skimpi  food was noth better than averag 

was veri let down by this place  how it get such good review blow my mindive been debat about write this review  i love cupcak and i was so excit when i so this store  the store insid the mall is veri cute  the staff is amic but not over help  which is ok the cupcak look good howev look are not all even for cupcak  i got the lemon raspberri and the coconut as well as a key lime cake pop  i tri the cake pop first  it was gummi tast and neon green  i have been to key west and i never saw a neon green key lime  then i took a bite out of the coconut one  the cake per se was not bad howev the frost tast like oil  not appet  so i close the littl contain and tri the lemon raspberri  i guess i have been spoil by other cupcak in town  again the neon yellow color for the cake  where do they get these citrus see pictur  the cake tast like the one from the groceri store  i end up throw them in my garbag make sure to smoosh it down in case i had a miranda moment onli if you have watch sex and the citi you will get this  at least i know i wont be tempt at the mall anymor  i guess i should be thanki would like to start by say all three of these star are for the locat and the view not for the servic or food 

we arrang to have a tabl on the patio through kelli the bachelorett coordin and request a specif tabl she made it happen we had the best tabl in the hous dead center right over the lake this was aweom i just wish that was all we had done 

we had set up for a prefix menu of small plate and app our waitress seem to have no idea of this onc she was made awar we all had one of their signatur drink ugh i would not recommend them i had a mango jalapeño drink seem hard to mess up that killer duo basic it was just mango juic i couldnt tast the jalapeno bitter or alcohol when i said i couldnt tast ani alcohol she took it to the bar and came back and said well they said it was the standard pour realli help thank this is just bad custom servic serious just add a splash and make the custom happi there were 5 of us no one like their drink 

the appet were ok at best the best thing we had was littl capres crustini or someth like that that was pretti good but noth els was too great we were suppos to get churro with our menu she said she was put the order in they never came honest our waitress was pretti terribl i will not be go back here they need to step up the game to keep up with the other awesom restaur in vega 

save your money and go somewher elscame in here to meet up with friend live metal band with a horror theme insid as their decor and full of peopl dress in black in graphic metal band tee it was a saturday night and the band was rock it and i was actual enjoy it until to the point when i want to order drinks

worst ef experi in my life me and my buddi wait at the bar make eye contact on the onli two bar tender work on a saturday night wtf im wave yell and wait and still no attemp to come where i was at it came to a point where a stranger had to interven and yell at the bartend that i need to be serv so she came look all unpleas and not realli give a damn or work for tip guess what it a rariti that i dont tip becaus of bad servic but this one was not worth even a measli dollar

w over to the area to shoot some pool roomi kick my ass and so i had to buy the next round of beer  wave down a server after she just serv the peopl near us and ask for two budlight she said yea but never came back search her out to see if she complet forgot becaus it was a busi night but she was just there watch the band and smoke realli i hate to bring race into this but it seem like i was be ignor becaus of the way i was dress and ethnic  i didnt fit in at all the major were white with metal band style attir and here i am dress like an averag joe and the onli filipino in the place 

this was was go to be a 4 star the first 10 min but servic just kill it afterif you advertis ayc korean bbq you should have the general decenc to bring out more than one order of galbi at a time for a parti of six we would order 2 galbi and 1 brisket and would receiv 1 galbi and 1 brisket we would then order 2 galbi and 1 ribey and would receiv 1 galbi and 1 ribey the game becam predict and frustrat repeat 6 or 7 time and you begin to think that there a big sign in the back in korean that say onli one order of our precious galbi per tabl per half hour or your fire at leas that how it felt to top it off there is a warn on the bottom of the menu that threaten a 25 penalti if more than a 12 lb of meat is left on your tabl see this warn was beyond ridicul and iron as at no point was more than a 12 lb of meat serv to us at ani given time

th servic was typic la  nyc which mean it was pretti much terribl and the waitress will actual talk shit about you in korean under their breath i saw  heard this sever time especi when we tri to manipul the temperatur of our grill we had to get the attent of the manag might have been the owner wife to prod our waitress into fill our 6 empti beverag glass and our empti banchan dish at one point we found a sweet spot by order with what appear to be a server assist he brought us the 2 galbi and 1 whatev that we order a few time in a row and we felt like we hit the jackpot  sound sad doesnt it in the end we order about 9 plate of assort meat for an averag of 3 serv per person at our tabl or about 12 oz per person grill off the fat and that about 8 oz of 5lb short rib plus some random banchan and soup for 25 not a veri good valu not to mention it took 3 hour to pri that much from them this place make sura bbq buffet look like an oasis

qu of food and woonam jung retrospect almost exact one year ago this place open with a fullpric a la cart menu the 28 singl serv of galbi were some of the most expens in town but absolut the most tender delici korean marin short rib ive ever tast worth everi penni this legendari galbi doe not exist anymor at woonam jung total bait and switch dont even think your get the same qualiti with the new and stingi ayc plan to make matter wors the banchan they serv is below averag which is surpris becaus youd think that it should be at least better than the stuff avail at the greenland korean market next door i cant imagin that the owner of this restaur actual eat the same grade food as their ayc customers

you guy are be cheapo the vent hood werent turn up to an accept level keep our friend against the wall in a wall of smoke the entir meal and a tabl for 6 at a truli lastyl kbbq should have a larger grill than the littl circl one at woonam jung ok enough 2 star and i am out for gooddo not be fool by the name  all of these hibachi grill  suprem boofay pop up around town are under differ ownership with quit differ recip come from the kitchens

thi locat claim to be the largest in the valley but it must mean sq footag or someth becaus the select was lack there seem to be a ton of food tray it just that noth veri good was in them  a lot of repetet dish a lot of starchi  fillerupp 

way too much nonchines food  if i want hot dog kelbasa chicken nugget etc id go to old timer boofay not a china boofay

everyth in the place seem to have an oili sheen from it time spent cook in the deep fryer sinc this seem to be the onli way anyth is prepared

th entri way is impress look and if your not realli pay much attent you may get beguil by the flashi light and clank knive of the live sushi and hibachi chef but do not be fooled

thi is americhino fare at it most mediocr and not worth the price they chargnot one of the better subway ive been to it is open 24 hour howev they need more then 1 guy work this guy seem like it he knew noth about the sandwich or how to work the regist right it took almost 20 minut to get a sandwich with onli 1 person ahead of me i had a cold cut combo and it was suppos to be 5 yet when i got to my car and look at the receipt he charg me 525 instead it not like the extra quarter broke the bake it just that the guy was lost the fill on my sub were great but the bread was crunchi and hard i got some oatmeal cooki they were soft and good i might give this subway a shot at a later date sinc i shop at the nearbi walli world and sinc they are open 24 hourno no no this place is all wrong 45 star really

1 star for their awesom drive thru 1 star for their awesom servic and that where the star stop 

i hate my pho wait im sorri hate is a strong word i dislik my pho a lot it had a sweet broth and was just all wrong sure they give you a big portion for about 7 but as we all over use this phrase qualiti over quantiti i got the rare steak and brisket pho and my brisket was so fatti it was more like flank than brisket i tri to spice my broth with basil sriracha lime juic anyth that would alter the broth a littl but it just didnt work sheer disappoint i had bite from my girlfriend vermicelli and crispi noodl and noth spark my girlfriend crispi noodl with gravi was so salti i couldnt even go in for a second bite whi this place is rate so high beat me they were so high prais at the nail salon we were get our nail done at earlier that day so we thought these asian have to know what up nope they definit steer us wrongive given this restaur two tri and will not return for a third if you like scarciti in term of decor and especi food this is your place if howev you eat more than say a new york citi runway model get readi for fashion week then avoid attempt to eat here

th first time i tri the italian restaur name with such appar lack of energi it foreshadow the experi i order a mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich which was ok but noth fabul the portion was small but not ridicul so and came with a small pile of plain leafi green toss in oliv oil the sandwich consist of a hard crust bread slice of mozzarella and paper thin slice of prosciutto  simpl plain and fair bland  i left unsatisfi but not angry

not a great first tri but im a fan of italian food and so love spasso that occupi this locat prior to the italian restaur i decid to give it anoth shot  think that mayb i should move to the pasta section of the one page menu that this is where the italian in the restaur would shine through i order the ravioli special  it was simpli put underwhelm  there were 6 i count squar ravioli that were no bigger than the width of a typic fork  look at the meager portion i thought wow these must be incred  at 12 for the dish 2 a ravioli should be amaz  surpris and unfortun this was definit not the case  they were again bland and top with a simpl bland tomato sauc  the size of this lunch dish was about what id expect for a tapa or a small appet  im a big fan of smaller portion and higher qualiti but it realli hard for me to believ this was a serious attempt at a lunch portion for anyone

bottom line i left hungri disappoint to the point of feel angri at be rippedoff and determin never to returni had some time to kill befor my flight out of the phoenix airport so i decid to tri out the breakfast sandwich at great steak  i had the beef egg sandwich which was actual realli good  it pretti much a philli chees steak sandwich with egg on a smaller round bun my complaint about this main about the worker who was behind the counter cook it was about 958am when i step up to order i think at 10am they stop serv breakfast and he kept complain to the order taker to stop take breakfast order the way he was whine and talk veri loud not onli held up the line but made the custom uncomfort  he kept say shes the last one she can order a sandwich but no potato the other ladi work behind the counter said it was fine i can order potato to go with my sandwich the girl behind me want breakfast too and the cook guy kept say that she definit has to be the last one i dont understand how breakfast could end so abrupt and im onli allow to order the sandwich and not the combo  the guy was rude and he may have been get off shift becaus when i look up again it was someon els cooking

it unfortun becaus insid an airport you onli have so mani option i wish the airport has some sort of say with the busi insid so that travel can have a good experi as a wholestop in here for lunch today join by robyn n

the good

  it a nice stylish place with comfort booth seat as well as tables

  the price was ok  my 3 combo was 949  includ two meat choic corn on the cob two side bread  a drink  i had the moist slice brisket smoke sausag potato salad  smokin joe bake bean for side plus their jalepeño corn bread muffin  helpyourself lemonade

th notsogood

  there were three peopl do the serv plus a cashier  the cashier gal was friend the side server gal was ok but both of the guy in the meat serv area struck me as kind of snarky

  the food was blah     o

th corn on the cob wasnt barbecu the brisket was lean  tender but didnt have much flavor  both the potato salad and the bake bean were pretti noth as well

sorri i think rudi bbq right across the street is much betterthis place was start by the former ceo of hooter which is not at all surpris i guess he figur that scantili clad server with enhanc boob is a concept that cant fail as long as there are men in this world and mayb hed be right if it was locat in an area that didnt have so mani other place that offer equal attract server better atmospher and better food 

unfortun it just feel like twin peak is tri too hard while the waitress are attract i didnt see ani real effort be made by them to interact with the client the food while better than hooter is noth special and my order of fish taco came out of the kitchen far too fast to have been made from scratch which lead me to believ that the food is prepar elsewher and like just warm up or microwav at the restaur 

final the atmospher is suppos to be like a hunt  fish lodg but with such a giant build it realli felt more like a warehous with some outdoor memorabilia stuck to the wall 

mayb im wrong and the chain will be a huge success but i just wasnt impress with all the competit in the market twin peak realli doesnt differenti itself in ani meaning wayin the interest of full disclosur i got a messag from the owner of hometown classic american eat via yelp ask me to give them a tri my first attempt to do so was on monday but they were close so i went back yesterday and decid to tri them for lunch 

park despit be at the corner of lake mead and water st is not bad if the laundri and cstore next door are not busi onc you step insid youll find a place that decor in a mix of countri kitsch and 50s diner style there was a tv on the west wall play classic movi to watch while you wait to give your order 

the servic here come with a smile and is veri help but right off the bat i found a misprint on their menuboard they dont have roast chicken sandwich but they did have turkey sandwich and you get a choic of bread white wheat rye or sourdough i chose sourdough and ad fri and ice tea 

i had a seat on the hard eat it and beat it style seat and wait onc my food arriv i snap a pictur of it with the yelp app and then gave it a tri the sandwich was hohum it wasnt bad but it wasnt great either the fri stole the show and if it wasnt for them i would have left hungri the tea was kind of flat but after order it and see the lipton label i lower my expect on it mayb my tast was off but it didnt tast good and sugar didnt make it better 

i end up leav slight hungri so i went up the street to chef flem bake shop to kind of balanc out my experi a 5 star european bakeri make ani day better and while there i told them what happen the staff there said they had good luck with the hot sandwich in particular the french dip and the breakfast plate i trust their opinion so with that in mind im go to have to give hometown classic american eat a second tri but the first impress was not good at allnormal my famili is particular about stick to the tri and true chines restaur it is rare to get my mom and dad to deviat from their regular rotat when my dad suggest this place it took me by surpris the yelper in me is alway in search of a hidden gem

hk garden is not that kind of place it is jam pack with tabl of scream uncontrol children the asian teacher in me want to expel some corpor punish but decid against it a few stern look were enough to get them into the seat next to their mother 

the servic is lack of cours it is lack it is a chines restaur of cours i am go to get ignor when i need them most 

the food is a hit or a miss 

the seafood and tofu hot pot hit 
the mapo tofu miss
th pork blood and intestin hot pot hit
th hk sweet and sour spare rib miss
th whole fri flounder hit

appar if 40 is spent you get a free entre we got the flounder there is someth els for 80the skinni  poor control of season mar what ought to have been a decent burger 2 servic is okay but the ambienc suck becaus it is open air next to a bunch of slot machin  the continu noxious wave of smoke hover over us as we tri to eat 2 valu given all the great burger joint in the valley this one deserv a skip 2

we came here after work one night to check out this place out 
 
mi hubbi was the eye the truffl fri fri zucchini stick and the imperi burger i was just look for a good caesar salad 

the ambienc is sever lack the fact that the restaur is not cordon off from the main casino floor make for a smoki unpleas experi if you dont like smoke i would suggest you attempt to be seat as far away from the slot machin as possible

servic was okay  our server brought out our meal in a reason time and kept our water glass fill most of the time

th food was just not that good consid the amount we paid for it i just wasnt impress by anyth we order some of the idea were good howev the poor execut realli prevent ani food from be even halfway good

th coat of the fri zucchini stick was over thick and seem to slough off the zucchini too easili as well the zucchini itself was veri salti the truffl fri although ampl truffl flavor lack the proper textur  not enough crispi to it the imperi burger had noth imperi about it bland brais tough short rib and flavorless caramel onion grace the under season beef patti the caesar salad was pretti generic and i wouldnt get it again

overal there realli isnt a compel reason to recommend or return to this establishthis is lola coffe with a new a new sign and ruder peopl  my coffe was aw  thank good is was just an espresso shot so the pain was short live  i felt i was take medicin  the place has not chang much  it could have potenti but i dont need to come backi final tri the spot this afternoon when i had some time to kill befor work it just across the street from me and ive been want to tri it sinc it open up last month

a other review have said the place is veri small and awkward arrang there was onli two other peopl in line while i was there but i still had to manuev around them to get water from the soda fountain the two tabl downstair were alreadi occupi by a dad and son in one and an employe in anoth whi is an employe take a tabl away from a custom shouldnt they be provid a break room or at least eat outside

i got the veggi sandwich and it was sorta good sorta bad the bad part was the soggi hoagi roll that it was serv on it couldnt stand up to the fill and after a few bite i had to eat it with a fork i love how generous they were with the avocado that a big plus for me the babi portobello were cook perfect not slimi or underdon but they could have use more season the side salad includ with the sandwich was bad it was iceburg lettuc ew ew ew tomato and cucumb dress with some sick sweet vinaigrett  im not sure whi custom arent given the choic of side fri or salad instead it determin by the sandwich you order

i was hope to fit the spot into my rotat of neighborhood restaur sinc it within walk distanc but it not good enough to sway me away from the coffe shop or joe farm grill not even closei mayb the onli person in vega who doesnt care for this restaur i know it been around forev i know it super cheap but it just a diner with old peopl in it lmao p

the food is super basic howev the steak and egg is the best thing on the menu and onli 599 

the home brew are good my favorit was their ipa howev i thought it could use a bit more hopi realli dont know whi this place is get 5s im realli reluct to give out too mani 5s becaus a 5 star to me is top notch stuff this place is super hype there noth realli special about this place other than a few special roll that dont pack much of a punch

seawe salad 35 theyr seawe salad is prepar a bit differ tast the same though as most place i think this place love sauc i hate thing be over sauc their seawe salad came with a drizzl of a yellow sauc on top of it it made no differ to the flavor tast like a normal seawe salad a littl more wateri than usual 

their version of poke 25 wasnt impress i was veri disappoint that they didnt have an ahi poke everi place has this instead they had a spanish version of poke it was like tuna with salsa on top of a chip

da roll 15 im not much into deep fri roll so this wasnt someth i order they mistaken brought it to my tabl but sinc we had ayc we didnt mind eat it 

sashimi roll 45 the onli special thing i kind of like on the menu i was blown away when yelper said there was a sushi spot that made sashimi roll i had to tri it basic it your assort fish wrap with a thin slice of radish the radish add an odd flavor to the sashimi that make the roll a bit sour and yucki 

nigiri 45 probabl the onli good thing about this place the ratio of fish to rice was just perfect 5050 yet we all know more fish than rice is what we realli want the fish was realli fresh too the salmon nigiri came with thin slice 

tuna carpaccio05 ekk over sauc the thin slice of tuna were super thin and it was drench with sauc the caramel toast garlic ad an eeri flavor the tuna carpaccio i absolut hate it 

bake green mussel 45 the bake green mussel were delici not as sweet as order and it was cut into 3 piec than your usual 2 piec unfortun it 1 order person which make it limit 

ayc 35 is limit all you can eat is suppos to be all you can eat but here it seem like more than 10 item are limit to one order per person i dont like that i hate limit lol

overal doubt ill come here again the sushi was eh okay wasnt amazi would like to formal prefac this review by announc that my love for jimmi john is onli eclips by the love i have for my famili and kid  ive eaten at jimmi john franchis in florida illinoi wisconsin arizona nevada and typic anytim i find one anywher in between  jjs was my 1 pregnanc crave with my two babi  it was a huge reason ive felt homesick for the midwest befor locat start sprinkl the phoenix valley look at my facebook page  my profil pic in two differ instanc is me with my jjs sub or cup  i have the jjs parti cup in my cupboard and i hate clutter hodgepodg and crap peopl call me when they see new locat  i mean an exboyfriend call me year after wed broken up to tell me he saw one downtown and he just knew i love it so much i should know this  duh i total alreadi knew and i told him to lose my number

that be said i have offici experienc my first poor sub from ani franchis ani time of day or night ani citi at this one on bell  it pain me to disclos that my utter perfect sub 10 with dijon and sprout can actual be disgust and at the locat nearest to my hous i was shock heartbroken and bemus how could it be  becaus of my intens loyalti to this chain i can assur you i will be back  but my rose color glass are off and my dear belov jj no longer rank first in my heart of men whove never let me down  it a sad sad day folki hate write bad review so im gonna touch on the posit befor i touch on the negative

th positives

th restaur is love and nice decor  we sat on the patio and it was also veri pleasant out there too  the cinnamon roll that my best friend got was delici soft yeasti and just the right amount of frost too veri well made  the peach mimosa were fabul although at 7 each i thought they were too pricey  the staff is gracious and accommod although perhap not extrem attentive

th negatives

sinc we had other join us we were come in three stage and the waiter knew that but after our last diner arriv we sat there for sever minut wait for our waiter to show back up and take our order but he had vanish so we final had to flag down a busboy and ask for our waiter to return

i order the pull pork scrambl for about 11 and it was sweet  sweet  what the what  i pick at it tri to find a delici salti fork of meati pull pork that didnt tast like itd been slow roast in pancak syrup and i couldnt find one edibl bite  im sorri but sweet pork scrambl with egg and chees actual is a dismal combin  

the unsalt rosemari roast breakfast potato that came with my pork and scrambl egg somehow manag to lack ani zip or zing too  i ate one bite of the potato and gave up   this was also serv with two flour tortilla which were soft and warm but otherwis nondescript

ther was noth of note on my whole plate and the pork and egg was practic ined in my opinion  i sent my food back with about 4 bite taken out of it and sad the waiter didnt even think to question whi i was basic send a full plate of food back to the kitchen  

coffe is 225 and about as nondescript as coffe can be  i mean serious it tast like 50 a cup coffe except it wasnt it was 225  oh well

so in retrospect i paid about 26 for a breakfast that consist of about 5 bite of food from my own plate a cup of coffe a mimosa and a bite of my friend cinnamon roll

yep i wont be backdriven by a few time  use to be pop grill chees nice layout inside

w walk in around 1030 am on a sunday  the place is empti that not good

gf order a steak fajita omelet  someth like that  interest she ask for no bell pepper no onion and ask to add spinach and i believ mushroom  shes told they have to add 75 cent for each item  i advis the server that the item shes remov from the omelet  are 75 cent when order within the make your own omelet option so isnt fair not to charg for the add on sinc shes subtract two item yeah  i guess so  ok   of cours later those two item will show up on the bill

 i went with the countri fri steak and three egg hash brown and a pancak  ive attach a pic of the menu  so you can see the price and pic of the food

aft order and get coffe and water sever other parti came in  size from one person to 8 so busi start pick up  unfortun this is not good sinc there is one cook one server   eventu one coupl left after wait sever minut to even be acknowledged

th food did take some time to reach us but i tell ya  the food will keep us come back with the hope servic will improve

th gravi on the countri fri steak had good flavor chunk of bacon and sausag  the hash brown were season well and the pancak was decent size and had a slight sweet to my like  youll notic the menu has sever specialti pancak ala babystack so that might also garner anoth visit from me

th omelet was decent  it was 4egg size  couldv use some more chees but overal tasti stuff

prior to order we were told that the meal is cap off with some free banana fritter  after ask the now frazzl server for the fritter sever time over a 15 minut time span  we opt to leav sad 

this place has potenti but the servic kink need serious massagim not a chef and i dont play one on tv but if you dont know thatwhi not tri to sell to me anyway

first off park is horribl second it has this unseem smell insid the station third a lot of the vendor are too busi tri to pli their good to the known chef and other vendor to worri much about new sales

i was interest in the artisan chees and mushroom i was excit and look to tri a few ive never had befor and i was will to pay good money  especi know they wouldnt be cheap as they were unmark and know these thing are pricey  but the ladi who ran this stall was lack in inform detach emot from the product and instead of continu a convers i start just blew me off for one of the other vendor who sell to the chef 

unlik the younger peopl who come from pahrump  of whose produc i buy and enjoy  she was unenthusiast and inarticul which lead me to the guy roast coffe bean and sell bag of ground coffe just not engag or will to educ a possibl buyer and he had the best smell product too

expect to pay rough 30 percent more by my estim than at say the tivoli villag or spring preserv market locat cost i guess but there is a nice mix of veri nice produc some bread some food truck and more than a few crafts

okay if you have the time and money just dont expect great price or a lot of attentfinal got the chanc to see what allll the hype is about and honest i dont get it we arriv at about 8pm and i was piss that my bf took me here when i saw how long the line was it was veri veri veri long but it went fair quick total wait time was probabl 40 minut i think it weird how you get your first drink while your wait in line to pay and be seat then when you are dine a server bring you all your refil i think if they remov the soda station in the front the line would move a lot faster price is 1179pp for adult plus 199 for a drink so it come to about 15pp kid are cheaper and senior get like 050 off whoop dee doo lol

it was veri crowd in there and i felt a littl claustrophob tri to fight my way through the crowd to get to and from my tabl the buffet is pretti small and the food was just ok some item better than other i enjoy the meatloaf it was realli good and the fri chicken was decent mac and chees not good tast like tv dinner mac n chees the salad bar was quit big and fresh with lot of top includ real bacon and chunk of chicken they also had pizza spaghetti chili potato roll some veggi fri catfish and popcorn shrimp a few mexican item like enchilada and taco meat for taco and some chines item like orang chicken and fri rice they also had made to order steak which was probabl the best thing they had in the whole restaur but that was about the extent of it

aft i was done with the food i went and wait in line for dessert they had a few differ pud and cake on one side and the 3 dessert fountain on the other side where most everyon was wait i dip some fruit and marshmallow in the chocol and caramel sauc and they were pretti good they also have cotton candi and ice cream 

im glad i tri this place but unfortun i dont think i will be back with how mani other buffet are in this town i feel the select was lack for the price and it was just too crowd i say 2 star becaus the server were realli friend and alway on top of clear plate and refil drink and the dessert fountain were pretti good alsoi was realli amp up and readi for the best steak and meal of my life base on the review from yelp i had seen and becaus well it gordon ramsay  sad was disappoint and wont be return here

tri to get reserv about a week in advanc but all they had was 10pm or later  consid we sometim can be pass out in bed at that time in vega depend on how the day drink goe we decid to risk it and opt to see if we could get a tabl in the loung right at the open time  well it work  we were abl to get in right around 6pm when we walk up and need a tabl for 4  

the atmospher was pretti nice  great decor and the tabl had this cool light on them  waitress wear these sexi sequin short dress which made for good convers and eye candi for the men  i order a blueberri vodka and club soda which was delici  the other 3 in my parti didnt order anyth to drink husband was alreadi drunk and the other coupl dont realli drink much  howev look like they had a great wine select and they give it to you on an ipad which was cool

a for what we orderedmi husband and the other guy with us both order the kobe steak i order the salmon my friend order the seafood platter  for starter i got the salad and one other person got the shrimp cocktail  they were both fine  noth to rave about and not disappoint there realli  

then the food came out  so my salmon was bare lukewarm in the center and had no flavor whatsoev  i order mushroom on the side and they were ok  my husband kobe steak which was 80 i do believ was ok  it was rarer than medium which was how he order it but didnt want to send it back given the crowd and how long it might take  it was good i tri it so dont get me wrong  but ive had better steak that were 12 the price  he order the mash potatot on the side which were realli delici  go for it  i would say the salmon was on the list of bottom 10 salmon dish i have ever tri  mayb it was an off night or someth for that dish  i know they are known for the steak but  also i dont even think the waitress ever came back and ask how the food tast or we might have told her some of this feedback  mayb she didnt ask becaus she knew  haha

th total bill was 425 for 4 of us i had one cocktail and nobodi els drank so this was truli all foodno dessert for anyon either  veri pricey for so so food in my opinion  we have a chain restaur call firebird here that i would go to everyday for steak andor salmon befor i went to gordon ramsay  even if they were the same price id still choos firebirds

hop gordon goe to his restaur and experi the place like we did then hell yell at the chef and thing will chang for the better  i am torn between a 2 or 3 star we had a terribl time get a reserv my friend was visit and her flight was at 6am so she want to eat earli we had a 5pm reserv and they said they dont hold reserv i arriv at 440 and there were 4 hostess gab i walk up to check in and they told me i had to get in line to check in i said cant i just check in and wait at the bar nope they dont open the door until 5 seem to me id open at 4 and get some cocktail revenu plus wouldnt it be just as easi and more polit to just check me in but hey what do i know they were pretti snooti and i dont know whi bet they dont make enough to eat there so i stand in line like an asshol and wait then at 5 she yell out who has a reserv 

we are seat quick and the waiter bring an ipad with the specialti drink there are no price on the drink menu the tabl are on top of each other nyc style that would have been ok if they didnt squeez 5 peopl in a 4 top right next to me the guy was huge and i had to keep myself tuck in like the middl seat on a plane luckili they were realli nice and i had fun talk to them 

food
brown butter tortellini 20  it was ok
beef wellington 54 which is the signatur dish you can onli get it rare but it is bake so it isnt bloodi for us medium eater the wellington itself was pretti good i hate the sauc it was float in it tast like someth from nasa the root veget were fantast all 2 bite of them

pricewis ridic it was 210 plus tip to be squish in not abl to breath rude hostess and pretenti and annoy assist waiter our waiter was pretti nice and effici  so to sum up this rant dont bother id way prefer stk craft nine gallagh even outback actual almost anywher but here gordon need to show up here and do some swear def a tourist trap oh and one last thing i hate the music annoy the heck out of mejust had my birthday dinner here and i have to say that i wasnt too impress my boyfriend and i arriv to the restaur about thirti minut earli the hostess outsid the restaur were veri friend and escort us into the restaur as we were seat our waiter arriv and gave us an ipad when i made a reserv at the restaur i let them know that it was for a birthday dinner the waiter just ask whos birthday is it and i said mine he just look at me and said oh happi birthday with no enthusiasm and state that there were over 40 select of beer to choos from and cocktail and just left after wait over 15 minut our waiter come by and take our drink order 

we final order our entre and our waiter continu to have almost like a cocki attitud never smile never said thank you never even ask if we had ani question about the menu he just said are you readi i order our appet and my entre and our waiter look at my boyfriend and said and u what are you order it almost felt as if he was talk down on him 

we order the shrimp cocktail 19 three jumbo shrimp in a refresh sauc the watermelon cube complement the dish well i love the littl salt on the watermelon also the salt enhanc the watermelon flavor in a uniqu way i order the brais short rib 40 the meat was a littl fatti but flavor wise it was good it could have a littl more salt the spinach that came with the dish was veri salti though my boyfriend got the filet 54 the filet was good but we had better tast filet the meat was not as tender as we wish our side we order were mac n chees 13 and brussel sprout 12 both the side were delici the mac n chees has to be the winner tho 

fli from hawaii to celebr my 25th birthday here i was expect a better experi at the end of our meal our waiter just drop off the dessert menu and said our toffe cake is the best and rush off we end up not get dessert no complementari dessert was even offer i expect a place like this would offer someth small for a birthday or anniversari celebr but i guess not the say dont expect anyth becaus youll onli be disappoint was how i felt about this whole experi 

would not recommend this place food is good but there are plenti of delici place on the strip not a veri romant set loud did not feel special waiter suckis this a breweri or a coco i was so confus walk in to this place the ambianc is horribl lack and i could not get it off my mind  asid from some nimbus poster on the wall and a piec of copper brew equip in the corner by the fireplac you would have thunk this was whatev mediocr north scottsdal restaur live here before

                      sorri the review doesnt end with a yeaaah boyyyyi was soooo look forward to come here i even drag my friend and his grandson here to share the experi but when we arriv i look at the spars counter with 4 styrofoam contain of whoknowswhat sit in the display case i look at the 4 parti in front of us who had obvious order and were grow weari from wait and i saw a small tray of fri chicken under a heat lamp and one cook look frazzled

cut menu board post on the wall but i wasnt go to becom one of those poor soul starv and rub my eye as i wait 45 minut for a coupl piec of chicken

suggest get more help and make the wait area more comfortyeahhhh booooiiiii this place wasnt worth the hype and the price honest for the price you pay for small portion your better off get a complet meal at smith and you would be enjoy the same exact meal for a whole lot cheaper and more flavor now dont get me wrong the chicken had flavor but here were my issu with my experience

1 alway fresh chicken so you have to wait anywher from 1545 min um seem like i got the chicken from the previous day that sucker was so dri i thought i was gnaw on a dog bone so pleas explain to me whi i wait so long for dri up chicken bones

2 purchas 8 pcs to find the smallest piec of chicken ever um are these special chicken that need to be price that much look like they paid the cheapest price from their distributor and got midget chicken to overcharg the avg consum 

3 ask the cashier about side portion size and thought we were get a good deal for two regular size side come to find out we paid to have side that fit in your avg styrofoam contain serious the cashier had no idea what she was talk about how was this serious go to serv 2 peopl psshh

4 i swear they purchas their mac  chees from smith deli it tast exact the same

5 staff  im sorri but i felt like i was on some hidden camera show pleas dont ask them to explain the nondescript menu as they will give you attitud and ask what you dont understand about the menu also it alway reassur when you have your manag staff talk about deal gone bad and next time they see  there go to be troubl is this for real am i get punkd where ashton kutcher hide think of it as the movi friday meet waiting

so was it worth the hype nahhh boiiii i rather spend that much at smith or albertson know that the food and servic is betterno credit card accepted

pric were cheaper than walmart onli by a few cent not worth wait in line for a small savings

walmart will match winco ad

park was ok busi on a friday afternoon

no avail shop carts

lin were so long as if this was the onli groceri store in the entir valley check out my photos

bulk food area

too busi for my likei realli hesit to write this review but  i am do it with the sincer hope that it might actual help improv this place  i realli want to see it succeed as i work close by and would like to come here often  buti have a bad feel so far

i read the review so far and sever mention the exact experienceimpress i have of this place after two visit i went a second time realli hope it would be better

1 the music is too loud  the first time i went i sat in the upstairsoutdoor bar and i was struggl to hear the peopl at my tabl less than 2 feet from me  it was not onli loud but the music select wasodd  for this type of place which i thought would be upscalecasualeleg  mayb theyr go for a differ scenecrowd but this alon would keep me away  dont get me wrong  i like music  all type but the music here doesnt realli work in my opinion for the locat and who i think is the custom here

2 pleas dont make the server wear fishnet stock and tight black dress  it look ridicul  doesnt work at all  and just add to the what is this place go for overal confus  i like a cute girl as much as the next guy  but that all i need to make me happi  a cute girl bring me drinksfood and not feel like she has to put on the hooter hey im a cute girl pay attent to the middl age guy schtick  it fake and kind of silli  theyr all veri nice but pleas managersown  dont make them do this

3 the food at least what i had on my 2nd attempt was veri veri averag  i had the i think 14 green chile burger which was almost exact as good as almost exact the same burger at zipp for half the price  now dont go food expert crazi on me  im sure there must be some differ in the qualiti of the beef or someth  but for me  averag guy  it was not distinguish  youv just got to step it up for this price  andth cheesi cut board or whatev it is instead of a plate  really

lik i said  i realli want this place to work and still be around in 2 year  so im go to go in a coupl more time over the next few month and if someth goodbett ill happili modifi my review  but guy ownermanag there are just too mani great option for great food in this area  it could be that im not your target custom butim a middl age profession male who work right at the intersect  so i think i am

i am sincer hope for improvthe complimentari effici valet and steak salad are the star of this new steak house

th servic is the distract hostess was insist that we provid our name for the list although we are clear that our eat will be in the bar  they actaulli do no follow up with us although we are now on the list  huh

th bar maintain the same layout as houston had howev the hand of bartend never connect and they begin the intim relationship with a request for a credit card for the tab

mi friend and i order the black  green   13 and miyagi 14 version  the bg has wagyu beef blue chees and bacon  the miyagi has furikak fri egg onion ring and bacon  we also order parmesan truffl fri 5 and onion ring 350

first of all anoth tabl receiv their food befor us even though we were seat and order befor them  to add insult to injurti i was starv and they order the oxtail chili chees fri 1150 w fri egg on top  this plate look awesom  despit the forego the fri and ring were good when we final got them

both burger were ho hum  noth special  the bg did not have much blue chees and it was miss bacon on one side   the miyagi was just miss  it came out 15 min after my burger and at the same time as anoth custom who was seat well after us  when i ask the mgr where the miyagi was all he said was there was a problem in the kitchen  the real problem was that my friend burger was serv to anoth tabl becaus i saw miyagi be serv to other tabl where the patron came after us

th mgr did tri to show us some luv by give us complimentari portugues donut  we were eager expect pao doce sweet bread or malasada  unfortun what we receiv was fri dough that was the consist of a cake donut on the insid w the tast of cinnamon from a stale churro on the outsid  one word descript  nasty

i would not make the trek from the strip to come again  the food is noth special the price are high and the servic is spotti  i can get a much better burger and servic back home in oc at umami 25 degre and havenim write this hope someon read it and save this great restaur 
i love the burger here mine was great my wife order her protein style and all the lettuc came out coat in oil shes order it this way befor and it never been serv with oil forget about send it back we would never see it again
th host was set the tabl up for doom too mani tabl sat at the same time in the same server section made it a 10 minut wait for drink oh and point to my tabl from across the room doesnt feel like seat me
our server forgot our drink twice and when our burger final did come it onli took anoth ten minut for our fri to arriv after we had to ask about them i watch two other tabl send back food 
i love your food but im not head back anytim soon last night felt like a wast of money to medecid to tri this place after a few recommend from some friend as soon as we walk in we notic that it wasnt too busi and assum that we would be abl to get more attent servic when the host ask if it was just us two he seem to have an attitud and look bother when we were seat we were given water right away and ask if we want anyth els to drink and that when everyth went bad 
we decid right away what we want from look at the menu on line and close our menus to show that we were readi after about four minut we time to see how long it was actual take someon to notic that we were readi to order again it was not veri busi and a lot of the server were just walk about aimless and didnt give us a second look after 8 minut we were just amaz that no one even attempt to ask us what we want after 11 minut of wait my girlfriend final ask one of the girl clear the tabl if someon could pleas take our order now i understand when a place is busi and you might have to wait a few minut or even remind your waiter your readi but when you have a bunch of peopl in the back who give the appear of not do anyth but chat and just walk around is not accept 
onc we final order our food from our server who apolog for the wait we thought that everyth would be ok from there again we were wrong we decid to tri the oxtail fri spici miso burger and the miyagi the oxtail fri were alright and land up be the onli appet part of our meal the miyagi burger was just ok it was pretti greasi and i could bare tast ani of the bacon the spici miso burger was not good at all it was not remot spici and after eat less than half the burger it start to tast realli soggi we open the burger up and the meat was just fall apart and look like mush it was more rare than medium at this point it was about an hour that we had been there we didnt want to send the burger back for fear of have to wait longer when we just want to leav 
final the check came and again we wait anoth ten minut befor my girlfriend had to hail the waitress to ring us out she apolog again but at this point apolog didnt mean anyth 
we mightv just come here on an off night but even off night have some redeem qualiti i will not be come back to this place ever and was veri disappointif you like go to club you will love this place if you valu good servic a friend attitud realli good food and a good valu go somewher else

thi is a classic case of poor manag both time i went there we found tabl avail but were told to wait 1520 minutes

th first time i had a plane to catch by the time i was seat and they final came over to take our order i had to leave

th second time i gave them a chanc long wait and by the time one of the hip waitress came over the ice in my soft drink had melt 

the burger were decent but honest there is a japanes burger truck that goe to various locat it a lot better a lot more fun and better price 

as i said befor the crowd that goe here seem realli in and trendi and act like they are sit at vip tabl in a club  the waitress act like they are cocktail waitress at a club the manag think they are realli cool

if they had a product that justifi this arrog attitud fine my wife thought they had great sweet potato fri that about iti was so excit to tri this place i see their tweet everyday and last week i thought today is the day im final gonna go mistake

i decid to go through the drive thru as their patio look pack i got to the speaker order my sandwich the club and ask what side they had sinc they were nowher on the menu the guy on the other end of the speaker sigh and said hed be right out um ok he came to my window and said yeah we dont have them list but peopl usual know i explain that this was my 1st time there and he repli well we have chip and fruit and a littl salad i ask what kind of chip they had and he sigh and said sun chip what kind all of them french onion sigh nope i ask for whatev he had he then said well the combo again not list on the drive thru menu come w lemonad or ice tea i gave him my choic and he said i was all set and off he went now they were veri veri busi so i dont fault them for my wait time at all howev a coupl of the guy that were work the lunch shift this day were so unprofession when i was at the window after i had sign my receipt one of them hung out the window to have a shout convers w one of his friend that was leav as for the guy who took my order i never saw him again i got my food and left

let me tell you what i paid almost 10 for a small lemonad a bag of sun chip and a tini sandwich are you kid me i mean i know theyr categor as a healthi place but this sandwich was about as small as a mcdonald hamburg and unfortun not veri tasty

i dont think ill be go backive read the rave review about the main lobster ladi food truck in the past but actual happen to find it this past weekend at the scottsdal art festiv i was so excit to tri authent main lobster roll as i have never been to main nor had a lobster roll befor we walk up and notic the price of 18 for a lobster roll 14 for lobster mac and chees fri haddock sandwich for 12 and blueberri lemonad for 3 servic was veri friend and was told to tri the lobster roll cold sinc that how they eat it in new england we also order the mac and chees i mean how often do you see mac and chees lobster i also order the blueberri lemonad and wait a few minut for the food

th lobster roll was tini there was no sauc and look noth like the lobster roll ive seen befor i got a few piec of claw meat with a few piec of lemon on top in a tini size hot dog look roll my friend order the lobster mac and said it was cold i even took a bite and was shock it would be cold it was also cook with a penn pasta which is not mac and chees the onli thing i enjoy was the blueberri lemonad 

for 43 food and tip this was a total disappointthis review is for the even came here on a saturday night after the polo tournament and felt this place was tri to be hollywood unsuccess it pretti with cabana and a pool henc the 2nd star unfortun the crowd was realli odd with a lot of older men and cougar danc to hous music like it 1981 i order a mojito from a male bartend and it was rude serv to me as one of the worst drink i have ever tast there was a fashion show go on to benefit breast cancer but unfortun they didnt promot it correct nobodi understood what was go on and there were absolut no announc mayb the cloth were for sale no idea the cocktail server also were in pink attir but took it a littl far with pink tutus and save second base tees

upsid to this place the staff who work the door are friend and the place is pretti with cabana and a pool mayb ill come here again dure the day to see if it redeem itself in the meantim i suggest they find new bartend statdure one of my busi trip last week i decid to tri a lesson in time manag and actual get to the airport on time not onli did i succeed i arriv earli enough to grab a bite to eat so im not stuck with peanut enter sauce

not too shabbi of a place for be insid an airport i guess ill have to agre with a review below me  the servic is ehh and they dont care about much more than take an order for exampl it was my first time and i had a coupl question about the build your own pizza and the guy at the cash regist was less than thrill i order a glass of chardonnay and he ask me if i want ice oh god whi didnt i just turn around at that point

so i order a basic pizza it had some fanci name to it but it was just a chees pizza thin crust minim sauc the ironi and not much to be rememb so i order anoth glass of chardonnay and suck it up 

note the seat arrang is aw there are bar stool and tabl and you wont find a seat for awhil becaus the tabl seat up to 4 peopl and if 1 person took that tabl  they wont seat you there 

howev it is probabl the best youll get if you need to dine in at the airport  unless you want mcdonald or some crap mexican food the price arent bad about 9 for a whole pizza and 5 for chardonnay along with a varieti of other item pasta salad sandwich breakfast food mayb i just order the wrong stuff but i dont see myself go back for round twosorri i have to be a downer 

i got the 80 omakas hubbi got the 120 

the grill dish were not worth it the sashimi was decent the nigiri was veri good 

i would just order nigiri piec and skip the omakas 

mi favorit was chutoro and uni the premium toro of the cheek and belli both had a slight chew fatti connect tissu they were good but definit not worth the titl of premiummayb it what i order but i wasnt impress with this place at all  their decor was realli nice especi with their chocol fountain  

we order the crepe with the exot fruit on it all it had was the crepe the fruit were i guess all pure togeth and bit of mango  sinc all the fruit were pure to me it tast and had the textur of babi food it was too weird and not so good the ice cream that it came with was pretti good though  it was coconut and it had real coconut shave in it

overal the place is cute but everyth is realli overpr  our crepe was 10 and look at everyth els it pretti overpr but then again what do you expect  it vegabelow averag chain restaur food 

came here on a groupon didnt have high expect after read the review which are spot on  we start out with the calamari that was averag noth special and then we share prosciutto e tarufo pizza this pizza was probabl one of the worst pizza ive had i never let a pizza slice go uneaten but in this case we let almost the entir pizza go uneaten the prosciutto tast old and the combo of mushroom and the truffl oil they were both fight to take the titl of strong flavor the drink menu was less than desir as well i tri the mojito on the recommend of of our server it was way too artifici tasting

in the end this was way overpr and underwhelm food onli thing this place has go for them is their outsid patio that face lv blvd 

if you do still decid to go after all of these glow review park in the underground garag or the valet off of lv blvd it locat under lavoplenti of space

disclaim my father made the reserv for this place without tell me

i like the layout of dal toro plenti of space with tabl not obnoxi pile atop one anoth like vega tract hous we sat near the window in an lshape booth which overlook spacious outdoor seat along the strip a minibar was out there too with a trio of gal sip gir drink wait for peopl to notic them befor they went back to their room at day inn

aft we were seat we went down into the basement

th basement

just freak your ass out didnt i

but it true and down there they have a nice collect of high price automobil on display some ferrari benz porsch and muscl car a coupl of bentley and a few other shitwagon a nice littl side trip befor dinner

back upstair we look over the menu dad and i had a caraf of pinot grigio while mom stole sip from our glass and repeat for the umpteenth time that she doesnt drink 

mom

our server was cool complet with dri humor and paisano look we order a kobe beef appet and were disappoint there was noth much to it a few piec of paper thin red mush buri beneath some green we argu about who was go to eat the last piec not becaus we each want it but becaus none of us want it for the record i wash it down with bread and wine

on to the entre 

mom and i went with shrimp and lobster ravioli dad decid on some fish call baramundi sound like some italian dictat from the old day to me but what the hell

th verdict could bare see the lobster let alon tast it and the shrimp were low in number six rather flat ravioli to a plate and i ate one of my mother the sauc was okay but veri littl bang for the buck with this entre my dad like his fish but he alway say he like his meal when he pick the restaurant

mi parent split some sort of chocol round thing for dessert while i devot my effort to drain the caraf unfortun i was not born with a sweet tooth i my friend have been curs with the dread alcohol tooth

so there you have it our even at dal toro if you like space and arent too hungri you might give it a tri then again mayb you shouldntanoth typic scottsdal overhyp eateri  food wasnt as good as these rave review are make it out to be  food was overcook bacon was burnt and bun were kind of lame portion were somewhat on the small side although for scottsdal the price was inexpens by scottsdal standard  realli strang beer price  german import and american microbrew were reason price but the belgian import were mark up like they were liquid gold twice what you would pay for the same beer at ohso delux or papago  i was there on open day so ill leav my comment about servic for anoth review after they have time to settl in

gav it anoth chanc and servic still hasnt improv  had to knock it downi love the concept i love the decor i love the idea hope the food can catch up 

we knew go open week would be under par as the staff tri to gain their groov so we went in with id say low expect we werent disappoint our server knew noth about the product on the menu or the beverag offer 

mi friend each got craft brew and were offer nonchil glass they opt to just drink out of the bottl i tri the strawberri field cocktail it tast pure of artifici syrup  noth fresh about it and i couldnt tell if the vodka made it in the glass or not

w decid to start with the pretzel and then each opt for differ brat so we could share and get a varieti the pretzel didnt come out till the brat did  so much for order an app when it did final arriv it was a veri dark brown and somewhat mangl look  we could have gotten past that if it at least tast good but not onli was this pretzel an eye sore it was a mouth sore it was everyth you dont want a pretzel to be  tough chewi and burnt final the brat the brat themselv werent bad but the bratbread ratio was way off we receiv these huge brat bun that were easili doubl the size of the actual brat i wouldnt call myself a brat aficionado i just cant imagin how you screw up such a simpl and easi item  especi if you are the brat haus the one item of the whole even actual worth note was the apricot chutney it was flavor and the onli reason i was abl to finish my breadi meal 

i would be up to give them anoth chanc it seem everyon els had a much better experi i hate to leav bad review but hey you cant win them allthe brat were pretti tasti though there are better more flavor avail  the bun are not quit right  we tri one of the pretzel and while the mustard was spot on the first pretzel wasnt cook right and the chef dispos of it and brought us a new one  the new one was onli margin better  should have been softer with a nice crust and sea salt on top big disappoint there

also the price was an issu for the the money you should get a side dish frys potato salad someth to lessen the kick in the pantive been wait for someth like this to come to surpris and was real excit to take the famili and friend there when it open  went a few day befor the actual grand open and had a good time but my mood instant chang when i went out to get someth in my truck and came insid to a bouncer tell me they were at capac  when i told him i had famili in there he made me seem like a liar and he want me to call my girlfriend to come to the front just so i could go back in not a good way to start your busi  

so i thought what the heck let tri it again anoth weekend so last weekend i went with some other famili to show them how nice it was i mean they have tvs everywher an awesom arcad and even have a 21 and older section for after 8pm that has it own lane bar pool tabl and dj booth for the weekend and it doesnt cost ani extra which is kind of cool  first thing when we walk through the door was anoth bouncer tell me they were at capac and they had a 2 hour wait when clear i could see from the door there was open seat everywher and there were mani open lane  after about 15 min of wait in line i ask the ladi if i could use the restroom she told me i could go next door to the movi theatr and use there becaus she didnt trust me that i would come back from their  awesom servic sarcast speak 

i would give this place more star but the servic and peopl are terribl the food was good and bowl was a littl overpr but your pay for luxuri pretti much  

if they wanna stay in busi they need to work on their custom servicealot mayb start by get rid of the stupid were at capac thing when your not even close to it 

ill probabl wait a while befor i go backjudg by the other review i was expect this place to be pretti awesom i have  a feel that none of the peopl give it high rate so far have had good bbq 

honest this is probabl the most overcook bbq ive ever had with the except of the brisket which was tough and clear undercook the rib were pretti much mush they couldnt even be pick up the bone just slid out of the meat that call overcook rib should not fall off the bone the pork was dri and a bit tough i wouldnt be surpris if they were serv leftov of that the chicken was even drier than the pork there wasnt enough sauc in the build to bring that back to life 

as far as the sauc go the sweet  spici one whatev it call was pretti good better than most sauc youll find elsewher the teriyaki was horrend that a flavor that doesnt belong with bbq in ani way shape or form i tri it with each of the meat and none of them went well with it 

i also wasnt impress with the overal vibe of the place it felt dead  the staff seem less than enthusiast to be there 

if your in the area and theyr open it may be worth a shot if you have no clue what good bbq is otherwis it a nogoyelper you just cant judg the tast of the food if that were the case this place would get 2 more star the problem is it is just too gritti to inspir confid gritti exterior gritti interior gritti worker gritti custom gritti servic there is also the issu of space  one insid tabl and the menu  almost useless as they had less than half of what was on there last time i was there and the peopl  the person at the counter yell at someon in anoth room to stop play the drum loud and poor multipl time and the peopl just hang out not eat drink or work just meander in and out of the place no place to eat san the singl occupi tabl except outsid which is ugli and cold in decemb the cook was do some errand so i was told there would be a small wait which turn into an unreason long wait on the bright side the food is good inexpens and vegan the grit lead one to question the sanitari practic and i just cant get past thatim go to give this place 2 star instead of 1 becaus im go to return and i have hope you guy i realli do

but went here last friday at lunchtim pull up place seem extraordinarili sketchi but my work friend and i were game we park and walk up onli to find the place complet board up there was spray paint that read close on one of the door is the place closed

i heard peopl insid so i walk over to the other door which had a sign state their hour too bad their hour were cover up with sharpiedrawn heart what

i tri to pull open the door sinc i heard peopl insid the houseshackrestaur but the door must have been lock or rust shut becaus i couldnt open it

until then mayb someon could messag me and give me a head up when their hour are id realli like to goah no  came here on a groupon and we will not be back  we order the following
walnut shrimp was ok  noth special
orang beef my favorit nonauthent dish and it was such a huge disappoint  the meat was chewi eww and the batter was soggi ewwer  
veget stir fri  basic stir fri with carrot broccoli snap pea  cant mess this dish up
brown rice upcharg fee of 1 sinc we want brown instead of white rice  
milk tea wboba at the promo price of 1 boba was kinda hard like it has been sit there for a while  as cheap as it is i did not get a second  

i have experienc better and needless to say i will not returncame thisclos to ruin my babi shower we order both a cake and 24 cupcak the cake made it to gilbert store for pick up but the cupcak did not initi the sale peopl told me to go pick it up at the temp storeuhno i call the day befor to confirm deliveri for a reason then the girl in both store act like they didnt have a clue how to fix this situat without ashley the manag i inform them that i will need to speak with ashley well about 20 minut befor the shower start ashley call to tell me shed be person deliv them surprisesom random guy came to deliv and weve never even had so much as an apolog from ashley not a great way to run a small busi if you ask mei dont like write these type of review if onli a restaur would live up to it decor and menuwrit blue hound would be a hit unfortun the food and the servic didnt live up to the hype but in respons to all of the four and fivestar review there need to be a dose of realiti here folk did we eat the same food

let start with the good the restaur is dazzl hip fill with beauti peopl accent by onli the most sophist light and fill with the energet buzz that set our expect high my first thought this will be a home run

i ate there with a group of foodi friend all of whom were saliv with excit to tri what appear to be a innov and tasti menu and it receiv all this posit press the media is alway rightright

for appet we order the endless caramel popcorn poor pop kernel season with a nonnuanc avalanch of ancho chile where was the butterscotch flavor the tater tot were underwhelm and the dip tast like potato soup out of the can the hickman farm devil egg were the one shine moment of the entir meal with an excel balanc of flavor and textur 

i order bob indian red peach salad for my entre and was surpris with a veri scantilyfil rectangular plate contain a small smatter of peach marcona almond a tidyand tinypil of pepper cress green and a few tini lump of fromag blanc the peach were delici but overal it was all present and no substanc 

also order was the ancho chile brais pork neck which was a soupi concoct with er no appar sign of pork in it for 17 blue hound feel free to includ a speck of meat just sayin 

when the 4 wide crock of mac n chees was set down in front of us mind youthi is consid an entre we almost had to giggl at it diminut size tell me when one order mac n chees are they feel like nibbl on a samples portion i think not fail

hop alway remain high for dessert so we order with gusto a few cake n shake the nutella shake was dismal and the chocol cake bite tast on par with costco bakeri good lemon blueberri chees cake or should they be call tube the cheesecak was serv in a bewild tube shape plop unappet on a bed of granola and blueberri not love but odd and an order of the most dri flavorless mound of carmel pineappl upsid down cake ever put into my mouth it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it

in summari if you want to blow a few hundr buck on a lacklust mediocr and disappoint meal that pretend to be so much more the blue hound is for you it a shamerockin taco is locat on the second floor  the bar overlook the strip  bf and i sat at the bar and grab food from the adjac station  i order a salad with beef and guac  the staff was stingi with the ingredi  the quesadilla was okay  meat was 2 extra and there was also a 2 extra charg for the guac  meat is low grade and is tough

bartend was shadi  she hit on my bf onc when i went to get food and anoth time when i went to the restroomthe wife and i were have lunch togeth for the first time in age  she suggest a place near my offic and i found the corn flower use my yelp mobil app  it was show 45 star and a menu that sound delici  we were on our way  befor i get too far into this review let me just say that we met both the cashier and the execut chef and they were both wonder warm and genuin nice peopl  i could tell that the chef care veri much for her product and was veri excit to hear that i would be review her restaur  in fact she made sure to ask me to  so here goes

thi is a veri small dine room locat at the end of a strip mall on the corner of tatum and greenway  we had some difficulti find it  you walk in and it like walk in to a retail store not a restaur  there were enough tabl and seat for about eight peopl all decor veri nice with paper flower and pictur  one wall contain a huge glassfront refriger that was fill with various size packag of their signatur item empanada  the menu is written on a chalk board abov the cashier counter  while it is veri clean and wellappoint it did not give off a restaur vibe but rather a store  the corn flower bill itself as fine casual mexican cuisin and seem to be more of a cater establish tri to be a storefront tri to be a restaur  unfortun for me it doe not succeed at be a sitdown restaurant

w order from the chalkboard menu i had three carnita street taco and a groundbeef empanada and the wife had cornchowd soup with chip  we both opt out of the can soda from the display case and instead ask for ice tea  the cashierwaitress describ it as an arnold palmer which was fine with both of us howev it tast like instant  the cashierwaitress grab a packag empanada from the display case and took it back to the kitchen  after a few minut my street taco arriv arrang nice on a long narrow tray garnish with chop green onion and a salsa  it was okay  next my empanada arriv a singl empanada on larg round plate no garnish no dip sauc or anyth  it was warm and tasti but the fill was dri  final my wife corn chowder arriv  it was a larg bowl fill with about six ounc of creami undistinguish soup  no garnish  she ask for chip that should have arriv with it  the cashierwaitress brought the chip on anoth larg plate  wife ask for a spoon  meanwhil we stole napkin from anoth tabl  the soup did tast like corn  kind of like cream corn  not bad but not delici either actual kinda bland and not much of it for 8  some addin would be nice like chunk of avocado and dice chile  especi for the price 
  
overal the food was not bad but there was noth that realli wow me or made me want to come back for more  present was lack and servic need to be hone  im not one to tell a chef how to run her busi but it prolli not a good idea to grab a diner meal from a display case in front of them  mayb you should have some product in the kitchen  it wouldnt hurt to serv the empanada with some sort of sauc as well  perhap a fresh guacamol or salsa and smaller portion dictat smaller serv contain  chip can and should be serv in a basket not a plate and again should have some sort of dip sauc to go with  same thing for the taco  i could tell that the chef and the server realli care about their product and i hope that they figur out way to amp up the restaur side of thing as there is huge potenti herethe servic here is abysmal

although the food is pretti good though on the pricey side for  a specialti pizza 26 the servic level experienc is beyond atroci 

our visit occur on a midweek even not busi at all in fact near all of the nonbooth center area tabl were empti we were prompt seat but then the wheel fell off 12 minut wait for our server to final show up and ask for a drink order  it got wors after that some exampl server no where to be found to refil or ask if we want anoth round observ him chat with friend nearbi without regard or even a glanc over at his few tabl clear our plate without ask if we were even finish rush out the check take it back while wait and then take the paid tab while we were still seated

hey brandon or brendan have some class you were rude classless and unprofession 

the lack of train throughout the front of hous wait staff is clear evid at this locat this was our second time at this locat and the servic was even wors than open week 

outsid of the servic the smallwar are except cheap for 26 for a specialti pizza i would expect it to be serv on a decent plate with decent silverwar the stuff use here is the cheapest plastic plate and ultra thin tabl ware 

like i said the pizza and other food we had is pretti good but the servic level make sure you dont enjoy the food or the experii like everyth about this place except for the food i had a grill panini  which consist of ham turkey tomato and way too much honey mustard i thought it tast aw my wife had the lobster bisqu soup which was lukewarm she thought it was just ok the person get the soup ask me if i want asiago crouton with the soup i said ok and unknow agre to be charg an addit 59 cent i thought it was part of the deal with the soup that realli piss me off when i got to the regist note to manag  you might think your make extra buck with that soft upsel method but you are realli lose return custom whi dont you be unfront and honest and say would you like some asiago crouton with the soup for an addit 59 cents

thi place look like they had great dessert a great altern to the ice cream place around desert ridg they had an ipodpc charg station and the seat and general vibe to the place was great

it might be a long time befor i give this place a second chancok so i too went on open night and one has to expect some bump in the road  i call my experi tonight the good the bad and the ugly

first the good  the place is realli nice cool look great bar and an excel outsid seat area  our server audra i believ her name was we spot on  ran around tend to our need and felt bad about what is about to come the bad and ugli  also great beer select and a veri good menu which will get me back there to give them one more tri in a month or so  we also had the app sampler which came with onion ring black and tan grill wing risotto ball and chicken tender  all the item were veri tasti but not hot i am sure due to the pressur in the kitchen

th bad  ok again open night but it took the kitchen 1 hour and 45 minut to get my wife my daughter and myself out three salad for dinner onc our salad came  my wife order a cobb salad and what came out was a wedg  i got my steak salad and my 9 year old daughter sat there with noth  not good  after send back my wive salad it took anoth 20 minut to come out and her came with my daughter  i also saw other patron wait a long time for food food was slow slow slow come out of the kitchen but again it had to be due to open night i hope

now the ugli  look owner or possibl owner who i saw there that night it open night  your joint is pack and you made no and i mean no attempt to walk around the place greet guest except for the tabl of your pal  i saw one owner sit in a chair near the patio and seem focus on walk tabl insid and out  the other thing they seem mesmer in was this fire pit by the patio  it nice but if you have 100 peopl in your place on open night all look for food shouldnt you stop look at that and show it to your friend and help  or better yet whi not walk around the place  welcom your new and potenti futur custom say  thank you and at least show some concern for the issu of the night

not to mention hey mr or ms manag peopl we sent food back whi are you not out apolog for the error in the kitchen  custom servic is the 2 reason whi i go to a place or not  i would alway prefer to go to a 4 star place with great servic than a 5 star with no servic  

i have to assum that kitchen issu will be resolv and i will give the place a second tri base on the menu and select of beer  but if this place doe not get better custom servic orient with it manag especi with blue 32 next door a great food and servic joint it will just be anoth place on the restaur trash heapi love coffe shop and i tri my hardest to find the small local spot be from philli we have uniqu option on everi block so i was excit to find a differ type of coffe spot here 

i went in and the two barista were talk laugh and well just ignor me stand there final one came over and just said yes so i order an espresso base drink  which was good and ask about ani vegetarian sandwich option she laugh and said no 

ok so i settl for a bagel with cream chees i state that i was eat here and they plop the drink and bagel both togo on the counter and yell bagel 

i pack up my comput took by half burnt bagel and left 

no thank6 for fri is ridicul burger fri and a diet coke should not cost 20i expect more the burger were dri salti and didnt have anyth special about them their suppos addict fri sauc is an over hype 1000 island dress that should be slather on all their burger if it that special the shoestr fri were good and generous portion the restaur itself had a diner type feel look at the diner will tell you that if youv seen the insid of a gym late you shouldnt be eat at freddi last night was about rebel a littl  but given the qualiti and tast of the food  i could have made a more satisfi choic of place to indulge
their servic was veri friend lead me to think they hire a good group andor freddi treat their employe right2 star for their fri pickl veri tasty

wa onli here support our friend for the bikini contest

i realli dont care for this place not becaus there are half nake girl walk around pretend to be your server  but becaus theyr soooo stupid  clueless theyr friend  but our waitress didnt even know the menu at all and big minus for just throw my overflow drink on the tabl have it spill all of the place ugh 

no trip in the near futur for methis  place so complet fail to make an impress on me that i almost forgot we were here we stop in for someth to drink on a hot las vega afternoon we sat at the bar and order two absolut and cranberri our bill was 3000 that high even for vega in my younger day the veri attract staff might have been enough to draw me back here but not anymorafter my first visit to flame kabob i wouldnt recommend this place there must be some place in vega that serv outstand mediterranean food at a good valu  in this case i search onlin again and found out about flame kabob from restaurantcom  i subscrib to their servic and want to use a 10 coupon  the plan was to spend the requir 15 to use the coupon which should have cover the check  

when i arriv the first thing i notic was that the post price vari from the actual price  the manag defiant told me he had the right to chang his price anytim he chose  while i agre i submit he should probabl updat his menus

next when i place my order the manag argu with me when i ask for a combo with no fri or rice  i just didnt want the carb and i didnt ask for anyth addit  this simpl request seem to be muchtoomuch howev it didnt need to turn into a debate

afterward when i attempt to use my 10 discount certif the store manag scof at me complain how too mani peopl want to use couponsuh then whi do you use them as a market tool

fin while the food was tasti the portion were a bit stingi and i was sour by the whole encount with the managfirst note we had a groupon for this locat we had 20 to use the owner told us that to use the groupon we had to each buy a drink and pay a 15 gratuiti on the bill the fine print on groupon say noth about have to buy drink and ad a 15 gratuiti i know this guy was scam us but i paid the differ to just get this over with

w order a beef shish kabob and a beef and lamb shwarma the food took a littl while to come out to us the food was not bad at all the beef shish kabob was actual pretti tasti the shwarma had a bit too much gristl the saffron rice was okay noth to write home about pita bread and hummus was good didnt find it too oili although i have heard complaint on that the owner did even come by and give us extra pita bread he also had us tri the green sauc which wasnt too bad it had a nice spice to it though i had seen it earlier and comment that it look old the owner also mention that the beef was import from some countri like australia and said it had no hormon that i didnt believ this come from the owner who had alreadi scam us into buy drink and gratuiti 

one good note from the own scam us to get drink was tri the sour cherri ice tea that was delici im not normal an ice tea drinker as i prefer more sugari drink but this was a great blend of flavor and light tast definit the best part of the experience

though the place is onli go to get two star howev the fact that the owner scam us into spend more money give insight on how the whole oper is run it true busi that run groupon do not make money of those they actual are more like to lose money in the short term as they are give away food the point of this is to increas foot traffic and get peopl in the door and have a nice experi so they can tell their friend 

what the owner is do is alien the peopl who do use these deal this may be accept in the short term but in the long term they will have veri littl repeat business

plus this locat had been on dirti dine onli a month previous where he mention that some of the meat is pre cook so whi would he talk about the import of great beef if it import and the green sauc in that episod had been out for 11 day just seem like the owner tri to talk his way out of thing 

i can understand where the owner is come from the strip mall where this restaur is locat is a dead zone noth realli surviv in the space the atmospher around the locat is abysm and just down right spooki at time at how quiet it is the insid of the actual restaur is also like that with the lack of patron and the quiet of the music 

overal the food wasnt bad and i would have been up for a return visit but question tactic by ownership has realli dampen ani chanc for thatso sorri but after spend about 3 year back east i aint no expert but ive had my share of italian icewat ice and i can honest rememb it be smoother and more flavor rita version is a slight water down and less flavor ice

th custom servic here is stellar servic with a smile sampl to tri to help you decid but unfortun for me the qualiti and the product use just fall short
wifey got a small cherri ice and i play it safe and got a small mango orang ice with vanilla custard to get that creamsicl like tastefirst tast no second tri nope third trynot onli was it water down the custard was off
th custard was also the lowest qualiti i have ever tast like frozen cool whip

even freddi cjs and nielsen custard are better but luvit is still king of custard
luckili i got a small becaus i didnt finish which is veri rare for me i even tri a few spoon of wifey cherri ice and it tast and smell like i was eat one of those cherri air freshen that too was a small and that too wasnt finishedlik they say to each his ownstop by and give rita a tri for me it just wasnt my cup of tea i mean ice and custardalohathis is anoth one of those place that i decid to give the benefit of the doubt and yes im not impressedtot meh
a mention in various review great concept but the execut fall short cooki are bake in big batch and  left out uncoveredhealth code violat end up hard  and coldpretti tini too
bit into the cold hard cooki and your cold ice cream spill out the sidesfail

noth is better than a proper made warm soft cooki sandwich with cold ice creamyou have oven and more than enough employe to chang up your execut a bittot miss out on the temperaturetextur contrast that will get peopl come back for more dont take my word for it cream in berkley ca has the same concept execut flawlesslywarm bigger cooki out of the oven with two scoop of ice cream for onli 2 no wonder they have a line out the door on a daili basi they do it right

im just be honest and tell it like it is and when you have great ingredi equip and labor to do it right it is veri disappoint when the end product is what you get here ill just stick to do it my way the right wayi got thrifti close by in aliant and i alway keep cooki dough in the freezerp    aloha

yelp 100 challeng 201376100 unsweeten addicti flip the rate between two and three star tri to decid which would be most accur after much debat i settl on the two  truth be told id like to rate the free hous at a 25  275 but i cant rate it a full 30 in good conscience

 been to the fhp four time sinc theyv open and each experi has been mix  ive yet to sit insid as the patio area is realli wonder  the cover tabl the fieldston ground cover and the alcov feel make for a relax and enjoy place even when the thermomet is point well into the tripl digit  there ampl shade so that help a bit

th tap select are excel  kudo to the fhp for their great tast in micro brew  while the offer arent exot they are well round and i guarante therel be someth for everyone

scotch and whiski select are decent as well youll find most of the usual suspect on their liquor menu  price are reason the two pour i had were clinic  clear measur to the exact ml  

the food and servic are where the mix feel come into play  the server are friend but spars  on three of the four visit we sat for some time between drink food seem to take a long time to arriv followup were few and far between  dure one of the visit we had an except great server who was prompt super friend help and great with followup  but 1outof4 doe not a 4star review make

food qualiti has been consist meh  i know wisconsin like it food to border on the bland side but come on  weve tri the jalapeno popper which were uniqu presnt  slice on the half grill and fill with cream chees asid from the jalapeno flavor they were bore  despit be char there wasnt much smokegril flavor and the cream chees tast like gruel  we had high hope for it but were left for wanting

th chees curd were pedestrian on par with what youd find at ani number of place  if your look for a handmad curd look elsewhere

for entre weve tri a bunch i wont go into tremend detail as this would soon turn into a novel  the sandwich are breadi and bland  chicken didnt have ani uniqu flavor burger were on the dri side and the beef was lost by the top  a good burger should stand on it own  

the salad are nice but when ad chicken id appreci a littl more than 3  35oz of flavorless chicken breast  the load grill chees was embarrass  someon mentioen it in a filter review and our experi was the same as his

with each visit weve left with a happysad feel  the drink and atmospher are consist good  the food is consist underwhelm  the servic is consist off  the price is hard ever a valu weve averag around 4855 per visit for 23 people

i know it hard to make a new place work but id pay more attent to give the food some recogniz flavor improv the servic a bit and easeup on the breadi of the sandwich  a littl tweak and this could be a solid place

th free hous pub  meh

food  2 stars
servic  2 stars
valu  2 stars
misc  35 stari probabl would have given this restaur 2 12 star if i could have but didnt think it deserv a 3 star rate  the term meh definit appli here  noth excit with the food drink servic or atmospher  the homemad chip guac and salsa were all bland and the portion size was veri small  my sandwich and my dine companion burger were veri bland  oh and dont order the sweet potato fries

if your look for a burgersandwichfri place you can find much better in madison or even middletoni was not feel over energet so i wander down to the food court of the casino to find someth to take back to the room i had not yet tri earl of sandwich so i gave it a tri the servic start off poor i stood by the order area for some time befor anyon even acknowledg i was there after that they were reason friend and help but i almost walk away

odd enough i did not order a sandwich instead i order the baja chicken stuf potato it come with butter sour cream jalapeno and presum chicken i had ask for mine without the tomato that normal come on it my potato came out relat quickly

th potato had some good flavor the jalapeno are a nice touch the potato is good size and fill me up the issu with the potato was the complet lack of chicken i am not sure there was ani on it i did not have it in me to go back down there to correct the issue

mi first experi here was lack  i will tri earl again and will tri a sandwich at that timewell i final tri this place with a friend of mine i was kinda interest to see how this would go sinc i saw that it had open they let you choos your own soup base the type of noodl and the top you want well i didnt realli know what to pick i didnt ani explan as to what kind the soup base were i had to googl them on my phone and for me the soup base is the most import part so i know what sort of top i want so i sort of just wing it while my friend went with one of their soup from the menu

wel his soup was serv first and upon look at it it look like it was lack just thing in general and was get worri about mine which came out a few moment afterward look at mine and look at his i found mine to be veri full  full of noodl veggi and top while his well as state was lack well i cant say i love my soup i found it miss someth mayb if i knew more about their soup base i might have been better equip to make choic the soup didnt suck but it wasnt as awesom as i want it to be 

i dont know if ill be back anytim soon but id probabl tri it again to see if it get betteri love the decor of avalon so much that i was realli happi to see anoth restaur take over the space  so when the unthink happen and my husband took a day off of work to spend with me i pick seven for breakfast  with the except of one other tabl we had the restaur to ourselv  i was surpris to see a bartend at 10 am on a monday morn so my husband put him to work with a bloodi mari which receiv high mark  i talk myself out of a mimosa and was glad i did becaus my orang juic was not onli not fresh squeez it tast like concentr  

as much as i want seven to be my favorit breakfast spot it need a littl work  i like crispi hash brown but these were so overdon there was no sens of a potato left  but our main complaint was the level of salt use  my husband order the meat lover benedict and instant comment it was too salti  well with jalapeno bacon canadian bacon and prosciutto i thought it was somewhat understand but the egg and hollandais should have balanc it out a littl  with my own breakfast i would discov the problem with histh pork green chili

i order a breakfast burrito describ as fill with egg hash brown italian sausag and chees drench with green pork chili and top with shred chees  actual the chili was insid the burrito so im complet not understand the sausag i substitut bacon  and there was no shred chees on top instead it  was their jalapeno chees sauc  i like the sauc but i think a dish ought to be prepar as describ on the menu  but the problem again was that it was salti to the point that a lesser eater would not have gotten it down  upon tast the compon hash brown realli salti  bacon except salti even for bacon  green chili over the top salti  had this been serv alon i would have actual sent it back and order someth els and that someth i never do  but i had a 20 gift certif so i didnt complain sinc we were realli onli pay for drinks

for the good  the menu is perfect in my book for breakfast with a nice combin of savori and sweet dish and some southwest item toss in the mix  the lemon ricotta pancak almost had me and i would still love to tri them  the servic was excel  all the staff was friend  our server was attent  you couldnt ask for more there   and the price are realli good  most breakfast dish 78 noth over 9  i just dont know that i want to consum a week worth of sodium in one meal again  but i might be persuad to come back for dinner when there might be anoth chef2 star for now i know they just open but

first of all a star for the decor and ambianc it so cute and color and comfi we were worri there would be a wait the place seem pack but were abl to snag a spacious booth overlook the kitchen this may seem like a great idea but i was abl to watch food get sent back 3 differ meal in the time we wait for our and see how long certain plate were left under hot lamp be abl to watch the kitchen in action is neat in theori but if your wellvers in the way of restaur life youll catch these problem easily

anoth star for servic our server was sweet but slowbecaus i think she was overwhelm she would disappear for long stretch as in i couldnt find her in the whole place and it took forev for coffe refil becaus they were out of glass again i dont fault her at all i think that she must have been slam everi tabl in the place was taken

th food well i order the scottsdal burrito and sub cheddar for the goat chees instead it came with no chees the menu promis hash brown insid the burritoand they were and they were frozen shred with no crisp or color to them they blend in with the egg white dammit

boyfriend order the odelay scrambl with a microscop amount of chorizo his side of breakfast potato was tasti at least whi couldnt they put those potato in the burrito everyth was just underwhelm 

the place has a gigant breakfast and lunch menumayb scale back and focus on make a smaller amount of item but do them realli well we both agre wed give them one more shot if were in the area and onli if there isnt a wait otherwis there are just too mani solid breakfast place in scottsdalthe morn squeez and no fresh squeez juic  huh

w were prompt sat at a tabl when we arriv  we then wait 5 minut befor we met our waitress  our order came out in a decent amount of time but my biscuit and gravi as well as the accompani scrambl egg came out cold  no check in from the waitress to see how the food was until i had pick my way through 13 of the cold dish  i point out what had happen and receiv no apolog just a whole lot of and i care whi attitud  she retreat into the back room and return with a zero bill for my breakfast  that nice but still no apolog  i could continu to rambl on about the remaind of the bad servic we receiv but ill spare you from have to read it all  this place is on our do not return listgod i would hate to have dietari restrict i mean i tri to eat healthi whenev possibl but raw food is just unappet yeah i know it good for me it good to eat walnut pure instead of meat and it good to eat strawberri within 12 minut of them be pick but whatev i like my food cook 

so that my attitud in general toward raw food and my review come with it that attitud that be said fresh mama is serious lack ive had their juic a coupl time and today a wrap the wrap itself juic it content all over my hand and lap let me tell you those content werent that good when they were a cohes unit they realli werent that good when they were be eaten in their part with my finger 

in short i remain unconvincunderwhelm even with a groupon
for starter this place is difficult to find by the time you see the green sign youv miss the entranc to the park lot and need to pull a uturn and then the park lot in front is a deadend so you end up have to pull back in then back out again to leave

but if your seek this place out it for their product not their park lot
smoothi and wrap sound good to me but even perus their menu onlin show me that their price were a littl ridicul wouldnt go back without a groupon that for sure

it interest to view their chang price via the pictur here on yelp less than a year ago they were 2 less for a drink or a wrap produc price havent gone up so far to justifi that but whatever

i ultim got a 24oz jungl storm smoothi their groupon deal are avail in 10 denomin but when i ask what i could add to my order they didnt realli have an answer i thought id grab a raw dessert from the refriger case but when i realiz it was 5 for a cinnamon bun that was about the size of a canlid i declin and did a coconut water instead

both drink were serv in plastic cup with plastic lid and a straw the coconut water was liter pour out of a jug and into my cup the smoothi was okay though but noth special

i get the feel this place is onli in busi becaus they are adjac to a yoga studio but even so im pretti sure the onli reason their price are so high is to turn a profit they dont seem to get much other traffic

a an addit note there were five employe present and none of them were smile happi or friend 

on the bright side despit the odd exterior the insid of the restaur is nice decor and has a giant decor tree in the middl the tabl and chair are nice appear carefullyselect and there is a lot of room to dine in if you choos to do sothis place is ador and quaint and the staff is super sweet so my rate is in no way influenc by servic or ambianc honest the ambianc is terrif and there even a charger pod on some of the tabl for our mani electron devices

i love coffe i love the flavor of coffe and espresso and i valu a delight craft beverag that highlight those flavor all thing consid i would recommend tipsi latt to someon who doe not like the flavor of coffe the syrup were so power and sweet that my salt caramel nutella latt which sound amaz right tast like sugar milk i know there are yelper out there who love thing like that so if you do keep on keepin on this place is your spot

i was also disappoint in the pastri select sinc they focus predomin on truffl which feel like an odd combin to balanc out such sweet beverag i opt for the onli nontruffl food remain which was a biscotti not bad not greathow good is it when the best thing on the menu is the peach cobbler  that definit worth tri abov anyth els  it might be even worth buy a whole tin of it  i would

i wasnt impress with the rest of it  we got 12 wing  half of it was extra hot and the other was garlic parmesan which was recommend by the person work  it had a ton of grate sawdust parmesan on top which was pretti lame  the wing were just wing  noth special to me  the bake bean side was realli good and the potato salad was decent but that doesnt equal a complet dinner  the red velvet cake wasnt as good as befor either  it was definit dri and there were no chocol chip in it like last time  

consid the atmospher of the dine area this would be an ideal place for illeg transact to go down or other thing lack like clean tabl and the fact that wing king doesnt have one of the best thing to drink with wing beer i am a takeout custom at best  

call in your order if you dont like waitwe were excit to tri a new pizza place even more so when we heard it was from the same guy at secret pizza at the cosmo realli want to like this place but it was not meant to be the mishap start when we tri to call ahead for pickup the first time we call it went to a voicemail box after sever ring with no way to leav a messag not that we would anyway we doubl check that the number was correct and that they should be open the same thing happen with the second call i dont know what possess us to tri yet again but the third time our call was answer not an auspici start what a great way to lose a lot of potenti busi from less tenaci potenti customers

w order the italian white pizza 22 and a spinach salad 7 and were told it would be readi in 30 minut i arriv about 35 minut later and was told my order was not quit readi yet as i was pay for my order i notic that they were just put my pizza into the oven wth realli i guess that a new person first when we get pizza from anywher els we are told 20 minut sometim 30 minut if it prime time on fri night and when we show up it is usual readi or occasion come out of the oven a coupl minut after arriv here i proceed to wait anoth 10 minut for the pizza to be cook and then anoth 5 minut of so for them to construct the spinach salad so basic it took anoth 15 minut after i arriv for my order to be readi for a total time of 50 minut from when i call it should go without say that it shouldnt take 50 minut to prepar your takeout pizza order even if that was accept they shouldnt tell you 30 minut onli for you to show up and wait signific longer it wasnt like they were busi i was the onli custom there until this other guy show up to pick up his pizza which they just start to put in the oven as i was leav i guess im not the onli one

w were hope that after all this at least the food would be worth the wait not by a long shot although it smell pretti good the pizza crust was undercook so we stuck it in the oven for anoth 5 minut despit this the pizza crust was quit soggi in the middl and pretti greasi throughout the broccoli rabe top was tough and the homemad sausag was noth special my wife comment that she would rather have dom demarco pizza and she doesnt even like their pizza of note they includ tini contain of red pepper flake oregano and parmesan which was a nice touch the spinach salad was even more disappoint it was line with an anem pita not includ in the salad descript and contain a relat small amount of wilt soggi spinach dress with some bacon lardon goat chees and candi almonds

wel be stick with our tri and true rocco pizza where the crust is cook proper it not too greasi the top tast better it readi in 20 minut and it even cost less 18 sorri those guy pie i just tell it how it is and youv got a long way to gostaff was veri friend said hi when we walk in the door and were pretti quick on the servic howev im high disappoint in their comp system with drink my friend play max bet video poker put in 25 buck they comp one beer she ask for anoth drink and the waitress saidwhat have you put in the machin my jaw drop then she come with a tab and charg her for the drink serious keep in mind she was still play she cash out and we left never in my life am i go back to this placewhelp

that didnt go well 

ive been to the wise sever time befor and i know folk will give me a hard time for not write about the more posit experi ive had there but in truth the servic cocktail and food have never realli blown me away and now tonight after probabl the worst experi ive had there i feel like it time i come clean madison
 
ive never understood the greetings situat i understand it a hotel lobbi restaur inform in natur but we stood for about 5 minut tonight watch staffer pass us by befor a bartend final greet us and told us to take a seat anywher in my opinion 5 minut is 5 minut too long to wait to acknowledg peopl who are about to spend money at your establish 

it got wors 

appar they ran out of grapefruit juic and instead of ask the person i was dine with whether or not he want someth els to drink as they couldnt make the cocktail he request they simpli substitut cranberri juic i dont feel like i need to expand but do feel like anytim i run out of anyth while cook or prepar a libat i will forev just add cranberri juic 

the red spread which ive had multipl time lack flavor like ani flavor it tast like cold red past not salti past that you ate when you were a kid flavorless past 

the meatloaf slider was ok probabl the highlight of our night but the even was so dismal that this highlight was more of a fade flicker 

the pop ravioli is where we lost it and felt cheat out of ani sort of decent experi cheat out of 14 i didnt realli understand the dish as written on the menu what arriv was a weird cross between a lasagna noodl and papardell appar pop ravioli mean ravioli that hasnt been cut squar fill fold anyth realli it pasta with the insid that act more like a sauc than a fill this dish would be better call lazi man ravioli or just pasta and sauc than pop ravioli which sound mild interest do i sound crabbi i am am i be fair i am becaus this like the red spread lack ani sort of flavor the dish was suppos to have fire roast eggplant and garlic and i onli know that becaus i just look at the menu onlin youd have no idea otherwis the pasta dough need to be roll out flatter befor it cut the noodl need more salt in the water the sauc slash fill slash stuff that pop out need anyth like veget spice cream chicken broth someth and the entir dish need an anchor it was disappoint and insan price given the fact that it doesnt have a protein  

the most redeem part of the even was our server who admit wasnt great at his job but he was tri more than i can say about the rest of the experii receiv a coupon to come in and tri them becaus they were open we were look forward to tri this mid eastern style place i saw the big banner say they were open we walk in and were thrown out at approxim 530 becaus they reserv the place for a parti not a soul was there and they wouldnt even let us sit in the bar my first impress wasnt a good one the woman ask us to come back tomorrow if they put a note on the door i would be more understand i hope they let you in when you make the tripi have to say for a basi that i do not like ihop denni or the like  i prefer other chain that have better qualti like good egg and cracker etc  i also like mom and pop restaur if they are excellent

mi first encount at this restaur was on a saturday morn and it was pack i was not even notic by the slow staff and decid i would tri it anoth day and left  be pack should make a statement on it own except they are fair new and like jim jone and his encamp in guyana south america peopl will flock to new or fair new venu by the hundreds

th second encount i had with this restaur was the follow monday at approxim 1230 and it was basic empti  there was one server who manag the regist as well  when i was final greet and told to sit wherev i wish of cours i did so and had to wait on silverwar coffe and a napkin for upward of 7 minut  when my food arriv it had a 3 inch strand of black hair on the plate along with the egg and potato  i was disgust and told them that their attent to onli one sit custom was poor and i was disgust with the hair on my plate so i was leav never to return again i could not wait to write the review  i eat out just about everyday and i know qualiti establish  look and see if they remain after a year or two  i doubt it  these thing tend to work themselv out with custom that are astut or aware

pay high price for egg and potato should come with an expect that they would be impecc  my omlett appear burn but sinc i did not eat it i have no idea if it was overcook burn or what

i am done  too mani restaur to choos from and this is definit off of my list to dine at despit live in the neighborhood or take ani of my guest too when they visit  i was truli hope for a great experi servic or at least food  i would have taken anyon of the threeso dissapoint by this new locat of the famili own staci  the sauc was liter an icki uber sweet  mess the price was quit high for a small portion of  medioacr bbq t
previous i have love staci on indian school but this is not the samei realli want to love this place becaus of all the hype and how close it is to the biltmor but it just didnt do much for me i order the chicken salad sandwich and the ladi at the regist said that was her favorit item i figur  you cant realli go wrong with a chicken salad sandwich plus her excit whi not it was terribl lack flavor incred dri i felt like it was can chicken salad with not much els i also order the chili with chees and onion also lack of flavor and had a bad aftertast the servic is amaz  veri friend peopl and the layout is nice as well howev the food is lacklust and itll end up be an overr deliive alway said i avoid fusion restaur i am a vegetarian and it should be easi to find someth anywher but with fusion dish it near imposs to custom or substitut entre and that creat problem for my diet and mushroom allergy

last night while arriv 45 min prior to watch perk of be a wallflow watch it i notic this place next door i have been want to tri tapa this was not that style of small plate 

mi friend and i stop in and order two individu glass of sake wine 
tri the top red option if you dine here i had the white peach meh i simpli order dessert which was the banana fritter  ice cream it was good but noth spectacular ordinari deep fri nana fruit as a garnish and a scoop of ice cream not even realli worth the 6 whi didnt i eat ani real food i onli notic one tofu dish list throughout the whole menu not veri impress and not veggi friend 
ive been to other sushi place and usual i can at best find a ramen noodl option not the case here

also the femal server was nice n all she mention  oh if you ever stop here after your movi you can bring your ticket stub and get a discount 
uh cool not help us tonight we also split the bill 2 card she charg mine twice how do you mess that up we werent even in a rush 

as the yelp rate  state meh ive experienc betterwhat the deal with the avalanch  of snowconeshav ice place in the valley   holi cow   is this due to the popular of my still fav snow ono 

i was in the area of unlv so i want to come by and tri  greet by two bum look for beer  prior to enter   nice start  i alway thought the golden rule of pan handl was hit the custom on the way out not on the way in 

go in and more employe than custom is it due to time place outsid temp under 100 degre   who know  i opt for a medium  350  and start to perus the flavor  i figur whi not go with the standard  cherrypineappl but i usual get that spray stuff that make it tart  didnt see this option  mayb it avail at the front counter  

so i figur out whi this place is call avalanch  that what happen to the ice when i start put the syrup on  the ice basic collaps   is this due to improp pack  wet ice  too fine of ice   dang if i know but it wasnt a pretti sight 

as to flavor  a littl too sugari for me

i like the concept of this place but not sure ill returni was not a particular fan of this place went on a friday even after work a friend want to tri it becaus we alway enjoy support new local places

they do have a veri larg select of beer but the process is veri confus all of the beer on tap are written on a veri larg chalkboard abov the bar they use sever differ color of chalk for each select make it veri hard to read it may be easier if they pick one color of chalk for each type of beer that way it is easi to find what you want or have 15 be one type of beer 610 anoth and so on my boyfriend spent so long tri to find a beer on the board becaus of this two of our friend were so overwhelm with the way the select were present they just ask the server to surpris them with a choic 

the acoust in the place are terribl it was so loud insid that it was hard to carri on a convers at the tabl 

also no happi hour this would be a great way to draw in an after work crowdi have been here three time and now feel compel to write a quick review

visit 1 about a year ago we were check out a new place in our neighborhood beer was great servic was soso food was not good the ambienc was loud and live super hipsterfriend and they have cool wooden tabl nice we thought but the food sucks

visit 2 gave it a second shot figur we order wrong nope food suck again i like good pub food and i like to tri interest combo like bacon  pesto thing marin in beer and gamey appet like buffalo meat or venison someth or other they have all these thing and we didnt like ani we order a few item and the waiter said they were out of sever ingredi bc they were chang their menu place was still pack beer flight was interest 

visit 3 we saw some killer pic onlin of their tv dinner and succumb to our boredom and gave this place anoth tri mayb the new menu was better or they got a differ chef or someth nope food suck again and waiter was dull and silent that a grand total of around 4 appet 8 entre and about a sixpack worth of crafti beer noth great here food wise 

tip stick to just get beer they have no ketchup onli a tomatopast thing for your friestot wait staff look like they would rather be across the street at filmbarnot impress not worth the wait not worth the price 45

after wait for an hour and a half we were veri excit to tri the food but end up so disappoint  

1st trip around everyth tast like it was left out for too long or over cook the chicken soup was good 2nd trip around everyth was coldbut the lamb chop was good

w got in at 8 pm it unaccept that anyth should be cold or tast like it been left out for too long especi if it was busi doesnt make ani sense

th dessert and servic were decent tonkatsu ramen was surpris good i dont see myself come back here anytim soon wick spoon at cosmopolitan is better in my opinionfood is just okbellagio or wick spoon is way better custom servic suck big time especi that managerlead on duti saturday night name jami and that guy ryan who was veri rude and unprofessionalthey need to take custom servic class from disney and nordstrom or better yet find anoth jobaft wait in line for 2 12 hour you guy need to know how to servic your custom betterand i am not even complain on the time we wait coz like anyon els we wait patient it just unbeliev how that girl jami can give me a remark to just leav my kid outsid how dare you say that same goe with that other guy you both need to get fired
veri unsatisfi custom hereoverr over price and over hyped

aft a three year hiatus from vega and studi a varieti of review articl status updat tweet and listen to chatter from those who enjoy this majest buffet i left unimpress sure it look cool but im not pay for an architectur tour 

price point wise it the highest it not top shelf qualiti and execut this distinct belong to wynn wick spoon and even bellagio it might be worth it if they bring their price down addit it cost me 2695 for my four year old

when i think of ani buffet im alway partial to the carv station to me this is fundament compon of everi good buffet it like when i test a great ice cream place im not fall for the gimmick bell and whistl i want to know how your vanilla tast like if it a wed i dont care about your photo booth how was your wed cake well this carv station fell short real short the prime rib was extrem dri lack salt and ani kind of savori flavor i even ask for an edg piec and it still lack ani depth the brisket was a littl better but also dri too the rib were the best good smoke ring

mayb if they didnt bother with the meat and chees spread they could have put more effort in their american station the mexican station was also disappoint the carnita were veri dri the agua fresca were the onli redeem part of that station

th asian station the dessert and the seafood station were probabl it best featur but for a bay area nativ i was not lure by their asian offer if i want seafood i would have somewher els if they had a dessert buffet option price i would reconsid returning
 
qualiti not quantiti is what lack i wont be endors it unless you have money to throw away or want to spend most of your time at the dessert stationif your prone to get seizur this isnt the restaur for you they have tv monitor onli play motley crue live show with ton of flash light it was realli annoy to see it in the corner of my eye in front of me everywher as i tri to eat

our waiter was realli nice and accommod the chip and salsa were pretti good warm crunchi chip and not bad salsa 

i got the pork enchilada 1395 and it was yummi veri cheesi and a good amount of everyth it was inhal 

mi mom got just a bean and chees burrito but she didnt enjoy it veri much

mi dad got tostada plate for 1295 and he realli enjoy it he love the guacamol but i actual thought it was kind of gross lol 

wouldnt come back thoughif you happen to find yourself at the food court in aliant station i would suggest you save yourself the hassl and skip capriottis

i hate to say it becaus i realli like capriotti see my review here httpwwwyelpcombizcapriottissandwichshoplasvegasqnicol and becaus this locat is the closest to my hous  but i have had too mani problem here that i have now decid i will either drive further if i need my sandwich fix or find somewher els to eat

of the four time i have eaten at this locat i have had problem dure three of them

1  we had a 30 minut wait for 2 sandwiches
2  we order two medium sandwich but when we got home we realiz that one was clear a small
3  we order one small and one medium sandwich but were charg for two medium  the employe notic his mistak after charg our card and said there was noth he could do except offer us a bag of chip which we dont eat  also my husband veg cole turkey was veri skimp on toppings

it a good thing i know how good the custom servic and qualiti of food is at the other locat  otherwis if this was my onli experi im not sure id bother with a capriotti again

loc in the aliant station food court next to the movi theater  note they do not sell larges sandwichafter have the edinburgh larder bistro most amaz sampl of chocol ganach at the amaz yelp winterfal wonderland event my interest was piqu and i couldnt wait to tri the restaur itself i was sore disappoint first dure yelp brunchi munchi i thought my pancak with bacon tast ok but were quit overpr for two itsi bitsi pancak and a lack of friendli on the part of the staff the restaur was attract decor and they did accommod our larg group but without much grace as mani other realli didnt like what they were served

although i realli want to like the edinburgh larder bistro becaus of their mission to serv good qualiti food made from locallysourc ingredi i was on the fenc after the brunch about whether i like this place i want to give it a second tri so my boyfriend and i purchas a groupon for a twocours lunch here sinc i work from home and his work is also flexibl we had brought our backpack with our comput with us so we could work from new town in the afernoon when we show up at our appoint time for our reserv the staff look us up and down and led us to the back room they obvious want to hide us in the back at our tabl the woman look us up and down again and after a long paus and look disdain at our bag said that other custom would be come in and sit next to us so could she take our bag to the other room sinc they would need the space she could have frame this much more tact and ask if she could help us by reliev us of our bag by take them out of our way

although thing had a rocki start i like the simpl menu of just a few item that were the fresh specialti of the day made from inseason local ingredi we both had the mushroom soup to start the soup was good and better than a runofthemil cream of mushroom soup but it wasnt too special or memor sinc we had heard about the larder bistro great bread and thought that bread would be the perfect addit to our starter we were a bit sad that we werent serv ani later dure our main cours we were frustrat to see other custom were serv bread with their soup while we had not been

for my main i had the fish while i was expect a flavour locallycaught fish i was underwhelm by the dish although it score high on present and look quit pretti it tast wasnt on the same calibr to make thing wors when i was over halfway through my meal i found a hair in my dish i didnt think it was mine but then again i wasnt quit sure i ate a bit more from other part of my plate but that was the notsoperfect end to our lunch

even though the larder bistro might had want more posh custom and we didnt seem to meet their expect they should have treat us just as well as the other custom the two older ladi sit a few tabl away or the coupl sit behind us  and no there was still no one actual sit at either of the tabl next to us the other custom were welcom warm had their coat kind taken out of their way and receiv bread with their soup we arent slob and we were a bit taken aback by the poor servic and underwhelm lunch after hear such love review prior to our visit here in the futur i hope that the staff becom more friend and care and that the qualiti of the food match the price they are charg for itwe decid to tri this place out as we had receiv a mailer for ayc dinner for less than 20 a person howev when we got there they were have a special of 1695 a person so we nix the coupon  we did have to give our inform to get the special price ie name address etc so of cours i gave fake inform  the place was a littl weird the locat next to sonic is not ideal and there is a smoke shop insid also  i have never seen a smoke shop in a sushi restaur especi in such a small restaur  

the sushi select was not expans  the ice tea tast horribl  the rice was a bit hardovercook but overal the sushi roll were edibl  the serverown was nice but a littl too curious to know how we heard of his restaur and also proceed to tell us detail about how expens rent at the restaur former locat was  it was a littl awkward sinc no one was there so we felt like our everi moveword was be watchedheard  dessert select was also not great

whil it wasnt a terribl experi i suppos i would rather pay the extra 10 a person and eat at a better sushi restaur in the areabland burger  sugari cocktail  general disappointment

i start with one of the rum swizzl made with cane  abe rum and housemad valenica orang soda  i was hope it would be super tasti but all i could tast was sweet sweet sweet  

mi biggest pardon beef is that all burger are cook to one temperatur well done  i have an appreci for a smash burger but it seem total out of place for a restaur call dlux  i decid on the farmhous burger bacon fri green tomato monterey jack with  a side of tomato jam  the patti seem unseason the bacon was overcook the green tomato didnt have much flavor and the tomato jam end up tast more like appl butter im also not sure if the patti had been seasoned

our tabl order one of each fri blue chees  bacon sharp cheddar  green onion sweet potato fri  sriracha mayo and parmesan  truffl cream fri the sweet potato fri were pretti tasti and im a sucker for sriracha  the other fri were a littl undercook but well season  unfortun the top didnt deliv  both chees were pretti mild and the truffl cream was a bit overpow 

im sorri dlux you just didnt do it for me  i love i mean love burger and i was pretti excit about some of the flavor combo but the flavor just fell flat  the food was not aw by ani mean but i was left wanthere my beef

1 these guy advertis themselv with this motto in tow burger cocktail and general swank the thing is if you have to advertis the presenc of swank in your establish there some tri too hard go on it sorta like have to explain a joke after tell it ive had to explain joke befor it not coolor swanky

2 i order a cocktail while seat in one of their booth and when the waitress deliv it there was a fli hang out in the bottom of my glass the waitress was super apologet about it when i introduc her to my dead floati friend but i was turn off nonetheless

3 tipsi cow graze merchanttheyr all right down the street and they will serv me a burger mediumrar that considerate

r talkgigi has focus it effort on onli the superfici  their market materi signag brochur packag etc are slick and glossi  that appropri for this type of busi but what about focus on the core if what it suppos to do  make great cupcak  and have a wide select from which to choose

on the sunday afternoon i stop in there where six cupcak  not six varieti but six actual cupcak  i can understand the need to avoid wast and shrinkag but six  theyr made of flour and water  how much can it cost to keep a varieti on hand

in term of the product the cake was just averag and the frost was too thick and sweet  the good news  it was pretti to look at and wellpackagafter drive by 25 time or so i decid to drop in  tri some cupcak final the girl work the counter was bubbl knowledg  help i select 4 differ cupcak a wed cake midnight chocol chip peanut butter cup  a red velvet one like a lot of dessert they were quit appeal to the eye they were veri pretti cupcak to my disappoint the cake itself was dri  not veri flavor ive had much better cake from a betti crocker box honest the frost were good but quit excess i like frost a lot  i couldnt finish it all last the were overpr in my opinion 15  some chang for 4 if im go to pay that much ill just go to sprinkl i realli want to like this place cute packag but not at all my kind of cupcak i prefer sprinkl in phoenix or better yet  crumb molli in chicago or ami bread in nyc onli three cupcak were avail and we tri banana and chocol the hershey kiss was an automat turnoff the low qualiti chocol suggest a low qualiti product the packag allow my friend cupcak to be squish which was sad the cupcak are 50 frost and 50 cake the cake is moist enough but i didnt find them good enough to be worth finish or the calorii am a big fan of sardin my goto date night restaur and marigold who doesnt want a chili poach egg for breakfast so in my world have gb move into the neighborhood felt like an earli christma present i would drive by and imagin be abl to walk home after dinner with my roommat my roommat and i would talk about our new favorit restaur as if it were alreadi open and we were regular we were friend with the imaginari bartend who work there i tri to convinc my boyfriend niec to appli for a job there i was excit realli 

first attempt
g  brovi appar aspir to the famili friend sport bar vibe great perfect style for the neighborhood i am there with 2 friend we are excit 

here the problem the menu is dumb down to the point that not one but both dinner companion pick up the menu skim flip it over to reveal no flipsid and said did they give us the kid menu both same line 

appet are almost univers fri and includ item easili access in the frozen food section at copp love wow ranch dress for dip how innov burger and sandwichesagain i can make these option realli at home on a weeknight for children who would actual eat them becaus there are no weird ingredi like veget or creativ sauc or creativ top or creativ full stop option to add weird ingredi no i understand that this is a famili orient restaur but there are burger and sandwich joint less than a mile away ahemlaurel v jac that serv kid friend food without the condescens of this menu if this restaur were unrel to sardin and marigold it would be a disappoint as it stand it offensive

mov onw order one of two nonfri appet on the menu crab dip with veggi come in a shallow wide metal dish which go figur with the dish select was instant lukewarm and congeal veggi were 3 carrot stick and 3 celeri stick cut so thin they curl look of dismay were exchang these are the same owner who serv the love fritto and chicken liver crostini no sure they can identifi an appropri serv utensil and cut the veggi thick enough to hold shape we also tri the shrimp fritter if fri is the primari menu option embrac it no meh not bad not greatth point is not memorable

at this same meal drink are order drink menu no beer on tap couldnt hear the waitress oh wait this is the one thing gb has in common with sardin and marigold except poor acoust is there at least a list of the tap and bottl beer dont have one but we have pretti much anyth you can think of by the bottl great could my friend have a crispin we dont have that ah at this point we order a round a spot cow state beverag appar gave up on the limp veggi and cold crab dip and half eaten shrimp fritter and declar a hiatus sure the restaur will improv we thought 

second attempt

waiti that a puddl of greas at the bottom of those curd and whi are they all stuck togeth darn it but no i will stay posit burger are order this is a burger joint their burger are go to be inspir in their simpl perfect  all will be forgiven ohthey dont come with a side a dixi cup of coleslaw okay sound great 1050 for a burger and side of small fri grill onion yum oh wait you put raw onion on instead special sauc couldnt find it was it that pennys dot on the bottom of the bun i cant say if it was special i couldnt tast it see previous onion issu gooey melti cheeseso passé appar the new way to serv burger is with cold unmelt chees squar mmmmm 

kid verdict float finish half a burger left uneaten this is a teenag boy the focus group has spoken

adult verdict i hate you for get me so excit for so mani month with my fantasi about my new favorit restaur within walk distanc and for then be aw i hate you for be relat to marigold and sardin and for make me expect more from you ugh

i give you two star one for the root beer the straw was cool plus noon got food poison so hey that someth one for the awesom skeleton lawn flamingo i got next door at mallattthere seem to be a cycl in new madison restaur late 

1 open your doors
2 bring in guest on the novelti factor
3 fail to offer a clean vision of what your tri to do 
4 stay afloat for a year or so perhap on strength outsid your food
5 bring in a new execut chef
6 success in all things

gat  brovi seem to be around step 2 or 3 in the cycl given that theyr run by the same folk who bring us such delight at sardin im confus at what theyr tri to accomplish out nakoma way

i the date night full lobster dinner also go to come in a red plastic basket doe my melt butter come in a small paper cup

for a restaur with all the trap of a barbecu joint the basket the low end paper napkin which might as well be wrap plasticwar the poor select of nonbeer drink there onli a faint nod toward bbq in the form of a roast pork sandwich 

im not realli sure what gb is tri for perhap they want to be a simpl neighborhood joint and i just dont live in the neighborhood mayb it didnt help that my first attempt to go was at the end of a love stroll on a monday even onli to be unpleas surpris that they were close which is a thing that restaur can do food servic can have their own weekend but there either a certain level of cuisin or a mom and pop behind the counter gb meet neither of these

neith my sandwich nor my friend was memor the waitress seem easili confus by our request and pretti much vanish at sever point i might be convinc to tri out the bar if i happen to be in the neighborhood but otherwis ill be give gb a rest for a few month to see if they make it to step 5 and 6 in the cycli realli dont get all of the great review for this place  this wasnt the worst sushi ive ever had but it come pretti close to the bottom of the list if it matter to you this is a veri korean sushi place not japanes run  complet with kpop video and a particular cute flower boy pretti waiter who look straight out of my korean drama 

servic was veri friend and sinc it was empti the food came out ridicul fast this is normal a posit except that in this case speed meant careless and sloppi sushi i got most nigiri and everyth seem pretti fresh but the rice was borderlin hard and the nori was come off nigiri and hand roll my friend fanci roll were ok but drown in way too much sauc 

one of the daili special was ocean trout which ive never tri befor but now love  it realli similar to salmon but better somehow spici tuna on crispi rice was the onli other thing id say was good they didnt have a few of the side pictur on yelp like the fish collar and noth that we tri was realli abov mediocr 

rib eye was half well done half rare japanes hamburg steak like salisburi steak was ok but weird to serv it without rice ika yaki grill squid was rubberi but not bad poor grill babi octopus skewer was just cook to hell but i like the kochujang sauc teri chicken was a big bowl of chicken w lot of stir fri veggi friend said it was ok soft shell crab tast like old oil pork belli was soft but not much flavor sear tuna with aj sauc whatev that is was a mess but tast ok uni was sweet and better than some other ayc place spici scallop wasnt spici at all and was bare even scallop  it was most mild spici imit crab 

we most came here becaus of posit yelp review along with some miscommun on which sushi place a friend had recommend we found out later that she wasnt talk about umiya unless i came to stalk the cute korean waiter i wont be back i alway forget to abid by the rule where if a sushi place has major nonasian custom you should just leav everi singl crappi sushi place ive been to i look around befor we leav and it a lot of nonasian enjoy an awesom california roll racist to saysur but it been true so far at least in my experithe skinni bland pad thai but overal okay cuisin  25 servic poor  complain about an under cook item and the restaur staff ignor the issu altogeth 1 valu although the food is okay the lilliputian size dish and exorbit price make this place a nogo for me  oh yeah  they also charg 1 for rice2

mi hubbi was scour onlin for all the new restaur that were go to hit las vega and hit on chada thai  a tapa style thai food joint open by a former employe of lotus of siam this place was on his immedi need to go list so we went on open day and i believ we were one of their first custom in the restaur  fyi  john curta just edg in befor us

now let me get this straight  im a littl leeri when someon tell me it a tapa place becaus my brain translat this to  were go to give you 50 less food  but onli reduc the price by 20 so you can share and tri more thing it a fos total cash grab market scheme of which chada thai is no except we order approxim 10 item for 3 peopl includ two 1 bowl of  rice which they charg extra for which end up be about 8216 pretip and left the restaur hungri yeah  we left fking hungri and sting gold fking brick afterwards

w order two veget dish  a grill eggplant dish and a stirfri mushroom dish the grill eggplant 8 consist on half of an eggplant marin in kind of a green papaya salad type dress the flavor combin was nice howev the grill eggplant was a littl bit tough textur the stirfri mushroom 8 consist of 23 differ mushroom with a sliver of lotus root and 1 brussel sprout mix in you heard me 1 brussel sprout there was too littl wok hai to the dish and henc the dish was swim in too much liquid the flavor was alright but noth special

th brais pork belli 8 had a nice melt in your mouth textur and good flavor howev there were onli 5 small slice of meat to go around

th kai tod garlic fri chicken was good 10 and one of the surpris more reason price item on the menu they actual gave you a larg portion of the cornish game hen the meat itself was tender while the outsid was crispi and well seasoned

pad see ew 6 was one of their better dish of the night  good flavor with some good crisp of the rice noodl their pad thai 7 though was one of the worst dish it was a littl unusu for the rice noodl dish to be complet encas in a omelet but we went with it the omelet was a littl bit tough from the overcook egg while the noodl were complet bland not recommended

w also order the steam sea bass with the plum sauc 18 which i found to be a littl too sweet for my tast i would not order this again

massaman curri 9 had a nice flavor howev was devoid of ani real amount of veget or meat in the stew liter 2 chicken drumstick half of a raw small potato and perhap half an onion

oh and about that raw potato  so we inform the managerown that the potato in the dish was raw his respons  but the chicken is cook right yes and that was it he did not offer to correct the problem or even acknowledg that it was an issu at all as long as the chicken was cook  he didnt even offer an apolog for incorrect cook food that is poor custom servic and speak to the inexperi of the staff that work there

although i appreci that we went on open night i have to say for realli hit or miss qualiti thai food i would perhap get mayb 3 out of the 8 item we order again at over the top price for the small portion i would probabl not return howev with the ad poor servic respons i would recommend avoid this place like the fking bubon plagu 2 star review

at the time we went they didnt have a liquor licens but they allow byob without charg corkag fee woop de dooi use to love kk and to keep myself in check i had one rule i could onli stop when the hot sign was on and get one origin glaze  we were drive last night on shea and i saw kk then i saw the hot sign on and scream hot sign on hot sign on so my hubbi dilig swerv around and we went to kk  i think this place is new otherwis i would have known about it  the servic was chaotic  there were onli two famili in front of us howev they were scatter all over the place and when we tri to order they told us you need to order there point at a vagu area near the window you can watch the donut be glaze  again we ask becaus there were all this peopl cram near the window  i realli dont understand whi you would stare a donut be glaze for more than 30 second the next one is go to get the same treatment then again i realli dont get nascar either but i digress by the time we order just two glaze one then we had to wait in line to pay what  i want the donut hot if i want a cold donut i would have gone to the groceri store  so my wonder hubbi stay in line to pay and i went to sit down to have my hot donut  i am glad they are smaller than they use to be i had the first bite it was ok but no wonder memori or angel sing  after we finish my mouth had a horribl aftertast  i had to stop for gelato to take the bad tast out of my mouth  i think this will be good for my hip i dont need to stop by againif i were to rate this place on the aesthet alon it would be an enthusiast five star you would not expect to find someplac this cool in a suburban strip mall the interior look sleek and modern with a lot of dark hardwood and smooth and shini bartoptabletop and huge mirror on the wall the booth and tabl were all leather and although they look minimalist in design were actual veri comfort the dim light ad to the ambianc and was veri cool look some neutral tone boxi chines lantern style light abov the tabl huge dome light that seem to be made from some kind of found object from the earli industri age and realli snazzi back light at the bar area that uplit the liquor bottl in a realli cool way and highlight the expos but tast paint black pipe and duct work run across the ceil the best part was they play some realli awesom music for us to enjoy while we ate our meal no annoy pop song or bore elev music their soundtrack could have been straight from sirius satellit radio altnat station which is the coolest radio station on the planet also it didnt hurt that the bartend and server were all young and cute although our was not particular good at her job and none of them stir an inch when we walk in the door until after we had been stand there uncertain for about 10 minutes

th food was tasti but not good enough to justifi the bill we spent 120 for the hubbi and i but the food was just ok they seem to be price themselv at the level of an upscal steakhous but they arent my husband order the 38 ny strip and said that it tast pretti much the same as the steak we usual make at home i order the maui ribey for 30 after the waitress had describ what was in the marinad i expect mani level of flavor from the ginger and various other element but realli all i tast was the pineappl especi on the sear outsid where the juic had carmel i am sure there are peopl out there who may like an over sweet steak but not me the choic for side dish were bore and unorigin various permut of the potato saute veggi etc the onli one that sound interest was the barley salad but i did not think that would go well with steak so i order the sweet potato fri and he got the regular fri we both agre wed had better fri at a fast food restaur the best part of the meal was the potato soup which was veri flavor but also a littl too rich and wasnt near as hot as it should have been when it was serv to us for the dessert we got the lemon zest creme brule which was basic just creme brule i could not detect ani tart in it whatsoever

th plus side is that they have a pretti good beer list and those were all reason price 4 or 5 i think we would come back for a light supper they did have some burger on the menu for onli 12 or happi hour unfortun their wine was also drastic overpr with glass from 7 to 14 for veri lowend wine that would retail around 815 a bottl but from 46 pm daili those would have been 5 as well so that a good thing it too bad they are so greedili tri to price goug the wealthi ocotillo resid otherwis this would have like becom our new favorit place for a nice steak dinner but with the keg just up the road whi would you spend more for an inferior meali was excit to tri this place becaus i enjoy go to town squar a coupl of my favorit store are there bebe and mac to name a few i was at a las vega chamber of commerc event and decid with my bud kamila to check it out i rememb nu sanctuari and the decor and food which in the begin were realli good well the ambianc when i walk in was ok i want to sit at the bar but we were invit to share a tabl with friend the waiter came over and was almost nice i am a wine drinker there is one chardonnay on the menu and mayb four other wine to choos from it an italian eateri so i was veri surpris i live in europ almost 15 year and the san francisco bay area more than 10 i was kind of expect a honkin wine list mayb some grappa armagnac cognac whatev the price for the wine was reason though at 7 never heard of the vineyard the waiter could care less 

two of my friend order meatbal and kam and i decid on a capres and a chop salad but the smaller version both for 595 a piec i liter got two small sliver of mozzarella and two even smaller slice of tomato no bread the chop salad was even skimpier not enough to fill your back tooth keep in mind i am 54 and 110 lbs but i eat like im goin to the chair my meatbal dinner bud ask for bread and the waiter told him he didnt order enough food to warrant have bread huh i was mortifi who say this the waiter bring out a larg dinner plate with two thin slice of hard bread i look at him like he was a car and it wasnt a ferrari 

there were a lot of guy in the restaur compar to women 15 to 1 i found the staff to be confus and arrog with the except of one girl who had no author but was gracious the other had frown and smirk and were ill train 

i realiz that it may not be a high price place howev if peopl dont line up to come back you will go out of busi faster than you can say wtf stevi d and carla pellegrino whi i ador her and i like bacio i will pay 15 for a glass of wine and a decent salad slash meal pacifi me

fix it guy or you will go under faster than you can say where the breadif you read a few of these review you will notic peopl have had a real issu with servic at this place i could not agre more

to be fair our server was extrem attent and veri friend of cours he was not old enough to serv alcohol so our beer arriv after our food 20 minut it is appar that manag has done a poor job of deleg task among the staff becaus the place was overflow with employe with the number of staff on hand there should have been no excus for the delay 

then we came to learn that this place is own by the same person who own one of the nightclub on the strip  and then everyth made sens nightclub are notori for put servic last on their list of prioriti pack them in and upsel everyth  and if they dont come back who care theyr probabl tourist anyway

honest i was not a big fan of the meatbal first of all they absolut skimp on the sauc for the size of these meatbal there was not enough sauc on ani of the varieti we tri to last through one meatbal much less two and then there are the meatbal themselv  while some peopl may like this recip i found it to be too harsh and domin by a singl spice which i fail to identifi but overpow the meatbal so much as to not tast anyth elswho those of you curious about them meatbal 

when not too sure about the time rang they are open their websit say they are open for breakfast lunch and late dining

wher locat insid townsquar right besid the amc theater

what go to and from the theater this spot alway seem to catch my eye so one night after a movi my friend and i decid to check it out my friend had alreadi gone here onc but she hadnt tri the meatbal so challeng accept 

we walk in know we were go to tri the meatbal while look at the menu i notic they were actual pretti pricey 999 for 3 regular size meatbal and your choic of sauc on top we decid to tri the meatbal sampler 6 meatbal for 1799 with parmesan cream on top 

conclusion
not ani of the 6 meatbal posit caught my tast bud  no buenooh honey honey 

honey salt was a nice restaur but i felt the lunch menu didnt give you a lot of option i realli would have love to tri some of the stuff on their dinner menu which i didnt know was on their dinner menu until our parti of 9 sat down for lunch

food  255
fri calamari  45
these littl sea creatur were light batter and fri excel the batter almost remind me of tempura batter becaus of how light the starch was the dip sauc it came with didnt pair well at all too creamy

market salad  35
although the salad had a lot of ingredi edammam chees carrot etc all of the piec were not the same size i didnt like the chees cube be twice the size of the veggi there were more salad top that actual lettuc and kale too

stil water  05
where i dine ive never been charg for water the server onli gave us two option for water bottl or still water whi the heck would you trick peopl into order water they will be charg for without tell them about it that small caraf of still water cost 4 and it tast like tap water


servic  35
servic itself was ok but the wait staff could have been a littl more attent to our larg parti that was seat right next to the kitchen 


overal  255
the best part of our meal was the compani and a plate of calamari which cost as much as an entre just say 

not sure if i would ever be back in the area sinc it way the heck off strip in las vega pass for me



yelp 100 challeng 2013  56 of 100the skinni the food tri too hard 3 servic it good servic but their menu again are decept with their unclear price structur 3 valu for the qualiti of the food they serv it realli overpr 2

i dont know whi the hub keep want to come back here in my head honey salt is tri too hard to modernizeupgrad modern comfort food classic  when there isnt much wrong with the the origin in the first place sigh okay move on

wev come back twice sinc our first visit

w came for dinner onc and lunch more recent dinner was a vast improv compar to the horribl brunch last visit see previous review so we decid to hit it up dure restaur week for lunch this week

go to this joint dure lunch is pretti much anoth episod of the housew of summerlin i swear one tabl of two probabl had enough cosmet enhanc that is worth more than a hous yup  this is the atmospher here

w notic though that they had this power lunch deal  20 for a sandwich soupsalad fri and a choic of two dessert my hub review their power lunch deal and was like great that includ their wagyu beef burger and he want to give it a shot as it was list under the sandwich you would assum that youd pay the same power lunch price buyer bewar 3 dollar surcharg on their burger option  which is bullst becaus no where on the menu doe it say that they charg 3 extra for the burger

whatev on to the food

i got the caesar salad with kale their version of a cuban and fri with a raspberri sorbet the caesar was decid okay  it wasnt anyth special  the dress didnt have enough garliclemon punch to it i also like a good anchovi kick and it just wasnt there the cubano was definit lukewarm borderlin cold the thin layer of what look like italian ham didnt offer enough salti porki good to offset the dryflavorless roast pork there wasnt enough mustard it definit need mayo and more pickl the chees wasnt realli melt on to the sandwich either to get the gooey factor overal  a pass for me the fri were okay  pretti much your standard fri from anywhere

th hubbi hamburg was okay as far as he was abl to say but the patti was definit underseasoned

th bread pud was good nice caramel and not over sweet the raspberri sorbet was noth special though and i probabl wouldnt recommend get it again

overal i think their food deserv a 3 consid the price they charg for the okay cuisin this place is over price by a long shot plus the decept price they have on their menu make this place a 2 star review i realli dont feel the need to go back hereoh the hype  i had want to like honey salt i realli did  dont get me wrong they do not serv bad food  they just serv it in flavor that are cater to palat that hard ventur out the perimet of summerlin 

upon arriv we found the outdoor dine area to be direct outsid the entranc of the restaur  they picketfenc the area and hung christma light overhead but it still seem odd to be fifti feet away from talbot a women cloth store  i do give them credit for tri though 

upon walk in the bar sit on the left and the dine area sit on the right with the open kitchen toward the back of the dine area  the decor is a relax chic  california style with a hampton twist  i like it veri much it tast done but not so much that it feel pretenti which is what seem to be what summerlin is all about unfortun  tivoli villag anyon  

we wait at the bar for our entir parti and the bartend was veri nice  i tri the garden mule and it tast like a mojito to me  it had a huge basil leaf in the drink and i am not sure if the basil was not wash proper but my drink had this pesticid tast to it  know what im talk about  i may be crazi too  i took the basil out and over time it tast better  not sure if it was the remov of the leaf or as i was finish the drink

th staff at the bar was veri nice and offer us water and all the thing a good bar offer  no problem there 

upon be seat at our tabl we were greet by casey right away  we were explain the menu and casey was extrem help with the wine select of the night  we went with the nobilo icon marlborough sauvignon blanc 2012 at the price of 43 a bottl 

now get down to busi 

the bread basket was good  noth to write home about but i must warn you about how good the butter is  bewar becaus you will want to eat the butter with a spoon  

get comfort that what they name the appetizers
w had the england fri and the octopus  the octopus was good but it was not spectacular and not for the price either  it good enough to share between two person  the england fri was noth special at all and i mean noth  i can make better shishito pepper at home  and find much better calamari and fri clam elsewher  

everyon i talk to rave about the scallop i had the scallop  for 31 you get six scallop which is more than you usual get at other place and a hand of cauliflow  the scallop were cook right not over or under cook but it was onc again unev on the palat other than the overpow truffl sauc  if you like truffl then you may find this dish fulfil  but i person like my seafood with a hint of truffl as how truffl should be 

the bf had the sea bass and as soon as the dish arriv at the tabl i knew it was go to be not good  it look dri and overcook and it tast like it  i was not at all impress with the sea bass at all  i would not recommend it unless dri fish is what you like 

one of our friend had the duck confit salad and it look bore which i person think it hard for a duck confit salad to look bore  it duck confit  i digress 

our other friend the husband of the friend who got the duck confit had the curri  it did not seem like he was ecstat about the curri  his wife actual liter said it tast like dirt  to reflect accur she did say that she doe not like indian curri  

all in all was honey salt terribl  no  it obvious has it redeem qualiti to deserv a 2star from me  i think the owner scale the flavor of the food just right for the summerlin clientel if you do not know what i am talk about mayb youll like this restaur and i encourag you to tri it  

howev i am afraid honey salt can be easili overlook for anoth trendi chic local grown restaur that seem to be sprout up in the summerlin area left and right   

i person unfortun will not be come back soonoveral my experi at gadzook was a dissappoint i had been excit to tri this place for month 

first the custom experi is extrem lack the place was so quiet there was no music no tvs just the awkward sound of echo convers from the other patron not the worst thing ever though i stare at the menu for at least five minut befor ani aknowledg then the onli word from behind the counter were what are you get for a new place a littl help guidanc or possibl some explain would be great especi when the have sever type of tortilla meat chees and sauc i dont realli know what i want yet becaus i dont understand what go on yet everon was grumpi except the gal at the cash regist 

present was not great either the ceram dish wer nice sturdi and cool quick the togo packag was realli neat as well what wasnt neat was the soup dish it was a cup like a paper cup that you put a fountain soda in uh that seem pretti ratchet no soup bowl or paper soup cup also the food along the top line was just sit in an empti steamcool tabl in what look like storag contain also they onli have 2 veri small trash can that were almost unnotic napkin straw silverwar all seem happhazard thrown in a divid next to the fountaindid they rush to open so quick that they cut a few corner it definti seem like it they probabl should have wait anoth month so that custom would have a genuin wow experience

next was the food simpli put i didnt like it i can admit that the reason for this was no fault of the establish but my own person tast it just wasnt my type they definit have some decent option but they were miss an obvious stapl beef at least i didnt see ani and as i state earlier the employe were less than help so if there was a beef option with a zani nicknam i had no idea the tortilla were either corn or a cornflour hybrid i prefer flour so they werent my favorit the rate i am give here is base 90 on my experi not so much the food

fin thought after much builtup anticip i was underwhelm when i got in and left feel hungri and frustrat hope in a few month when i give it anoth shot some noticebl custom servic improvmnet will have been madei hard ever take the time to write out a review but this experi could not go ignor i would  have much rather spent my hard earn money elsewher 

the glass that separ you and the order counter must make it hard for them to hear i had to repeat myself constant it wouldv been help to have been told that from the get go instead of figur it out at the end 

i ask for a sampl of the chicken becaus ive never been and was have a hard time order the guy look at me like i was stupid for ask i point at littl plastic contain they had by the meat and said that they must obvious give sampl he final let me tri a bit  it was a big ordeal to find out how long of a wait it was for the green chile pork to come out i had to ask him like 4  differ time if he would just make one with the littl bit that was left he act annoy for have to scoop out the meat that was left becaus it requir a bit more effort 

the ladi at the checkout was rude when i ask if i could pay while i wait for it to finish cook  she ignor us until i ask for drink cup all in all the food was ok the tortilla soup was a massiv disappoint they dont even put tortilla in it dont order it if you are a fan of tortilla soup the flavor was off the servic suck and the line is a cluster fk at least chipotl has an effici and friend assembl line i will not be return much better place to support in the areathe order process is a bit confus and when we told them it was our veri first visit and we need help know the order process they still didnt make it veri clear what all the option were  oh well we eventu sort it out  and the other review said that the menu board is poor place was spot on  as it is you have to stand back sever feet to read it and then walk up to the counter to order  it awkward becaus right after you walk in the employe are ask you if they can help you but if you are a first timer then you are probabl still stand 10 feet away look straight upward tri to deciph the menu and option  it make everyth seem rush and confusing

i order the tortilla soup and it was lukewarm as soon as took one spoon of it  i had to go straight back and ask the cashier to pleas have someon put it in the oven and heat it up and afterward it was deliv back to our tabl by a sullen employe who seem offend that i ask them to heat up my room temperatur soup  no apolog noth  serious i dont think the flame was even on under the soup pan on their stove it was that chill  

mi husband food look better and was pipe hot becaus they actual put it into their wood brick oven befor he got it  he like his food a lot i did not like mine at all  to be complet honest even if my soup had been serv at a normal temperatur it was bland with veri littl definit or textur asid from mush and almost no zip  

we both love their chip and salsa though  delicious

wel probabl be back to tri them one more time as i realli want these guy to succeed becaus i live right down the street and i love their concept but if i get anoth room temperatur bowl of soup itll definit be a major issuholi salti food batman  0o

i had dinner here on friday with my husband and toddler daughter  it was pack but not near as pack as the other restaur that we attempt to visit and left becaus there wasnt enough space for us  we wait in line for a few minut and final it was our turn to order  i shout my order to the employe on the other side of the counter over the deafen din of other peopl who were talk and eat and all the kitchen nois  it veri noisi when that place it busy

 i order 2 enchilada with the 5050 flourcorn tortilla and the short rib for the fill  i chose green enchilada sauc and cheddar chees as my top with some pico de gallo and buttermilk dress  for my littl i got her a carnita taco with a side order of the sauté spinach and mushroom and some of the same buttermilk dress on her taco  my husband order two enchilada one was spinach and mushroom fill and the other a cornbread fill  he had the red sauc on his enchilada   at the regist i ad on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband   we paid around 32 for everything

th insid was pack so we ate on the outsid patio  the patio was also veri busi and everi tabl was taken so we could onli find seat at the counter that run along the face of the patio wall  it was difficult to keep a toddler perch high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challeng but the twilight temperatur outsid was realli perfect so some of the hassl of sit out there was worth it  
  
mi grapefruit margarita was veri tasti but the food is a differ stori  i like salt i use a good deal of it in my normal cook becaus as a sonoran desert dweller we need it in our system to surviv but i can hard rememb a time where id been to a restaur and the food was so oversalt that i couldnt finish eat  that was the case on this visit my husband complain of the same thing despit the fact that he was eat a complet differ kind of enchilada than i was  our toddler onli pick at her food too i suspect it was also the sheer salti of it

th buttermilk dress on my enchilada and my daughter taco was outrag salti the green enchilada sauc across my food was crazi salti the short rib fill was heavili salt and i think there was even salt in the pico de gallo too  serious whoever is in the kitchen at gadzook need to step away from the saltshak the salti of everyth overpow the differ flavor of the dish and it was over the top  

ill tri this place one more time and if that visit goe poor then im done  this is my second tri to understand what everyon els see in this place  i was truli readi for a wick hot feast  white castl fuku burger and all the great stuff  this is such a great event and i do recommend that if you are plan to come here do so as it is a lot of fun  howev do be care  i give this a 25 star but as the cost is so high i am averag this to 2 star

1  out of town truck  perhap they are parti way too much howev this event start at 1200 noon today and some truck were not even readi set up or prepar fuku burger one of the best of the best were seen drive at noon attempt to get readi  the result is that it took for the first order we were third about 45 minut to get the food not a great result when you are third in line  not sure what happen but jogasaki sushi burrito and wa da pho were also close at the time of the open  

2 i am just say  seem that the organ red dragon have no problem to charg you 1000 per person to enter but then you get disorgan chao with these truck not even readi stand not readi and set up in the middl of line and parent of the organ get to get special treatment  on a great note plenti of bathroom and space for the line to spread out park not sure where these attend and traffic director were offici or profession or what howev everi time someon was in the wrong they would mouth off to all pedestrian and driver alik about how much of an idiot we all are  just not sure if that is a way to make for a good impression

3  food  fuku burger was veri good  had the fuku burger and the buta burger howev it was not awe inspir and gotta have it type of feel   slap yo mama had this snoop dog waffl like dish swim in some basic syrup not bad  tri their allig taco  bit of allig tail that look like chicken nugget in a basic soft taco shell with some lettuc and special sauc complet uninspir  tornado potato was a pretti cool idea these potato on a stick that look like a tornado  great tast and veri uniqu  line were decent they put a sun shield out to protect you and servic was about 10 minut  plenti of flavor  oso ono shave ice line was not busi as most were still eat and not have dessert  howev the ton of syrup they put on the ice is overpow i think less is more and to drench the ice is a bit much  the shave ice itself was like butter and so smooth  start to think about white castl but the line seem like it would take liter hour and hour about the length of a footbal field it seem and wasnt move fast

4  the yelp vip area  nice and cool that the yelper are there and have a place to sit and cool down yeah yelpers

5  retail stuff  plenti of retail shop but we did not buy anyth 

6  the ride  on the other side are all the ride and game twas quit empti all afternoon i do suspect at night it will get better

gk say check it out buy your ticket on line and skip the major line  we are go back tomorrow as we have the wrist band and we can get in and go right to the truck we want to tri  just be prepar as you will pay for this experi it cost us 4000 to get in and about 6500 for some food for the two kid and us we had about 5 thing to tri you are pay for the experi so be awar if you consid all this cost just for the food it is not econom not justifi and you are realli donat to the red dragon financi pockets

stil check it out just put it in perspectoh foodi fest how you broke my heart this year 

i have been in past year and was use to the idea of pay 10 to get in and then pay the truck for their food truck ambrosia delight at their regular full price i wont spend a lot of time on the cost factor but will mention the truck should make smaller portion at reduc price so those peopl like myself can tri a littl bit of everyth 

this year i have to give prop to the slap yo mamma truck and their gator taco they were delici 

fukuburg a normal 5 star truck disappoint us by serv our burger bloodi and under cook on the first night 2nd day the burger were cook to perfect but then they were out of naga dog it was the first time we were ever disappoint with this truck

th daughter love the fri candi station dont know how she live with me and i never expos her to deep fri rees peanut butter cup or twinki but we had to get back in line for more of those

w also couldnt find fri pickl anywherewher oh where were you redneck kitchen

rid were a littl expens but still the best part of the foodi fest how sad is that you are at a food truck fest and the sub parov price ride were the best part of the event

al in all it was a horribl experi this year and i hope the silverton bring back the group that put it on in year past as this year they fail miser in my humbl opinionwe were plan to have a movi and dinner night  i was also crave for some escargot so we end up in aliant  i was excit to have a french restaur close to home  

so we order escargot and got osso buco  i was torn between croqu monsieur and steak frite becaus those were some of my favorit when i went to pari  the escargot was all sort of weird  escargot onli has a few compon snail garlic clear butter and sometim parsley  their version had all sort of garbag tomato pancetta creami butter mushroom and yeah snail  i was extrem disappoint but i was hope my entre would be better

know this was at a former station casino i decid on get steak frite becaus that would be hard to mess up  boy was i wrong  i like my steak medium rare  they serv me a dri welldon piec of carcass  i was go to suck it up and eat it anyway but the friend insist i get the right steak the way i order it

th osso buco with risotto was sadlook  it was a brown lump of blah with a petrifi rosemari twig  it wasnt as tender as it should be  we were alreadi done eat by the time i got my second steak  this time my beef wasnt extra dead   the steak frite was edibl but not good  ive never had steak i didnt finish or take home until last night

th servic was great  our server kris was polit and help  the manag came to our tabl to apolog for the steak mishap and comp our creme brule  if this review was just base on food alon id give them 1 star but they get a bump becaus of the service

thi place use to be an italian restaur and shouldv stay that way  bistro 57 call itself europeaninspir but the food was absolut uninspir  i wish i could say the food was forgett becaus believ me id rather forget i ate herei still dont know whi peopl are so in love with this chain i went onc for their one slice for chariti and didnt like it but i thought i would give them anoth tri for real this time

i wasnt surpris by the still mediocr food give to us first off the cheapest larg pizza this place has is 17 that just for a chees pizza and it goe up to near 30 for specialti one luckili we came here dure their half off time which is near everyday at a certain time it should be a warn when a place has  half off their food near everyday  it is ridicul to pay full price for this food

it veri bland in my opinion the sauc tast like glorifi ketchup and the chees is tasteless the garlic knot were onli good becaus of the cheesi powder they are cover with but again the sauc that come with them is not veri good i hear a lot about the crust but i dont see what peopl crave about it 

servic was alright there were onli a few tabl occupi which is strang sinc this place is so big and so popular and we wait a long time to be seat and serv 

overal this place is ok if you pay half price 8 for their cheapest pie but other than that you wont see me herethe yard look amaz the concept is cool and that about it 

sad after three visit ive decid to take this spot out of the rotat but whi you ask how could i with all the cornhol and ping pong and beer and whatnot welp ill tell you

th servic is complet crap 

everi time we wait forev get attitud from the staff and have even experienc dirti glass and cold food onc i order a red stella this is a simpl concoct of stella artoi and bloodi mari mix i order it all over town and get it serv up perfect not onli did they not know what it was here they refus to mix it insist i get a shot of bloodi mari mix on the side it wouldnt mix up proper like that and my beer was warm i complain and the server roll her eye at me 

mi friend got a dirti greasi glass with her jameson and soda 

our overpr fri and burger were ice cold in the summer in phoenix this is no easi task my friend 

final we wait over an hour to play cornhol when a spot final open up the dude play befor me just hand me his bean bag i had no idea i had to actual rent them i got yell at by a bouncer who snatch up all the game equip and insist i go provid my driver licens to reserv them i had no problem do so but by the time i had finish wait to speak to someon at the regist they said the spot had alreadi been reserv by someon els and id have to wait for anoth one to open up 

thank but no thank three strike and your outwe know the fox is clever the restaur concept they come up with are like littl magic yellow brick down the yellow brick road that is lead by the peter piper and when one open peopl gather
i love the concept of the yard group seat plenti of game to play    and there were plenti of group there  
now i know fox is deft and ani restaur is all about maxim the potenti for the almighti drink and serv of food  
unfortun at the yard servic of food and drink fail miser  there were a larg group of us elit yelper there with our friend celebr some dec birthday    yet there werent enough seat and i serious stood there for almost 2 hour and not onc did a waiter come by and ask me if i want anyth to eat or drink  and i was more than readi to order someth to eat and drink
al those potenti loss of revenu i saw all around me  im think if they would do the order and deliv system differ the night intak would certain doubl if not more
i dont know what the solut is but if i were fox i would send someon foxi and braini to spend some time to analyz the situat and come up with a procedur where the plenti patron are servic becaus at the end of the day you are still run a restaur and not a free playground for the grownupi so bad want to love this place  the concept of have a restaur and game area inclus be a support of bicycl and liter right around the corner from my resid sound like the perfect neighborhood bar 

howev i am disappoint in the servic everi time i go watch paint dri is a faster process than order a cocktail and the bartend seem more interest in each other than the custom i love the cocktail name room servic but i onli had time to order one befor my bill came at midnight i show up at 1030  then i was charg for 2 drink on my tab im not sure what their hire standard are but ive gone to the yard differ time of the day and have been utter disappoint in the servic everysingletim it realli is quit a shame  if they are go for a hipster version of dick where they treat everyon like crap as part of the experi then i wish i would at least get a papermad hat with a clever say on itsure go ahead charg me a mandatori 20 gratuiti without ani mention parti of one howev it go to cost you my busi i refus to eat anywher with mandatori gratuiti especi with no disclosur gratuiti is suppos to be a reflect of the servic rattlecan custom are go to find rapid decay servic after all whi tri hard  also i general tip 20 for good servic but i believ the standard is still 15 
it too bad becaus the lvs fri were pretti good 
howev when i ate dure the nfl playoff game they had the sound blare dure the commerci it was intoler loud i had to leav as quick as possibl i couldnt take it i onli ate half my dish 
failthis is a review of the happi hour

th skinni underseason and underwhelm although they give you big portion in this case it isnt a good thing 2 servic  stink wors than the food 0 valu edibl food but noth spectacular shoddi servic make this place a 2

we came here to tri their happi hour becaus we were entic by their rather extens half price bar menu

norm when it come to happi hour we make it a point to sit at the bar becaus the bartend is right there offer you servic at this joint the bartend couldnt give a st

he bare acknowledg us as we sat down after spend a good amount of time fetch 2 glass of water he was too busi flirt with 2 skanki look chick at the end of bar he neglect to provid a menu i had to sneak one away from our neighbour 

bi the time he return we barrag him with our menu select becaus we didnt know when hed come back from infin and beyond then he ask us are you sure you dont want a margarita 

pet peev rant if i want a fking margarita id have order one end of rant

real we werent go to order booz he pretti much ignor us we had to ask for everyth  from more refil of water even when our empti glass were in front of his face to fking cutleri dont even get me start on him lift out heavi bin of dirti dish and not wash his hand oh and it took at least 10 minut to find him to print out our check

at one point the bar was complet unman for at least 6 minut a bunch of server were huddl around the drink order area wait for their drink to be made yup the bar area  major clusterfk and let face it the restaur was perhap 25 capac mayb 40 custom and that be freak generous

th bartend actual had the gall to say just as he hand us our check which he final got around to print out sorri about the poor servic tonight we just got slam by whom i wonder becaus the joint wasnt even hop 

in a way that was total a dick move to tri and garner sympathi he knew that servic was shoddi but didnt realli acknowledg it until he realiz that he was go to get a stti tip sorri douch  you still got a shitti tip anyway hes lucki we left anyth at all

on to the foodw order the fish taco 3 taco 13 regular price the taco al pastor 3 taco 11 regular price the steak flatbread 2 larg portion 11 regular price  and the ahi tuna taco 3 taco 9 regular price portion size in general for their bar menu is rather generous howev given the lower qualiti of their food larg amount is not a boon at all

w sampl their chip and salsa our server just plop them on our tabl so i had no idea of what kind of salsa it was the warm one is better than the cold one but neither one was truli worth mention their chip are on the thinner varieti and need some salt

ahi tuna taco were pretti bad the fish had a weird sweet to it that was singularili unpleas encas in a taco shell made soggi by the wateri flavourless green slime masquerad as guacamol i believ this was definit the worst dish of the night

th fish taco had a veri skimpi portion of fish in it or mayb becaus there are too mani freak slice of red raw onion to actual identifi that there some underseason fish hide in there textur uninterest it definit need more cabbag to add some crunch it was just terribl bland and not veri interest dish

taco al pastor are not legit it look like chunki stew upchuck instead of the roast pork on a spit if that wasnt bad enough the pork was as desper flavourless as the fish taco mix in the grill pineappl wasnt go to save it it was pretti mediocre

th flatbread de bistek was the onli thing that was truli palat that night the steak actual was season and the flatbread was crisp  almost like a thicker cracker it definit wasnt anyth astound but at least it was okay but as finger food it realli messi to eat without a knife and fork 

overal given the stti servic and the okay to thevergeofnasti food i have no inclin to return i was serious debat about given this place a 1 star review howev the food was bad but wasnt complet ined for that this joint squeek by with a 2 star reviewi should know better than to go out for upscal mexican that like go out for fanci chines food  99 of the time it lead to noth but utter disappoint cantina laredo was no except it a great look spot in tivoli villag with a cozi patio but the servic and food were a letdown

i heard guacamol is made tablesid except mayb if your dine on the patio our order was hastili drop off by anoth serverfood runner it wasnt bad and was a larg enough portion to feed four tuna taco were ok but surpris bland minus the guac and red onion the casarita margarita tast water down and wasnt near as strong as it should have been my wife salad suffer from mushi mango and soggi green but at least the shrimp was good

i was happi to hear that i could mix and match a taco platter unfortun these taco made me crave one found at much cheaper taqueria taco el gordo anyon the barbacoa was my favorit with it smokey flavor the carnita wasnt ani better than what i can make at home and the al pastor was averag they would have been good come from a home cook but from an upscal restaur i expect more

our server may have been busi but slow servic is slow servic we didnt get napkin and silverwar until after our appet show up  and we had to ask for them no offer to refil our drink until after we were done eat our server vanish after we got our food and didnt show up until fifteen minut after we were done eat there may or may not have been a good reason for the poor servic but it was bad enough to creat a negat dine experi and forc me to do someth i havent done in a coupl year give less than a twenti percent tip and ultim it mean there zero chanc of me returnour meal were ok and servic start out well and then went downhil  i should have paid more attent to the review of my two friend on yelp  live and learn

w were here about 415 yesterday afternoon and there were veri few peopl there  we were seat immedi and brought menus and drink  the chip and salsa were brought and our server explain that the warm salsa was spici and the cold salsa was not spici  the chip and spici salsa were good  the chip are veri thin and i found i broke sever in half dip them in the salsa

for our dinner i order the taco al pastor  here the descript from their menu  spici pork with pineappl pico de gallo and cilantro  my wife order the tampico which is describ as grill chicken breast top with sauté artichok heart mushroom spinach red bell pepper with sour creampoblano sauc and monterey jack cheese

mi taco were just ok  the biggest problem with them was there was onli one taco  when i get taco like this at genuin mexican place theyr alway doubl so there some bodi to help hold the fill  with my taco and the singl shell the pico was wet enough that it soften the taco and made it almost imposs to pick up to eat  i did eat the first one that way but i was awash in juic  the pork was ok but the spice was a heavi coat on the pork  it was spici but other than that there wasnt a whole lot to recommend the taco  i also thought of the al pastor ive gotten from street vendor on east charleston for a fraction of the cost i paid  stupid me  with my taco came rice and black bean  my wife like her chicken and it was as describ  it the kind of dish you might get at ani texmex kind of restaurant

dessert was the star of the night  i got the très lech cake and she got the mexican browni  my cake was excel  her browni came with a bit of tabl side ta da
th browni was place on a veri hot cast iron dish safe in a recess wooden holder  then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the browni  last the sauc was pour over the ice cream and when the sauc hit the hot dish it bubbl and made a kind of extra butteri syrup that ad to the flavor of the browni and ice cream  

now to servic  up until the time we got our meal everyth was go along fine  then our server disappear  she came back onc and ask about the food and then was gone again  10 minut after we finish our dish she was nowher to be found  the host look at us sever time and it seem as though he was go to get her at one point but that was not the case  final she show and we ask about a box and ask about dessert  she said shed get the dessert tray and be back

again she was just gone  about 5 minut later anoth server stop and ask if we want a box  we told him wed alreadi ask for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the dessert we made our choic with him  a few minut later our server and this second person arriv with the dessert  she stood by as he did the tabl ta da for the browni  then she left again  about 6 minut later she came back with the check and just put it down  

when i finish dessert and we had some time to relax and talk i got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 second she was there to pick it up  wow speedi gonzal then but not at the need time  

i realli like tivoli villag and there are some other restaur there that i have yet to tri  but cantina laredo wont be one of them  we have so mani small place along east charleston that there no reason to ever go here againbelow averag taco at best each one was about 179 you might think that a good price until you tri them the carn asada was bland dri and the qualiti of the meat was poor the al pastor was better but also dri my expect for the pork were high when i say the meat on a spit but it doesnt come close to al pastor at other place around townmy mistak for check this place out befor check their yelp rate i had it bookmark when they first open and never thought to check back to see their review we came here today for lunch and was hope to make pepe a new regular spot on our food rotat in the area 

i order the carn asada gordita and it was ok but the gordita was realli doughi and not as crisp as i would have like my fella got the huevo ranchero and they didnt look too appeal we also tri a taco al pastor just to check it out and it was dri and not flavor at all definit a lacklust experi and i dont think ill be back 

the salsa bar wasnt great and most of the food didnt look or tast as fresh as you hope for this was a disappoint dine experi compar to so mani other optionsmall taco high price and dumb polici tri reeeeal hard to be nice and give them that second star

i was here a few month ago but drunk out of my mind and i couldnt have written my yelpworthi review base on my tipsi experi i decid to stop by the other day and i guess you have to be drunk to realli appreci this place

loc off flamingo and rainbow pepe is a 24 hour tacomexican fast food spot in the same vein as roberto they have about 6 or 7 differ type of meat for their taco along with plenti of burrito combo plate and other standard mexican offerings

th taco were small and at about two buck a pop definit not worth it they onli use one small corn tortilla so everyth get soggi and fall out on the plate  booo the carn asada was lack in flavor and a littl dri likewis the chorizo was noth memor the salsa bar was a disast when we came in the two wateri sauc they had were splash all over the place ad littl flavor to the taco 

what realli disappoint me about pepe were their stupid polici 50 cent charg for use a credit card 30 minut limit for eatingin and they even had the nerv to post  sign on the soda fountain about extra charg if you are caught share a drink all these rule and fee make eat their mediocr food more of a hassl than it should be

if you are look for an authent taco hit up taco el gordo better taco cheaper price no stupid rulewant to tri this place for the longest time sinc i was in the area and it was bookmark i figur hey whi not

ord a chees quesadilla was way too much chees dont get me wrong i love chees but there was so much greas it was  gross the flour tortilla was soak and my toddler wouldnt even eat it becaus she didnt like how greasi her finger were

next were the taquito which were super crispi which normal would be awesom but there was almost no meat insid i couldnt tast it at all fri to noth 

it would be a one star if the red sauc wasnt so goodlike most everyon els that end up here i had a groupon  it was a realli good deal and i figur how bad could it be so we walk in w low expect hope to be pleasant surpris ill say it was probabl worth the 75 groupon deal but we still wont be back and id honest be piss if i had paid full price 172 

so i guess this place close temporarili and just reopen w all new staff the menu is also slight reduc from what on their websit no more escargot banana foster some of the salads

calamari was pretti good but that pretti hard to eff up french onion soup was ined salti lobster bisqu wasnt bad  lot of lobster bit w the soup pour tabl side prime rib was decent my rib eye was order medium but arriv well done they brought a new one out pretti quick probabl becaus this one was way rare i was debat whether to just eat it figur they would overcook it again but the waiter saw how raw it was and took it back it came out close enough to medium  season fine i like the char bit definit not prime qualiti like the name say but the steak was ok creme brule was standard their appl strudel wasnt at all strudel and it suck w mushi overcook appl and way too sweet crust 

server was just ok but i love the busser vladimir  he was super nice and attent the entir time my friend drink water like a mofo and his glass was never even half empti 

so yeah i wont be back but i guess it was worth the 75 for 1 appet 2 soup 2 entre 2 dessert  we left 35 tip off 172 origin total and groupon had 10 off purchas over 30 so have spent a total 110 w tip and a cocktail is fair 

i agre w everyon els  this place wont be around much longer so if you get the groupon use it quick and it doe have a realli odd smell  it wasnt realli insecticid like other said we couldnt decid what it was and the peopl next to us ask the manag said it was rosemari no clue wtf it was but it wasnt effen rosemarii dont drive up and down w tropicana ave that often so it is not surpris that i have never notic that a taco truck would be oper in the park of showtim car wash on select even  on a recent saturday i was here to check out this new to me west side taco truck as part of an organ street taco crawl around las vega with mani other yelpers

th food truck overal look new and kept clean  the two man crew make the order to order are pros and kept up with the yelp rush like no bodi busi look over their menu i notic that their price is probabl tie for be the lowest for their taco almost everyth is 150 except lengua tongu and tripa tripe which are 2 a piece

a the event is bill as the al pastor tacolymp it was a no brainer that i had to order an al pastor taco with pineappl  i also order their cabeza cow head meat taco as i was pretti hungri just to round it out but still forc myself to not order ani more so i can pace myself for the rest of the pit stop we were expect to make if we kept to the plan

th wait for my order of the taco was minim and was readi sooner than i had expect  the al pastor taco look good but the pineappl seem like it wasnt grill at all the cabeza taco look just okay  but the main test was the tast test and the al pastor seem lack in flavor and the cabeza was rather dri  their salsa and condiment bar help but overal i was not impress at all

whi you should check this place out assum it is open at this locat on the night you want to check them out  the main reason would have to be your immedi proxim to this locat and their price  otherwis get in your car and drive ne to other taco stand that offer mucho better taco for 50 cent more

besid taco they of cours also offer burrito torta and quesadilla on their menu for someth to wash it all down they have your typic bottl water can soda and their horchata

oh expect to stand and eat or go a bit more upscal and enjoy your taco in the comfort of your car  what ever you decid just be courteous to other and dispos of your trash in the provid trash receptacl 

park is where you can find a spot on the street or in the lot as long as you are not obstruct traffic

review 13 of 2014nicol l         where do i even begin

so the onli reason i went to longhorn was becaus of your amaz review it was my best friend birthday so i thought might as well take him to an amaz perfect cook juici tender qualiti steak dinner

pretti easi to find as it right on alma school which is liter right down the street from my place in dobson ranch park lot was pretti empti so it was a good sign that there was no wait and we would be abl to get attent servic or it was a bad sign of thing to come howev i like to stay positive

w walk in and there isnt a hostess to be found it pretti dead mayb 3  4 tabl occupi that was scatter thru out the restur while wait to get seat im get my hope up becaus of your review and how legendari im hope this meal will be you gotta understand that this was my first real steak restur that i have been to after my 4 month journey in southeast asia where they usual dont eat steak so again we were onli there base on your hype up 5 star yelp review after a few min we get seat by an actual server rather than a hostess

ther were 3 of us we were all veri extrem nopah sinc we were there for steak and for a birthday celebr the decis was made for the biggest rib eye for everyon so we all went with the outlaw ribey medium for the ladi and medium rare for the men from their menu outlaw ribey  we call it this becaus it would be a crime if you didnt tri it it is one of our favorit becaus of the combin of juici marbl and firegril bonein flavor 18 oz 2249

after order we get the infam longhorn bread i am a huge bread and butter fan and can destroy a few loav all to myself howev the bread was hard and seem stale so we bare touch it

w final receiv our entre and were readi to eat have perfect cook juici tender qualiti steak in mind this was a huge disappoint mine was cook to medium my gf was cook to medium well and the birthday boy was cook to medium rare the medium rare steak was juici but not tender the medium steak wasnt juici or tender but the medium well steak wasnt so juici but it was tender

al in all it was a huge disappoint servic wasnt the greatest but it was pretti averag food qualiti was below averag valu isnt there total bill after tip and tax was about 92 we would have been better off go to texa roadhous on stapley

mayb i just came on an off night but corpor place like this should have a level of consist but to me it was just a wast of 92i am a season pizza eater  and i mean pizza eater in itali  the concept for this restaur is great the execut is dismal  the pizza maker admit they did not know what they are do  i found it frustrat tri to explain to him the differ between what the classic pizza vs the margherita pizza ingredi were list on their menu  how good your pizza is depend on which of the pizza maker make it otherwis you will end up with a soggi and thick crust limpi pizza  

the pizza was also veri salti the guy was v heavi hand with the salt better to ask for no salt and add yourself

mi recommend to anyon who realli want to tri this place  watch first who make good pizza and make sure that is the guy who make your otherwis you will not be happi   

overal the employe were not train  they didnt seem to care about the qualiti and output of what they were make  i guess im a spoil vega nativ turn ny who happen to be lucki enough to make at it to itali at least onc a year to have authent pizza and neopolitan pizza this doe not measur upthis is realli a meh ive experienc  better 

noth fanci to write about i order my usualan ice coconut latt with nonfat milk and sad i was disapoint my coffe drink tast water down didnt have much of a coconut tast to it and definit didnt tast ani coffe onc again water down it kind of had an after tast like some sort of tea flavor 

glad i bookmark this and had a chanc to tri this out wasnt to my like so it okayther are plenti of other great coffe shop no im not talk about starbuck here in las vegathe menu look so promis it got us to give burgr a tri with it dress up burger at pretti reason prices
 
 i cant decid if it was the servic or the food that i found less impress the hostess was super friend and the person help our server was nice but our server was off put he ask where we were from and when we said we were local he respond with how the local hadnt been good custom tonight and ask us whi we would have come out to the strip if we live here as if wed made a mistak turn out he was right 

 we order drink and the jalapeño popper a burger a hot dog and onion ring 90 with a 20 tip we had to ask for water while eat the popper and did so onli after he ask if we want anoth round of booz 

he came and check on us when we had food in our mouth and said he alway doe that so peopl cant complain if the servic and food were good that would be a cheesi but accept joke as it were it was ironi 

 the popper were decent they were much bigger than we expect they were serv individu in shot glass with dip sauc at the bottom which was probabl whi they were cold by the time you finish 

the britannia burger was incred bland and surpris small if you have a healthi appetit you will definit want to order a side 

 the hot dog was serv in what look like fold in half french toast it was impress to look at but when my girlfriend tri to eat it it reveal itself to be awkward and the tast didnt make it worth the effort

 the onion ring how can you screw up onion ring right no serious how did you manag to make onion ring that were so unapp that we didnt eat them

 the server came back to ask if we want desert with the check alreadi in his hand and never came back to collect it thank we had exact chang it pretti obvious to me that the local not treat him well was becaus they werent look through vacat goggl that make everyth seem great becaus you know vega babi 

it also obvious from his approach that they dont realli expect repeat clientel but that ok becaus even if the servic had been great the food wasnt so there realli isnt ani reason for us to go backsad to say but my recent visit to burgr was absolut disappoint it less than a year sinc my previous visit to burgr and im surpris how dramat the qualiti has gone down ive had great experi the first coupl of visit last year when the place just open and rave about it to my friend  bf my bf final got to tri it and im mad at how bad the experi was for us we came mother day weekend and i have no idea what was up w the restaur that friday night

w both got the hell kitchen burger w a fri egg with ad duck breast bacon and i had to get my burger recook four time even on the 4th tri it still wasnt what i want and my bfs burger wasnt what he want either the custom servic was crap that night too compar to my previous visit i order my burger medium and 2 time it came out medium rare the third tri it came out practic well done  dri and they forgot the duck breast bacon 4th tri it came out medium well  i got tire of send it back to the kitchen to get it redon so just settl plus i was get full from eat the fri while wait  my bf order his burger medium rare and his came out veri rare normal he is fine w rare thing sinc we eat steak tartar and all but this burger patti look gross there was like blood from the patti ooz on his plate serious it look like all they did was throw the patti on the grill then flip it realli quick and serv it he didnt even finish the burger onli took one bite and left it there he didnt wanna send it back to the kitchen to have it redon caus he felt bad sinc mine had to be redon so mani time also our whole tabl agre that the patti didnt tast season at all ive had this burger mani time befor and serious it did not tast like how it use to be how do you forget to season the patty

in despit of all this our waitress didnt even offer to comp the poor made burger i was realli sad that the burger and servic arent as good as my first coupl of visit when they had first open not sure if they had an off night but i would think theyd be consist w qualiti servic and food first impress mean a lot and my bf was so disappoint he doesnt even think it worth come again to give them a second chanc the onli good thing that night was the milkshak and fribloodi hell you cant even cook a burger properly
 after a visit to burgr i have lost so much respect for the hardbal no bs when it come to food and servic celebr chef ramsey burgr at planet hollywood was actual quit a joke i cant believ chef would put his name on an establish that has less than stellar servic big problem in the kitchen rundown décor and honest margin food  

the joint no reserv so be prepar to wait in line it appear long howev move quick the restaur space is jam pack with tabl seriouslyelbow room onli so tabl steadili open up burgr is well worn  i can understand a littl wear and tear here and there but the placemat were tatter cloth napkin were fade plate had half of what use to be the burgr logo on them and the paint floor were worn down to the concret in sever areasdefinit in need of a face lift 

now onto the import part  the food
husband had the farm burger with duck breast bacon sharp english cheddar chees top with a soft fri egg 
i order the euro burger with truffl aioli goat chees arugula and oven roast tomato 
side order of just fri serv in a larg metal cone with curri and chipotl ketchup 

where to start food was deliveredston cold hubbi burger had die in the window glare obvious by the congeal cheddar chees and hard cook ice cold like cold from the fridg egg mine burger was room temp at best and despit the fact that we each order differ cook temp on our burger medium and medwel respect they both arriv welldon  we inform the waitperson veri love gal and she offer to reorder we were alreadi an hour and a half in and had plan so we declin  

the general manag joana holtey came to our tabl  offer a reorderagain no thank she was veri apologet thirti second later joana return with anoth egg on a platethat was cold haha obvious they are precook egg in the kitchen ridicul two minut later joana deliv a perfect cook fresh eggbi then half the burger had been eaten  two comp beer to go and the offer to return and give anoth comp tri were much appreci but sad the damag had alreadi been done and we had other plan for the rest of the week 

i think it import to note that burgr might have been have a particular bad night prior to us order we had a convers with the coupl sit next to us about the issu they had with the farm burger  same overcook cold egg they sent their back 3 time and eventu just left without eat two peopl sit behind us three peopl sit to the left us and one person at the tabl in front of us all sent plate back wowza and that just what we notic in our littl area of the restaur not good gordi not good at all im go to heed the same order you so often give dure hell kitchen and tell myself to f offon this person wont be come back so disappointed

oh i almost forgot  there was a person walk around the restaur offer to take group photo for sale realli tackinosh  swig was pretti empti when we pop in on a sunday afternoon for lunch we were shock with how dirti everyth was the tabl had clean rag on them there were crumb all of the seat and in the nook and cranni like it had been there for month and there were stapl come out of the damag seat asid from be just yuck i was worri that my 4 year old would get poke by the slew of rag loos stapl hang out of the upholsteri 

the food was just mehnoth to write home about but it was definit kid friend minus the seat issu lot of heavi heavi food item and what we order didnt seem that fresh the servic was decent if not a littl slow 

overal bummeri was hope this place would be a fun new modern tapa place for me to frequentso i have eaten at this place twice and the reason i give it 2 star is primarili the atmospher and veri friend staff the ambienc is cool fresh and bright the staff is veri attent and nice 
now to the food veri mediocr had a hard time believ it was on the food network the wolfpack was just a plain tast meal and the second time i went i order chicken fri steak the gravi was sooo bland i scrape it off the meat the home fri were also kind of lacklust compar to other breakfast eateri in gilbert such as liberti market or the farmhous just as exampl 
what realli had me mif on the second visit my friend and i sat at the bar short after we arriv anoth coupl sat next to us we all wait about 20 minut mayb a littl more for our food but the coupl that sat next to us got their meal paid for bc of the wait and my friend and i didnt we wait just as long and also had a singl item each just didnt seem right but all i can say is that i have no imnmedi plan to return i believ two chanc is enough especi after this incidthe skinni unbalanc flavor and season miniscul portion size mar angelo sosa new restaur 2 servic attent but with some misstep 3 valu given the soso to mediocr offer and the exorbit price this place is a big fail 2

we ventur off for poppi den with a friend of our on their open day for lunch suffic to say this joint live up to it inauspici name poppi den who in their right mind would name an asian inspir restaur this after what the british did to turn generat of chines into opium addict zombi wtf

anyhow colonialist aspir asid we were seat prompt and shown to our tabl we order the market salad with soytruffl dress 7 aunt carmin fish fritter 11 amma homemad tomato soup 7 poppi burger with fri 11 grandma style roast chicken 15 steak and potato 18 we also sampl two dessert  the chocol molten cake and the strawberri sake shortcake

th market salad 7 can onli be sum up in 1 word  weird there was a littl too much basil which pretti much overwhelm the other subtl flavour of the mix green the boil egg thrown on top realli didnt make ani sens  such a heavi item has no place amongst delic leav ad to the fact the heavi addit of a realli unbalanc dress over tart and salti this was a massiv fail

amma homemad tomato soup 7 didnt arriv as hot as i had hope serv it in such a shallow bowl made it cool off rapid which didnt help the soup overal was too sweet for my tast it was kind of like dilut ketchup with some curri flavor mix in

aunt carmin fish fritter 11 was perhap the highlight of the meal nice and crispi on the outsid the fish mixtur marri well with the aioli it was serv with unfortun the cost of the dish was rather high consid the small number of fritter served

th poppi burger 11 flavor was good but there are some major issu with the dish becaus we were share amongst three peopl the hub cut the burger into 4 equal serv size but what is this when he cut the burger into quarter  one quarter had no burger meat in it i repeat  no burger meat in it that meant that the burgerbun ratio is about 34 that a sucki ratio becaus when you bite into a burger you want to get a tast of everyth not just the bun 

the fri were the thinner varieti with a small sprinkl of togarashi on top they were okay but noth special the kimchees was alright  we ask for on the side becaus we didnt want the sauc to mar the crispi of the fri but noth that i would say id specif yearn for again  it was more of an aioli than a chees sauc per se

grandma style roast chicken 15 it a fking insult to a person intellig to put such a dish under their suppos larg plate this is not a larg by ani mean realli the portion size for the chicken is about 14 of a boneless thigh off a regular size chicken i am not stting you  it is that small serv with some pickl veget i fail to see how anyon except an 6 month infant would consid this a meal the actual prepar of the roast chicken was okay and edibl but given the price it ought to be much more than this

steak and potato 18 was onli ok textur a littl tough we were veri underwhelm by this offer serv with a bland au jus and togarashi season potato it was definit forgettable

fin dessert  we tri both the strawberri sake shortcak and the molten chocol cake the strawberri sake shortcak was overwhelm by the oversatur of the spong with larg amount of sake not good the chocol molten cake was veri good  nice and gooey on the insid but again for the price small

overal i want to love this place but there are too mani flaw with the dish to warrant a return visit even if this place were half the price and doubl the serv size you just wouldnt come back to a restaur that fail on so mani level of flavor and textur sorri  2 star reviewwent on saturday jan 19 2013 

given the rough review of late we decid to give it a tri anyway as my famili root for angelo in top chef to keep it brief we found out he wasnt cook and was in nyc i want to give them the benefit of the doubt given it onli been 19 day sinc openingth staff was run around give food to tabl that didnt order the foodour food was either waaaay too salti or under seasonedit was comic almost some good pointsour server was nice and we were comp 13 of our meal and apolog to by the maîtr d numer time but the bad realli shadowednoeclips it 

when you go youll be greet by a larg sign with by chef angelo sosa written bold i dont know the reason whi he would have his name in that scale and not be there at the veri least for the veri sensit open month that the restaur need his guidanc the most it quit perplex 

what we had 
1 pot sticker good textur but swim in sauc and bit sweet
2 burger under season burnt bun and the fri were so salty
3 kim chi fri rice i get it that it nice to have some char but man dri and seem undercook rice was not the crunch it suppos to have
4 chicken wing my kid had this and it waswowth bread was wownot in a good way huge
5 tomato soup it was goodthank goodness
6 salad sorri cant rememb which onebut if you can believ thisit was so salti salad salti im so confus 
7 dessert chip and ice cream was decent and strawberri shortcak was ok these were comp items
8 tap water i swear im not be a jerk by includ thisther is someth not right with the watergo ahead tri it it serious has a bad tast 

i digress chef sosa i know your read this you need to fli back like right now your name is on the signthis is a tough one to write  as a heterosexu male man crush are hard to come by for me   as an avid viewer of top chef and all top chef inspir show yes even just dessert and even life after top chef so help me god no contest ever hit that special combin of oh he seem like a cool guy and i mean yeah if i was gay or a woman id total the way angelo did   needless to say the possibl of run into this rare man crush speci altogeth combin with some of the outstand review this place has receiv from yelper i trust wholeheart and i was excit    then i ate there

i met a friend at the bar and she had alreadi start with an appet of meatbal which conveni were alreadi devour and all evid remov   she did tell me they were delici which rais my anticip even further   ever sinc tri comm cas excel happi hour and their specialti drink menu my fear of specialti cocktail has subsid a bit and i figur who els to trust with my specialti cocktail need than angelo  start with the sake sangria   it was good  realli good   though i must say the best sake sangria ive had yet is still bachi burger so in that sens it was a slight disappoint but still worth order   while wait for some food i also end up tri the raven and the poppi sling  i found them okay but they didnt realli hit the mark for me complet on either tast nor strength of alcohol  sort of regret not just stick with a whiskey and coke to be honest   back to squar one on the specialti drink thing i guess

stil have high hope for the food we receiv the follow  crispi pork dumpl chicken wing quinoa fri rice with pineappl a side of fri and a side of shishito pepper   sad noth realli excit me  the pork dumpl were fine but didnt realli stand out to me ani more than one i could get at tgi friday  the wing were similar for me in that they tast okay but they serious just tast like the pizza hutwingstreet asian bbq wing   im go to go out on a limb and say that was not the desir result  the quinoa fri rice is rave about on here and was probabl the item i was most look forward to and yet i found it over sweet and bare finish half of the plate  all i can rememb of the flavor was that yup i tast pineappl all right  shishito pepper offer noth new and the fri were par for the cours as well   i will say i did enjoy the kim chee dip sauc quit a bit especi the more i had of it

on the plus side the servic for the most part was except  the two bartend work their ass off make sure all the ladi were get their free glass of champagn dure happi hour and angelo himself stop by to ask how everyth was and true to charact i lie and said everyth was great   it was alreadi over by that point  now my man crush heart has onli room for gosl i know the gosl thing is tire but i just cant shake this feela cowork of mine sent me a link to this restaur websit and sinc she know that i am tri to eat more healthi recommend this place as a healthi altern for lunch  so after about a week and half of hem and haw i final decid to give the place a try

i order a regular raspberri pecan bowl with pea protein whey protein and extra granola    wont lie    thought it was kinda pricey for what i order    over 1000
sinc the place is extrem small    three tabl and a two seat bar counter insid and two tabl outsid    and with no place to sit i got my order to go

30 minut later    my order final was readi    definit need more than two peopl work and more seat if this place is go to be success    even the up man who was deliv a packag left after 10 minut of not even be acknowledged

oh well    after a short trip back to the offic i sat down to enjoy my acia bowl    and i was pleasant supris    i was realli realli good  veri tasti just the right balanc of smooth crunchi and sweetness

wil i be back    probabl    but if all of the seat is taken and  or there are peopl wait in line to order    i will probabl go somewher elsthere seem to be a trend in vega where a slight uniqu restaur open in town and everyon goe nut over it for month on end case in point honey salt eat poppi den ani gordon ramsay restaur and pretti much half the place on the strip and from my experi so far at some of these place theyr all overr and honest noth out of this world if you were worri that there werent ani new one along come fat choy to kill your worri on top of their famous bao bun theyr now offer a trendi burger to pleas the mass so i head over to see what all the hype was about

fat choy is locat insid the eureka casino an over smoki tini aw casino in an older part of town and when i say smoki let be clear it complet aw upon walk through the door you get smack with a wall of cigarett smoke the like of which i havent experienc sinc the last time i went to the doubl down the build is tini the formula of a small space and a group of depress look old peopl smoke endless at slot machin make this for the perfect whirlwind of aw this smoke doesnt end in the casino for when you walk into the fat choy restaur space this smell doesnt dissip in fact at one point while i was wait for my food i marvel at the fact that i couldnt smell ani food cook just more cigarett i didnt spend ani more time in the casino itself other than walk through it to get in and out of the restaur yet my throat was notic sore by the end of my visit

th restaur itself has 5 bar seat 5 booth and a hand of tabl in a genericallydecor typic casino café style there were 3 or 4 tvs in the space each with a differ show on and unfortun the audio that was chosen for us to listen to was an episod of the kardashian major point taken off for that the menu is extrem simpl almost all asianthem item from potstick bao rice  noodl and even the burger there also a breakfast menu with about six item on it that are as basic as you can get we love a great pork belli bao sandwich so we had to order them befor our burger it was realli good the pork was extra crispi which i love and the peanut were spars but ad a nice extra crispi to them still as good as they were i cant say they were worth go out of your way to tri with sever other bao option in town

a for the fat choy burger it come with 12lb of angus beef short rib bacon fri egg cheddar and roast tomato upon first bite you immedi notic how incred messi it is mayb becaus of the short rib greas the rib had realli great flavor though as did the super crispi bacon the patti had good flavor but seem to be a bit of the generic premad varieti still it was cook veri close to the medium rare i order the egg was veri larg and had good flavor with a bit too much lettuc as usual i didnt notic anyth special about the roast tomato in the burger unfortun the bun was a bit thin for all this stuff but fresh and fit well with everyth els overal there were realli good flavor that differ from bite to bite but someth about it felt like i was in a dive café in a dive casino tri to outdo itself and make a tasti cult burger i was and for all their notic effort i dont think they quit got there

th fri were incred undercook to the point that most were ined they were of the frozen generic skinni fri varieti but i tend to like those if theyr overcook just right and not complet raw like these were in all i dont know if i get all the hype around this place the bao was good im no pro by ani mean but ive had better the burger was certain good but noth that stand out as be worthi to go into this aw smelli build ever again my meal could have been made better if the fri were decent but not enough to chang my mind too much so onc again ive been abl to experi a restaur that everyon rave about yet ive walk away complet unimpress and not will to revisit mayb i miss someth as everyon seem to think i did with poppi den burgr honey salt and probabl a few other so ventur here at your own riskmy momma alway said life was like a box of chocol you never know what your gonna get

wel no actual forrest gump said that my momma alway said for god sake ryan whi cant you put down that nintendo control and play outsid with the rest of the normal kid and what the hell are you wear all that tinfoil on your head for

no forrest gump was the one who talk about chocol and bubba alway talk about shrimp henc we now have the chain of the bubba gump shrimp co restaur theyr all over in touristi spot and the seestur rave about the one in anaheim in gardenwalk she even sport the sweatshirt proud this from a girl who would practic retch if she even got near seafood

so boy howdi was i excit to see that there was go to be a bubba gump shrimp co on the las vega strip so excit that i didnt even care it was locat mere step from the horrifi to me goretorium i was go to brave the danger and go to bubba gump and if one of the evil scari monster from goretorium andor one of the sleazi pornocard giverout on the corner of harmon and the strip came after me well by god i would buy fresh boxer from the bubba gump store

if life is like a box of chocol i should have tri poke the bottom of the candi befor come here i got stuck with that one everyon els dodg you know the one with the pink creamish center that suppos cherri or raspberri but tast more like pepto bismol

la vegan hard need a reason to celebr but we find them anyway and as i had just been unceremoni and hurri boot out the door by my former employ iron who stood across the street from harmon corner and rhyme with bosmopolitan i decid to have a littl new beginningsi got fire dinner at bubba gumps

figur i was the last one there as i usual am and not want a demon to jump out of the goretorium and eat my soul i ask one of the store clerk so im in the store but where the restaur she smile and direct me up the stair toward the back of the store a sign or someth would have been nice

i head up the stair where i was actual first gather the parti and we were seat they explain the licens plate on the tabl that say run forrest run and stop forrest stop which i thought was a cute touch

th crew was stellar our main waitress was super bubbl and thrill when she heard we were all local like appar they had not been frequent the place what a shock no local on the strip she was veri attent to our need to the point where we never realli need our runstop plate on our tabl she even regal us with ghost stori in nearbi mine town so despit whatev els i say in this review the staff was great and should be commended

and with that be said well 

we start with a round of drink sinc it was my fire parti i was readi for someth nice and strong so i went with bubba blue hawaiian vodka rum gin blue curacao pineappl juic and sierra mist yes pleas come to daddi the menu say 899 but dont be fool that doesnt includ your collect bubba gump glass so your more look at 13 you have to specif ask to not get the collect glass wherea i think it should be the other way around but the drink was pretti good not quit an amf so it wont belt you on your ass but not a total tame drink either

dinn came around and i have to say i was grave disappoint with my dinner  i got the shrimper heaven which along with french fri came with fri shrimp chilli shrimp coconut shrimp and shrimp tempura along with three sauc asian cocktail and a cajun sauc that remind me more of orang marmalade

i start with the chilli shrimp which i thought was just go to be cold shrimp like you might find in a shrimp cocktail no in fact that is wrong chilli shrimp is bubba gump version of peelneat shrimp which mean the shrimp is cook insid it shell yes shrimp have shell and shrimp have leg which took that portion of the dinner from tasti seafood morsel to creatur that use to be aliv probabl leav behind a famili he support and a shrimp compani job that will have to do some pr work to explain his disappear and he was probabl name charl i cant eat thing that could probabl be name charl so there a quarter of the dinner shot down

th rest was toler the coconut shrimp and fri shrimp were kind of dri but the shrimp tempura was fine

what wasnt fine was the bill for just that and the drink after gratuiti i was pay 55 by myself peopl i just got fire just becaus i was paid out my vacat pay doesnt mean i need to be spend it all on dinner ill stick with lazi joe for some good afford shrimp from now on

i guess stupid realli is as stupid doesummari everi time we visit vega we alway walk by bubba gump but never stop in so for this trip my so decid to drag me in i like the set kind of remind me of boil crab httpwwwyelpcombiztheboilingcrabgardengrove2osqboilingcrabrestaur minus the sharpi on the wall

food base on yelp review we decid to tri their hush puppi first to see how it is befor head in to the main cours luckili that is all we tri the hush puppi was bland and veri oili 

servic 5 star for the staff member from entranc to exit the whole staff was cheer and friendly

overal we should have kept walk we should have stick to hmm mayb one day we should tri this place and just never tri it so it could stay mysteri but we tri it we didnt like it end of storifinal had a chanc to hit tt last week sinc i was in the area around lunch time  geez not sure whi this place is get so much love  i gotta admit i was in a bad mood after park then walk by geri and  it appear the place has perman close  downer

so i walk in tt and confus by the lay out  a bottl neck at the regist made it difficult to get to the appar front of the store  after almost caus a scene when my big butt bump into anoth tray as they were head to the dine area i final make it to the order area  i went with an al pastor and an asada taco along with a mexican corn  

as i sat in my car look at the food i frequent compar what i saw with what i get at el gordo  i feel the taco are slight larger at eg  also believ the pastor at eg is more flavor  frank i found the tt food had littl flavor   the  corn  basic uncook and not much in the way of chees i did like the sauc select and the servic was friend  i feel i need to give the place a 2nd chanc and i will  somedayso there was this pizza joint in tivoli villag onc upon a timethey didnt put out a qualiti product in a locat where that matteredoh guess what theyr back with that same level of qualityon this time they just might surviv off the tourist and bar hoppers

i was in the neighborhood and need some food  my friend and i saw that someth new was open next to insert coin  we thought wed check it out  i wish we hadnt  the pizza is just okay and the servic had mani issuesleft hand never seem to figur out what the right hand was do the whole time we were there  if the the end product was great id give them anoth shot to improv the servic after all they havent been open all that long  as it is i have no reason to stop back in here  id rather drive a few min or walk a littl farther for someth i want

if you find yourself here howev and you are set on stay it seem like bbq pizza or parm fri might be the way yo gothis place had so much potenti they are set up right next to the new park on fremont they have small outsid patio for those who love to eat outsid like i do but that about all they have go for them im still not a downtown lover even with all the new renov theyv had over the year i keep give it more tri yet i am still not fall in love like everyon els we were go to a 51s game and my compani happen to be a coupl with a 3 yo so we need someth kid friend decid pizza would be best seem like we had the opposit of everyon els experi good servic but terribl pizza 

we start out with 

medium wing great flavor but both the ranch and blue chees were so water down it was imposs to keep it on the wing we even tri pour it over the wing and it would just run off 

hawaiian pizza again it had potenti huge piec of jalapeño red onion pineappl cilantro and ham the pizza was so disappoint it was soggi you couldnt pick it up to eat becaus the top slid off the crust was like mush i end up eat it with a fork and knife oh and they serv pepsi product anoth let down bad ranch soggi pizza and pepsi make for a realli bad pizza experifor the love of pizza that my cowork  i share we decid to tri this place  we havent been to near our offic a nice market ladi came by and drop off a few flyer of their menu on the menu it state if you dine in youll get complimentari cheesi bread with your meal when we got there and mention it the waiter told us that his boss wasnt in so he cant honor that that confus than i ask him what your soup of the day was and he unconfid state there isnt a soup of the day mm no bread  no soup of the day ¯ツ¯ 

the caesar salad my cowork order was just lettuc  one wedg tomato there was no crouton onion or ani type of chees which usual come with a caesar salad 

mi italian wed soup came out warm if i dont have to blow on the spoon befor i put it in my mouth than it not hot enough the pizza was pretti ok noth that realli made it special id rather go a park lot over to east west pizza for lunch and get 2 slice of pizza that come with a drink for 5i hate have to leav this review becaus the portillo in scottsdal blew me away when i first heard of this chain my 1st visit to this portillo in temp was this past weekend i was super excit for i was travel from qc to scottsdal and new this locat had just open and i had to pass it to get to my friend hous whi not tri it out sinc the other locat is out of the way and far from me i was soooo super excit i think i may have exceed the speed limit to get there lol the drive through was pretti thorough and awesom when i arriv you had veri nice but crazi peopl becaus they are stand outsid all day in this heat take your order i order my norm chili chees hot dog and chili chess fri my order was confirm by at least 3 differ peopl walk down the drive through take order and by the person who collect payment they were all veri nice and quick i pull up to the last person who brought me my order even repeat my exact order back to me super happi my order came out befor the 2 car ahead of me how nice and fast left the drive through and rush to my friend to devour my delici food when i got home and open up my bad of delici i was complet disappoint immedi sad face i receiv the wrong order you know the feel you get when your parent tell you your go to disneyland and they end up take you to the doctor instead it felt like that the build up of awesom then the tremend sad in the end i was so sad and frustrat for you are look forward in enjoy a delici meal and you receiv an order you dont even want i receiv a regular hot dog with mustard it would have been fine and i wouldnt be upset if i like mustard if i like mustard a tini bit but i complet cant stand the tast of mustard i hate it i tri scrape the mustard off the hot dog and throw the bun away but it still had it mustard tast so i toss it my chili chees fri end up be normal fri so i ate those and pout i know thing happen in the drive through ever now and then it was just frustrat for my order was repeat to me so mani time there was no way i felt i even need to check it befor i left the drive through then get all the way home to eat it and it not be the right order is just frustrat it a wast of money and then a wast of gas to drive back to get my correct order i will tri to give temp anoth chanc if i am in the area and check my order everi time will be a must now you wont find me drive out of my way to tri it again though hmmm this review is probabl one of the most difficult to write 

i live within 3 mile of this restaur i have driven past mani time and alway wonder what it was about  when i saw the review on yelp i thought it was worth a try

howev i realli dont understand whi peopl would give this four star it a cheap and not veri good burger joint with some hot dog and want to be sausages

i order it thai and meet and sausag sandwich and it was just a big soggi nasti mess not veri appet and not veri good at all

th french fri are like you buy from the store frozen oreda theyr not well cook or well season or uniqu at all  

the salad bar is a joke it look like a mess and not veri good option or tasti offerings

th hamburg are plain and disgust not much thought no uniqu it not even as good as cook at home

th chocol cake was disgusting

 peopl will review say it cheap and good but it not even cheap you and up pay near 5 buck for a hamburg and fri smash burger is far better for the same money

i realli have a hard time understand what peopl see in this placei bought a groupon for johnni rocket and it about to expir so we stop here on the way home from a show to use it  my wife order the bbq chicken bacon melt and i got the philli chees steak with pepper and mushroom  both came with unlimit french fri  we also got two larg fries

th sandwich were ok  noth except nor were they less than anywher els  the fri were not salt after fri and they were dri and didnt hold salt onc we got them  asid from that it is a fast food court with a pizza shop and the staff went between the two as need  you place your order are given a buzzer and you get your tray when the buzzer goe off

th sandwich are overpr  perhap theyr cover themselv from peopl who take advantag of the unlimit fri  the servic was slow  there was one person ahead of us and we wait about 5 minut for fast food  not good  in addit there are no plastic fork or knive avail without ask  i had to ask for artifici sweeten for the ice tea  i could pay the same amount i paid tonight at mani other sit down restaur where i have server bring my food in a much more appeal atmosphere

if your a fan of johnni rocket and buy a groupon it best for a person go alon  use the groupon to almost pay your entir tab at about 12 price  that would be about what it worth  johnni i met you onc  i wont be backwhen scoop the real name of this place pop up in my neck of the wood i notic it for a coupl reason 1 becaus i rememb peopl on yelp reminisc about thrifti and 2 i live in the restaurantbarren wasteland of north las vega  ani new busi here should be celebr with a 3hour long parade

anyway ive given this place more than enough chanc to wow me and i just realli dont get the hype  sorry

th ice cream tast like it was made with realli cheap ingredi  it almost has a chalki tast and seem to me like it been sit in storag at a warehous for a few month befor be ship here  

ye there are a lot of flavor  yes they are more afford compar to other ice cream place  yes it come serv in an interest scoopshap  but it also doesnt tast good

id rather save my money for the next time im near luvit frozen custard  in the meantim ill pick up some ben and jerri at smith next doornot terribl but veri expens and a bit of an odd presentation

i stop in for lunch the other day and sat at the bar  i found the menu a bit confus but final settl on the porkbelli with collard green  

it arriv quick  the plate was a 5 inch squar plate with what was perhap a 3 oz piec of porkbelli sit on top of about a cup of collard green  for 1200  what was odd was the porkbelli was sit in a good half inch of the liquid from the green but all i was given was a fork to eat it with and there was also no bread  did i mention it was 1200  at lunch i ask for some bread and they brought it out quickly

th pork belli was pretti good although a bit on the dri side  the collard were just fine but it hard to mess up collard green isnt it

i ask for the menu again and now i notic that everyth is a la cart even on the lunch menu  so i guess i was suppos to order a side of potato for an addit six buck  

as anoth yelper has point out this is after all a restaur sit in front of the walmart so this all seem a bit pretenti  look i dont mind pay for good food in the least but i do object to be present with a tapa size portion when i order an entre particular when it is involv such low food cost item as pork belli and collard green  serious come on guy what is your food cost on this dish  ill guarante you it under two buck  in my book that a ripoff  

anyway im not realli sure paradis valley need such a precious restaur but i guess time will tell   i left hungri and 1600 poorer

fin i dont get this recent bizarr and unwelcom trend ive observ recent of nice and expens restaur not serv bread   what up with that  if your go to serv tradit europeanamerican food and charg a lot of money bring some nice artisan bread to the tabli went on a saturday afternoon i usual get food for my cowork and weve been curious to tri this place out becaus it was a diamond in the otherwis rough indian school rd area i got to the drivethru at 230 think that it would be quicker than go in  i had to be at work at 3 so no problem boy was i so wrong

a i arriv at the speakerbox the employe immedi told me to hang on a moment as he was busi with the current custom at the window no problem new store new employe new thing to learn i understand 

then  silenc 5 minut later still no respons car were start to pile up behind me so i final ask if i could order and this is the repli oh  yeah i forgot you were there  cool brah my selfesteem thank you 

i order a dulch de lech shake the short rib and chicken taco and the burger with fri when i roll up to the window the younger man work the regist tell me to wait again as the card machin wasnt work and my food would take a littl bit understat of the year

it 255 now and im wonder if theyr pluck the chicken feather and scrape the meat off of bone back there becaus that the onli excus for have to wait so long when they final work thing out and hand me my food  i end up late to work hastili give out the food to my cowork and sneakili eat my own burger behind the counter 

basic i dont see the differ in buy a burger from here or 5 guy even though they say it made with differ ingredi both are the same high price when you take top into account same patti size dont come with fri and they both have excess juiceoil drip down my hand fri tast exact like the salt and pepper boulder canyon chip except they went a littl heavi with the black pepper and when i ask my cowork if they enjoy the taco they told me next time to save my money and go to taco sahuayo nearbi for someth tastier and cheaper 

the onli thing i can compliment them on is the dulch de lech shake but anyth els is just alright noth special i hate it when everyon els has a good experi and im the odd one out yes i did it again  i had to it onli fair  besid this was a differ five guy  some pervers logic convinc me it must be better than befor  sad it was not

i was hit up amabassador cigar to fulfil my stogi need when across the crowd park lot i spot this five guy  it new i thought it lunchtim and im hungri  just as befor i was left disappointed

oh yeah i total dig the order system keep it simpl burger dog and fri  all the condiment you can cram between those bun  free  too bad they overcook the burger  yeah i know they advertis juici welldon becaus that what we believ our burger are best at  hello  that translat to overcook dri chewi beef  the good news is that they dont use pink slime boy am i reliev after read that on their menu  it also not organ freerang and humanelytr beef  but five guy want you to know they think that ok

alright so off the soapbox  i got the baconcheeseburg with mayo mustard pickl lettuc tomato and jalepeno  when i got back to the offic close the door and unveil this burger delight it just sat there  i gentl wrap it up in the foil wrapper leav a fresh edg love rais it to my lip and took a huge bite  damn  stale bread dri tough burger i think there bacon in there somewher and crunchi veggi  i knew there were crunchi veggi and bacon too caus i could see these item peek out after the stale spongebread bun crumbl away  tast them you ask  not so i say  this was a caricatur of a real burger all color and prettylook but lack in the most import compon  flavor  note i did not order fri  becaus ive had them befor  limp oversalt and frank offens to fri everywher   but as the poster befor me say that how they do things

i dont get the hype  here is what i do get though  for a mere 250 more than i paid for this mess i can get organ freerang neiman ranch beef cook a perfect medium rare did somebodi say juici on a fresh brioch bun um yep right down the street at a delux burger shop  go figur their fri are crispi too

fiv guy  i usual give it three strike but i gotta say the odd are against you im not sure i can do that againwoooooooowwwwww 

i feel like im take crazi pill 

what are all of these peopl do give such high review 

onc a month i meet up with my ladi but after one of our foursom flake it was me and anoth femm with our name on the list for 3  we were wait for drunki who probabl slept in  we went to the brandspankin new locat which is appar huge with a whop 9 whole tabl it could be more but i am not exagger i can onli rememb 9 we wait for 20 minut in the wait area and our friend was still not there suspect hangov but they call our name and we were seat  our love young male waiter came along and we order drink and told him our friend would be along at ani minut  he said no worri and would be back with our beverag  

let me start off by say i never go to breakfast joint becaus i do not eat egg  no im not a vegetarian or vegan i just hate the idea of eat a fetus  that all  unfortun that left me with one or two option with the veri egg heavi menu a waffl meal a side order of sausag or juic  bring on the waffl we wait and wait and wait for our slacker friend for ten minut dure the ten minut wait for our friend it began to get pack at the front door with foodi glare at our horribl twosom for take a fourtop how dare we dont blame us for where the hostess seat us  after 10 minut the hostess walk over and ask us what the hold up is 

 

im sorri are we not shovel down your big breakfast fast enough for you  we polit state that our friend was go to be there ani minut she was she was text us that she was down the street 

then the hostess say verbatim im sorri were not suppos to seat parti until everyon is here your go to have to order right now



appal and not will to fight i say okay well i guess we were both get the waffl and britney will order when she get here 

the host repli unfortun im go to have to ask you to order for her or we wont be abl to accommod an order for your friend

i giggl think she was joke  she stare blank at me

what

so your tell me that we gave you our name and our parti number 3  you saw two of us even though your littl notebook clear said 3  you sat us at a larg tabl leav the mastic buzzard hoard to wish us dead weve been here for ten minut when most brunch place expect you to wait at least 10 minut befor order  we cannot enjoy our drink or read the menu without feel harass we have to order befor our friend or els then you tell me that you will not serv a pay custom becaus she will order 5 minut after us that a joke right 

no joke  

i smile while all of this was be scream at the hostess from my angri brain

i tri to text brit but as she was park she didnt get back to me quick enough so we decid to order 3 waffl breakfast and hope brit wasnt allerg to anyth in the meal

luckili the second the food came out she was there and she enjoy her waffl  i with a bad tast in my mouth from that did not enjoy anyth after that experi  separ and apart from the hostess be a b the waffl were decent but not 45 star decent i would give a solid 3 for those

our waiter was clear embarrass that we were be blame for the hostesss mistak and told us that we should take our time and enjoy our breakfast i wish i had gotten his name becaus he was the onli redeem factor for this place and whi it is get 2 star instead of one  he is white skinni 20someth and realli chill and relax nice guy  

i will not be return and will find anoth breakfast place just as good in phoenix like i have all over the valley  plus with more eggless option as well  this place has pizzeria bianco syndrom where they think their food is heaven sent and give you garbag servic becaus you should be thank they even gave you the right to eat there  no thank you  the bill was appropri not exorbit  but if i want to be harass while i eat my breakfast ill eat with my parent 

thank but no thank matt i wish ye well but perhap with a better hostessthis is just your averag boba hous  the worker didnt seem to know what boba realli was either  she offer for us to tri the new strawberri dragon fruit but we had to buy it instead of sampl it  the worker also told us that it was realli good so we bought a small and it was horribl no real flavor except for the piec of strawberri and kiwi place on top 

mi husband order taro milk tea and i order thai milk tea  noth special have definat had better and was expect better  what i did like is that the boba has a plastic cover so that you cannot spill it  i would rather spend my money at lee lee right next doorthe girl repeat my order liter 8 time and still got it wrong wth smh then one of the co worker came up to her and start talk about her bf while take my order it was so rude they do not have good custom servic 

overal this place is chill the manag is super sweetkpop kpop kpop

almost fell on the way in entranc curv down so watch your step

real dark loud music cool vibe

friend and i sat at the light tabl instead of the bar becaus it was imposs to read the menu at the bar

w start off with strawberri  yogurt soju our fave and then order a mango one soon after serious like juic so good and not so sweet although i didnt feel as if it was as strong in alcohol as the other sojus ive had befor 

food wise  there was noth special noth that stood out from their menu
spici bland korean food ¯ツ¯

servic was like molass took forev for our waitress to come check on us and also took forev to get their attention
wond what it would be like if it was actual busy

could come back for the soju but in no rush of return i went to sleepi dog with a friend tonight for happi hour there are four phase to this review ill rank from good to bad

th beer  i love the select of their own brew as well as the other beer they had on tap i tri the sleepi dog tail chaser which was spectacular im a fan of hoppi ipa so this was right up my alley they also had 4 other hous brew on tap and then 6 non hous brew includ four peak sunbru

th vibe  what a weird setup i never went to the jazz bar it was befor but the light is veri bright includ the weird neon window frame the bar is far too small for a pubit can onli accomod about 1012 peopl insid and then there an outsid bar that open up to the insid a bigger bar would definit enhanc the pub feel for tabl seat there were far too few booth and just too much open space the stage is somewhat obtrus and make you feel like you are at the improv

th servic  this is where it was hit and miss our bartend was veri friend and gave us beer sampl and recommend a
food runner seem veri confus three time we had a food runner come up to the bar liter ask everi seat if the food she was carri was for them ive never experienc anyth like this mayb this is a function of be new but ive been to a lot of new place and never experienc this

th food  we onli had the hummus it was pretti good but the hummus to bread ratio was way out of balanc we end up have to eat half of the remain hummus with a fork not a huge issu but not the best way to enjoy hummus either

if i were just rate the bartend id say 4 star if i were just review the beer offer id say 4 star but the other issu kind of set this place back a bit i hope next time it is better becaus gilbert need these kind of local own pub and bar to keep peopl from go to chandler or temp and spend where they livei met a friend here for lunch she work across the street and inform me this was the 1st week this establish was open 

the interior is veri nice new sorta has that flagstaff feel to it we walk in dure noonish so it was busi i immedi notic that the staff are all women hot women unfortun they arent the brightest exampleth hostess check her seat chart and ask us if we would like a booth we both said yes and then anoth waitress arriv along side her and they both commenc to bicker about sit anoth parti at that booth 
we both let them continu for a few minut becaus it was amus see this then we final chime in and said the bar will be fine lol

w sat at the bar and i start to look around i notic and so did my femal friend there were hard ani women custom in this place hahah i count mayb 3 includ my friend 
okay so if you werent awar and i wasnt either the server all wear skimpi outfit veri similar to titl kilt 
this locat is locat in the heart of the corpor busi park area so liter 90 of the patron were middl age men in busi casual to corpor suit probabl 70 or more marri and come here to look at the women i alway wonder whi that doe it for most men i mean whi not just go to a strip club at least there i know and expect what kinda servic vibe im go to get plus the beer are cheaper and you get a better view if you know what i mean but i digress 

so hard ani women custom we both order a drink from the bartend she came back with my ipa beer overflow probabl the most horribl pour ever but i was tri to give her the benefit of the doubt oh she ask me if id like the girl size beer or the man size beer im not sure if that compani polici or she was tri to be cute i mean i wasnt offend but it felt like an awkward question to ask i went with the girl one i admit 

we both order food i had the ranch grill chicken sandwich with fri the bartend seem veri ditsi and clueless but she manag to get our order correct 

the sandwich was okay at first a littl bland but onc i got to the middl it was actual tasti 

we paid and left im not sure ill make an attempt to come back 

i have a feel after a few week month the hot waitress will probabl quit and they will have to hire better custom servic more compet women to fill those server spot i sorta got the feel that when hire they just put out add for hot girl in their earli 20s and if they were hot enough they were hire no matter of their skillsthat will onli last for so long it a restaur not a strip clubafter hawk the dos camino websit like a creep sinc the abrupt shutdown a while back i was to final enjoy the delici food i sin crave i was readi for a mission loos fit cloth  check somewhat starv famili check husband prepar for the financi damag check there was no way i could fail

forget this was a mission that had to be complet by two parti dos had to deliv or id be fight a war of devast and i deed that end up be the case 

we order guacamol chip and salsa the trio bocadito  may be the name of the app two kid slider meal 1 kid quesadilla smoke brisket enchilada and the short rib barbacoa 

the guacamol app was the initi warn enforc the storm call me 730 coocoo but they use to offer the guacamol trio not anymor  what ev so the guacamol was ok but i need more salt there was none cant you just not stand when a restaur fee the food s so on point that salt and pep are not need  well exsqueez me for have such a palat the salsa were ok my fave was the red one salt would have help also not sure what was up with the chip but they were chewi as the first review state on to the main dish to begin when do kid slider resembl three hamburg from mcdonald minus the fact that theyr serv medium what kid eat a medium burger 14 down the drain the chees quesadilla was ined smother in chees i couldnt let my son 10 month risk that cardiac attack so i sent it back the beef short rib ish was flavor but the meat wasnt as tender as it could have been it made it a bit rough to enjoy the smoke brisket was ok also just a king a bit in flavor 

i feel this day coulda just been a clusterfrack day for them be it was open day waaaay too mani peopl in your grill when your eat food just not up to par price for qualiti ratio out of wack i realli want to enjoy my meal but 100 tab left me feel sick and confus as to what happen mayb ill come back in about a year when the pace get a bit more establishi went on a saturday for lunch sever week after they open  the park lot was full which i took as a good sign but popular is not a sign of qualiti  when you arriv you dont actual get to see the buffet befor you order as it is around the corner  i thought that it would be like a better cici pizza but it wasnt even that good  they onli have 6 small pizza on the buffet for a dine room that seat hundr of peopl but they are actual do you a favor  the pizza itself is not veri good it tast like food servic pizza you might have gotten from a high school cafeteria  they add exot top to make it a littl more palat but the crust chees and sauc are so poor that it is a fail effort 

the other aspect of the salad bar dont fare much better  the pictur of the salad bar show a hearti look spring mix but the realiti was that the salad was shred iceburg like you might put on a taco   this is not an exagger that was the actual lettuc that was present  even though the name of the place is pizza ranch there were a lot more non pizza item present like fri chicken etc  this place must bank of one time visit becaus i cant see anyon go more than oncwhere do i start with poshburg  let just say that it been forev that ive written a review but the experi here tonight realli warrant one

th food and servic was excel 4 star  the concept and menu in our summerlin neighborhood realli need to be rework were unlik to return

w came with a parti of 7 4 adult  3 kid  the restaur was 12 full at 730pm on a wednesday night but we still had to wait 10 minut for our tableeven though we had reserv  not sure what the wait was for sinc all the tabl were alreadi set but they still made us wait even though they realli dont have wait area  we just stood by the front door while half the tabl were empti  the nice hostess seem as uncomfort as we were as she repeat apolog for not be abl to seat us  

onc we sat down we found the servic to be outstand but i person have a problem with casual restaur in our suburban neighborhood that dont offer a children menu  if we want fine dine without the kid we can drive 10 minut to the strip  most famili that i know eat out in our neighborhood with the famili  that what make restaur like honey salt so specialgreat food and great servic while maintain a familyfriend atmosphere

our group start with the a coupl order each of the buffalo wing calamari and caesar salad  all were excel  the wing were cut into drummett and were perfect season they were serv with a blue chees dip that was delici  the salt and pepper calamari was also veri tasti as was the salad  the caesar salad came with this great deep fri and bread egg that still had the runni yolk  wow

w had a groupon that came with wine and a coupl of the design burger  the wine was good and we end up buy a 2nd bottl  we order a few kobe burger which was realli tasti but for 29 the foie gras top was too thin  the side were realli good  skinni fri fat fri and onion ring  

i ask our server whether they offer a children menu  our server said no but he said that they offer all their burger in smaller slider version that came with a side  i didnt ask for a price on this smaller version but figur that a children version would be less than 10  the slider for my 4 yearold was 19  lol  to make matter wors they fail to bring his side of onion ring 

what realli irrit me is when a restaur add a gratuiti but the server conveni doesnt mention it when drop the check  ill typic tip between 2025 but in this case didnt tip abov the 18 that was alreadi includ becaus i alway feel cheat when the server doesnt mention the autograt  too bad in this case becaus the servic was realli good 

our meal tonight for 4 adult and 3 kid was 370  gourmet burger are dimeadozen in vega  bachi burger bar holstein shake and bun base on my experi here tonight i would choos inandout or five guy over poshburg  

too bad becaus i was realli hope that we would enjoy this neighborhood jointlike other here we were coerc in with the 99 groupon  we order the kobe and tuna burgers

th food was good  not great  just good

th cabernet wine was excellent

i order an applelim juic  like mani thing here it was pricey at 4 and the portion was on the smallish side but that didnt keep it from be spectacular  easili best thing of the night

but those arent my problem with poshburg  but these are

1 the groupon requir a reserv  when i made it i had to give my name four time  i spell it slowli and complet twice  i had the guy read it back to me  when we went it at 1800 they had no reserv on record

2 from the moment we sat down until we walk back out the door was two and a half hour  the compani was good so we just talk and talk and talk  but this doesnt even qualifi as slow  it glacial  be short two server is not my problem it the restaur problem  they need to solv it

3 we were there dure witch hour  dure the exact time of the year that we were there the sun goe direct into the restaur  there no shade or screen or overhang  the day we were there was perfect clear and the light was laser beam sear  everi custom in the restaur was wear sunglass  not have the sun screen is not my problem it the restaur problem  they need to solv it

4 18 gratuiti was automat ad to the bill post tax  ignor the fact that we essenti didnt have ani servic of qualiti this is complet and total incorrect  tip to insur prompt is calcul befor tax not after  you dont pay your server extra becaus ani given govern is take more out of your pocket  we did pay the 18 but made it a point to stop and tell the manag that our servic was abysm slow as we left  of cours we had to spend sever minut track someon down

5 they act a littl bit snooti here  certain without servic reason  so i add this sole as a kicker not that i actual think it mean anyth  when we sat at the tabl there were newunlit candl in front of us  the floor manag was be uppiti about the wine so i point out that unlit candl are actual an etiquett faux pas  they should have burn befor set on the tabl  who say that  ive never heard that  the same peopl who say it polit to say pleas and thank you  ive heard that it actual goe back to victorian time when some peopl had electr and other didnt  you burn wick so you werent put your electr usag in other peopl face

i wont be back  as i write this review i realiz im sorri that i didnt challeng the tackedon servic fee  my experi was probabl wors than the averag client but my advic is to be veri suspici of ani 5 review hereto all ramen enthusiast if your look for the real deal this place doesnt have it 

if you never had real ramen like the review below and are just compar to storebought cup noodl then yes of cours this is better it is also 20x the cost of your cup noodle

i order a bowl of miso ramen with roast pork and corn although ramen is usual salti this bowl was over salti and lack that rich usual found in the broth the roast pork was shred and serv icecold liter on top of the ramen which made the whole bowl lukewarm they had to warm up my friend charshu pork becaus it was also cold even though it was a hot day i would have prefer my ramen to be hot like it suppos to be the actual noodl were just mediocre

i see this as more of a fastfoodtyp place for the local colleg students

wil i be back like noti have been to this place twice tri the miso grill chicken and pork version of their ramen offering

tast it fine it ramen true carb so it fill and fine i person like the tast of miso and so i like their broth as well 

add on here is the rip off if you order the 8 bowl you would get some ramen spinach and kimchi you need to add on your protein and flavor for addit cost the more you pay more flavor you get

pric this is my main gripe ramen is the cheap grad student food cup o noodl like basic are veri pricey here and my 12 bowl of ramen is just not worth it

i eat a lot of asian food ramen pho etc and i would not recommend this place if you love your asian food as well 

they have a great market team though they are all over facebook kudo to thati never thought find a good hole in the wall place for mexican food in vega would be so hard i trust my yelp app and this is where we end up unfortun onli after drive by sever other yelp recommend place that quick were cross off the list for reason like no air condit and dirti places

overal this place end up be less an authent mexican restaur and more a bland whitewash mexican style eateri the food was tasteless and they didnt even offer a good hot sauc it was realli an unremark restaur easili forgett i cant say anyth tast realli good or realli bad it was all just blahim alwayssssss up for tri new sushi especi if it inexpens and revolv 

we had bought a groupon for this place and it actual right down the street from my hous so we want to tri it out i guess i kind of went in with high expect sinc my other favorit revolv sushi place is teharu and i absolut love them

i felt like the food portion were sooooo tini i felt like they did this on purpos so you keep get more and more sushi not onli that but the sushi just didnt tast fresh i think it was just straight bland there were a few roll that had such a strang combin for exampl there was a roll that had peanut with avocado no bueno then you had your tempura mix with banana lol i see that theyr tri to make their roll creativ but i cant see peanut rice and avocado be a good mix 

the onli good thing i would say is that the staff was extrem friend at the end though we didnt reach our limit on our groupon and it took them what felt like forev to figur it out i most like wont be come back here to get my sushi fix on so ive been mean to tri this place and when i stop by the first time they were still under construct so i wait for a coupl of week and they were final open i went here dure lunch to get someth quick and easi i went in not expect a whole lot from this place sinc i havent realli been too impress with a lot of the revolv sushi restaur here in az it was realli slow when i went dure lunch which i understand sinc sushi isnt realli an ideal place to eat or have for lunch anyways

th outsid and insid of this place is actual pretti big and they have 3 main tabl where the revolv sushi rotat around i sat down and just look at all their sushi roll that they had and i can immedi tell that they werent realli that fresh it look like theyv been sit out for awhil and the avocado on some of the roll were just look a littl too dark their las vega roll was super cold some of their roll were just kind of fall apart and didnt realli look like roll anymor i was not impress and i was not satisfi with my lunch that day either so after approxim 30 min of be there we just paid and left and i end up get chickfila nugget after 

servic was ok i cant realli complain about our waitress realli sinc we were the onli one in there but she was nice and she kept ask if we need anyth there were also 3 young sushi chef that were in the sushi bar area right across from us where we sat and when we walk in they just star and didnt even acknowledg us and said hi or anythwell holi shit  my first vega review  i have recent reloc to the citi of vega for work from the beauti derbi citi of louisvill ky and i am have a blast explor the citi and everyth it has to offer so let get down to it

to me the beauti of mexican food is that it is veri communal and downtoearth  it flavor are brought to life through the simpl prepar of simpl ingredi mix just right  it just good home food free of pretenti generous in quantiti and best enjoy in a laidback unassum environment

and that precis where la comida with it cool bohemian iron hip vibe collid with the heart and soul of tradit mexican food  it strip away the real idiosyncrasi of authent mexican dine in order to offer a distant mutat version of it conveni prepackag for the haughti trendseek crowd  let face it no mexican restaur tout ani kind of authent would charg so damn much for such modest portion nor would it pepper it ambianc with a faux latin cover of sweet dream by eurhythm and dubstep remix of ace of base which i caught play over the pa

to be fair the food was not bad  my pollo al horno was actual tasti though a bit on the dri side and the chip and salsa were also quit good and obvious homemad  the servic was also pretti good prompt and veri courteous so basic the root of my dissatisfact come down to price  look if your go to charg me 20 for a margarita i expect a commemor pair of booti short or a kitschi contain i get to take home or someth  there is also no way im shell out 5 for a can of pbr unless that can is a barrel and i also feel if im go to pay 16 for a chicken entre i should get my own rice and bean  have to share such a tini portion with my entir tabl didnt feel like a courtesi but more of a peeve

im not sure i want to back to la comida  i get the sens that theyr tri to elev and experi with mexican cuisin which is all fine and good but the food was just okay which consid the price and the ambianc to me it mean theyr way off the mark  a cool vibe will never replac a satisfactori dine experi so i echo the sentiment of those whove said they much rather eat a cheap seedi joint offer better food at reason prices

on that note whos got recommend for a good mexican place  sorri lv this is one area where i still remain far from impressfirst time here but i had to write something

o carnita a littl bland  on the dri side  good size for street taco but at 550 each they should be big  btw it is 2 to an order so 11 for an order  i did the math
o salsa a littl too old el paso heavi on the tomato light on the well everyth els 
o chip were decent but not sure if from a bag or fri in store  not veri salt which could be good if your blood pressur is high or bad if you like flavor
o shot a perfect don julio anejo but for 19 it had better be perfect

i like the cantina look of the place but not the mason glass or plastic chair  also no draft beer i did take a pictur of my food which had fair decent presentation

i typic am not harsh with my rate but 30 for 2 taco  a shot while sit in plastic patio chair doe not seem like smart restaur  i suppos the truth hurt it hurt my wallet for surela comida
food in spanish is comida yep they have food good thing they didnt name the place excelent comidathen you would have a case of fals advertis i realli love everyth about this place but the food the interior has an old world feel about it one of my partner in crime said  boy they sure spent a lot of money to make this place look old the feel of the room is well appoint with oldish mexican decor and art nice job on the leather cover plastic lawn furnitur i suppos the music mix cross music genr it hip without be trendi even mash some hispan influenc sound with more predomin english sound i see mix review with the servic we were veri well taken care of on that front server were excel chip were decent and plenti salsa while offer some complex sore lack heat i was there with 2 other friend got to sampl their dish as well as mine everyth and i mean everyth was just ok 8 buck for an ear of street corn kind of left me with the feel of be corn cob fuck in the culoand that was my favorit item of the day 5 dollar for a street tacoa bland one at that  realli one friend got some kind of 12 or 14 chicken dish that was niceand bland  listen i dont mind drop mas peso for a meal but if your not rockin my world then i wont be return to your  at this price point and onli 1 short mile away lie the delect mexican delight that is mundo a mile away in distanc but a world a part in flavor yes the name of this place is la comidaand yes they do have thatfood there are wayyyyy too mani realli good mexican mom and pop choic close by for me to wast my time here i suspect la comida will be a success plenti of folk are perfect happi with dumb down mexican fare in a well done atmospher with 20 margarita if just want food i would rather walk 7 minut to grab the excel 150 pork on a spit street taco from the littl stand at lvb and bonanza see ya la comidafirst impress of the place it look veri nice staff was friend although seem veri confus at times

first impress of food bread huge failur not homemad not warm not worth be serv in an italian restaur  someth you can buy at smith  mention to our server got a hmmm response

second point the server came and grab a glass of wine off the tabl she thought was empti it was not yet she still walk away veri fastrude

th staff stand in the dine room and talk to each other as if they are life long friend hang out rather then staff work in a restaur with customers

next she brought us the bill befor she ask if we want desert

th food was ok not the best italian food i have ever had but what can you expect from a menu that share itself with hamburg sandwich bbq beef french dip

th sauc they use for the pasta and lasagna was realli good sauc  they do have a menu of 10 items

so whi the two star well that would have to be the ok food and less then on servic  we ask the server if the salmon was wild or farm rais she did not know went to ask and came back say it was atlantic

w ask toward the end if the meal if the owner was there to which we were told the owner son was but instead we got a girl who said she was the manag  the issu with this place becom more and more obvious each step of the way

so let me say here the common ground between this locat and the one on durango especi in read other review is the servic and when you meet the manag you understand whypoor leadership result in poor servic  so let me continue

w first share with her about the bread and the answer we got was oh that is not our normal bread we normal have this realli good italian bread bake in our oven and serv at the tabl  we did not get our deliveri so we had to go out and buy bread  i said it was not warm and when we ask our server about it no answer was given  the manag said that was odd and that the server should have been abl to answer that question

 we then ask about the salmon and again the manag did not know the answer  so who is order the food  the server who i would not expect to know the answer unless ask often went in the back and they did not know the answer and now the manag of the place doe not know the answer  that say a lot about qualiti in itself  

then we told her about the wine glass incid mention abov and the manag respons she did that i am realli surpris becaus she has been with us for a long time and is one of our best server also she is sometim the bartend so she should have known better

i did not need ani other exampl as i have seen enough especi if i am be told my server is the best they have and there was no compass for the custom just constant justif on behalf of the server wow   noth more need to be said about this place other then they do have ok food and mani who dont care about qualiti will go here but if you want real ny style italian food there is a place in the same shop center and one a block east at the stop light on the right

last the tabl have a cloth tabl cloth with a sheet of paper on top  the tabl next to us had a huge stain on it which i have a pictur of and after the peopl got up and left all that was chang was the paper  the cloth with the larg stain stay on the tabl  if this end up be the onli place open i guess italian will not be on my menui use to come to chicken bonz when it was chicken bonz everi friday night and get take out 10 finger lemon pepper with their tasti dip sauc and ranch sinc it has chang to meat chix and weiner we have dine here 3 time the awesom girl at the counter who has alway help me said everyth will stay the same and the owner just didnt want to pay the franchis fee anymor that would be fals everyth has chang 

first off the price have increas the price for what use to be a 10 piec is now an 8 piec the qualiti of the chicken has also chang you know how when you buy frozen chicken tender at the groceri store theyr all ident in shape and size odd enough so are the finger serv at mcw they didnt use to be clone of one anoth so strike one

second the name is just disgust i had to tell my children that theyr not allow to say the name of this establish anymor  just call it chicken bonz it funni to the middl school crowd i suppos but not appropri for peopl with small children or those that respect themselv enough to not eat a place with such a dumb name

third they took away all the perk that made this place worth come to kid eat free with purchas  ayc wing everi day have now chang to kid dont eat free infact theyr watch famili guy which i wouldnt ever let my children even listen to in the store and there onli ayc wing for an extra dollar than befor on tuesday onli when i was there onc two guy walk out after read they dont have ayc anymor and that it would be too pricey

last the salad bar is disgust you can get ayc salad for a cheap price but it gross the lettuc is old and limp when i went at 2pm theyr too cheap to buy cherri tomato  instead just cut up a roma they have dri dri dri out babi carrot and can slice black oliv it is a weird canva to make a salad out of do not expect sweet tomato varieti here it not even close just imagin someon stroll through the can food aisl grab random crap and throw it right onto your plate

th owner was sick of pay the franchis fee but everi time i have gone back sinc theyv chang it has been complet dead so unfortun sinc he was too cheap to pay the franchis fee he now has no busi at all what wors he has turn what use to be a famili restaur my friend  i enjoy bring our children to dine at is now the complet opposit serv frozen chicken with limp salad i guess ill drive a littl bit further to raisin cane which i never use to eat at when chicken bonz was open i happili paid more for qualitibootlegg i want to love you i did and you made me sad face 

first the meat is amaz flavor and melt in your mouth amaz but you cannot get a 5 star review base on the virtu of your meat alon and your spotti servic and incomplet meal prove that you think otherwis 

the bartend did not know what kind of beer ipa specif that was even on tap dogfishhead ipagreat which one sir veri disappoint  the pblt which is describ as pork belli lettuc and tomato was absent the tomato i was go to mention this to the bartenderserv but he never reappear  our unclear dish sat on our tabl for 20 minut or more while the bartenderserv flirt with two chick sit at the bar  i had to get up and ask the hostess multipl hostess whi you onli need one bootlegg who were danc sing and fold napkin to get me a box for my remain food 

all around veri disappoint experi and although your meat is divin i will not be provid bootlegg ani further busi  onc you get your servic straighten out you could be a top notch restaurthe servic took longer than it should have for how busi they were
 we order one suprem croissant 2 taco with no lettuc 2 small oreo shakes
 we are the shake as we drive away 20 minut down the road we discov the sandwich has no chees and one if the taco was burnt beyond pretend it was edible
 im pissby now youv probabl all seen what this place look like either on the news yelp or instagram and it truli is beauti inside
i came with some famili member for happi hour
i was offer a drink but declin state i was go to wait a bit for the rest of my parti well the server took that to mean that i wasnt go to drink at all that night and routin ignor me when take everyon els drink order onc they arrived
th food was decent noth earthshatt invent or innov the blend margarita was good and the wine was tasti but as my uncl said just becaus the restaur look like a church doesnt mean they have to give us communion size portions
wil i come back yes sever friend want to tri it out are there better option yes im die to get back to gallo blanco better taco and less expensi was excit when taco guild open  so my husband and i decid to tri it out befor we went to the ballet in downtown on a sunday afternoon  first of all we wait ten minut befor a waiter came over to give us water and chip  then we wait five more minut befor we could order our food  last thing my husband order a burrito without rice on it and it came with rice on it    at least they were good about get him a new burrito pretti quick 

the atmospher was pretti cool and i like the look of the place but the servic was not all that great and the price are a littl high for a street tacoi want to like this place i realli did i was so excit to tri it outthey make meal like i do at home my mantra is grainproteinfatgreen it is what i do

so first we encount the bore girl at the cash regist who realli want to be anywher but there she sway when she wait her cat eyelin made her boredom look arrog  she couldnt wait to get our order taken so she could move on

th area is cramp it still summer so eat insid is appreci we had women sit at tabl wait for togo order  singl men take 4 top the rude in the patron was personifi doubli in the employees

i truli believ it must suck to work there  that whi it so hard for everyon to smile no one smile everyon look like they were be judg constant by the middleag blondeponytail woman behind the counter they look like they hate their job and frank it made it feel weird  i want to leav like i had been invit to a dinner parti where the host had just had a huge blowout fight befor i arriv awkward tension

so catey girl want my husband last initi becaus there were two john so he give her d when they final call our order they call john  two john stand up becaus the necessari d had been lost in communic 

the food is bland they offer some realli great sound sauc but as a greeneat myself i know a cup of spinach is dri to the mouth so mayb i wouldv done better to choos anoth green or mayb when they use spinach they should make some allow for the tast in their measurements
mi husband did like his howev he did not have spinach

it overpr i can make the same thing at home for 2 per famili member  i would feel more comfort pay 78 than 10 it feel like i have to be exploit becaus i like to eat organ no i dont

now is it an awesom idea yes do they offer a semiquick healthi lunch altern yes would i go back nowe made reserv here sinc we were see a concert at the mgm arena  i high recommend make reserv onlin befor come sinc there were mani peopl wait to get a tabl  

but that be said i wouldnt recommend the food  here it goe  we start off with the pretzel and chees appet  pretzel good but the chees was not  bummer  i had order the nacho off of the appet menu  honest i wish he would have told me how huge this was  i couldv been split easili between 4 peopl  this jicama relish on top was not veri good  spend this much on nacho i was hope was someth tastier  my husband order the champ burger  a 19 burger  was it worth it nope  i had a tast and was disappoint  

the servic on the other hand was impecc  there were constant peopl come over to refil our drink  our food was out quick and our waiter was veri friend and profession  70 later you would think it would have been a better meal  bumi was tempt to pass on write a review becaus this restaur is unlik to make it howev the truth must be told and it realli tick me off that we were fool onc again by review who are either shillsfriendsrel of the restaur owner or who have no idea what authent thai food should tast like or perhap both

first off the restaur name is iron to the max it couldnt be farther from the truth some exampl are in order have you ever heard of a thai mix green salad that is top with potato chip lay brand by the way huh i know heck for that matter i have never seen ani kind of salad that was dress with potato chip have you the potato chip werent mention in the salad descript either it consist of way too littl green and some not so fresh look slice of hard boil egg and small dri piec of fri tofu the best part of the salad was the peanutbas dress but it still left a lot to be desir and was certain not worth 8

next dish was the special tofu with ground pork the fri tofu was okay but what is with the over sweet cornstarch gravi and dice carrot and pea ive never seen such a preparationconcoct at ani other thai restaur anoth fail

third dish was the tofu padseeew relativelyspeak this was the best dish we order howev it was way too char and over caramel and the tofu was tough and dry

fin we got the spici catfish which consist of 5 smallish piec of seem beerbatt fish for 12 the rest of the dish consist of filler ie sprig of peppercorn and bamboo strip for the price the portion size was far too meager and it didnt redeem itself from a qualiti standpoint either the deepfri batter was soggi from sit in the spici sauc and the actual catfish was surpris bland

servic was okay although our dish were a bit slow to come out they were fair attent at refil our water glass ambienc is lowbudget and kind of sad it a veri wide open space with too few tableschair to fill it i did not see ani sort of water featur that was mention by anoth review not that i realli care about such thing anyway i just want the food to tast good and be a reason value

th singl mitig factor was their 25 off grand open promo run until 616 but frank it wasnt worth it even with the discount fool us onc shame on you guy real thai food what a joke you heard it here firstthis place is a glorifi fast food kind of place as i quot my sister hey this look just like a chipotl except for skinnyfat has much more comfort chair and the space is realli small dure the visit we order a few item including

th happi mess  it a bowl fill with truffl flavor fri thin strip of steak and top with tomato salsa and lot of blue chees the fri and steak themselv are realli good with the ketchup i dont think the chees and salsa go well with fri but that just me next time i think i will stick with the plain truffl fri instead

mor cow bowl  a rice bowl fill with teriyaki beef pineappl sauc and veget they use too much sauc which made the whole plate super sweet and heavi we hate this item

ahi taco  i didnt tri this item but my sister said it was okay not great not horrible

edamam with chili garlic glaze  the edamam was drench in a sweet glaze i think i prefer regular edamam with sea salt better

ov all  id come back here for fri but im not too crazi about the item we ordered

on a side note they have fresh squeez juic here and theyr 910 per drink that pretti priceyi total love the concept of this place and want to like it more but cant do it i feel like it a littl overr tbh ive been here twice and both time it alway super pack with no place to sit their set up is weird you cant tell who is in line to order stand around wait for a tabl or just look at the menu the entir area that wrap around their bar is also veri cramp not veri much space to move around 

after i place my order my friend and i had our eagl eye on search for an empti tabl we liter stood there and wait for someon to get up and immedi ran to claim the seat felt like vultur but everyon els was do the same thing i wonder if it a fire hazard have so mani peopl in there at onc anyway our tabl was still a mess the previous parti trash was pile up on the tabl but no one came around to clean it we didnt mind becaus we didnt wanna lose our tabl onc the food came out the server just pick up the old plate and replac it with our meal she didnt even wipe down the tabl there was sauc spill on part of the surfac eek 

asid from the annoy busi atmospher the food is not so bad they have a healthi and happi side to chose from i had the smoke bowl and thought it could have been a lot better the brown rice was dri and flavorless chicken had way too much sauc on it it was just a weird mix my friend had the chicken and waffl i had a coupl bite and thought it was amaz truffl fri were bomb too and the last time i came i had the portobello sandwich from what i rememb it was good but a bit too greasy

on a side note dont park near the back good luck tri to find a decent park spot near the entranc when it busi but trust me do not park further back becaus that where giant cargo truck unload their stuff i liter was stuck in my park stall for over 10 minut becaus i had no space to back out the damn truck was block me in im glad it wasnt hot outsid today becaus i would have been super irrit lolfood option at rio are veri limit and there is not much open dure the day this vietnames orderatthecount spot locat in rio food court is one of the few place open for lunch the food here look less greasi than the deli next door but the food was below averag the grill pork had an okay flavor and decent moistur but it tast like it was precook and then simpli heat up the egg roll had an unappet color no golden brown exterior a bland greasi and white deep fri shell

i imagin rio offer free self park like all the other major hotel and casino on the stripline to the order countersmal discount for total reward cardholdersfri egg roll pho bowl and bun bo hue orderedpay first and wait for number on receipt to be calledlengthi wait of over fifteen minutesselfserv sauc and pick up food back at the counterfind a tabl to eattold the bun bo hue was good by the worker but find quit bland and meat chewynoodl quit bloat and overcook softsam problem in pholack much flavor and slight bitter tastefind onli the fri egg roll be pretti goodso i show up at 10 pm the friday they just open anticip some good sweetness

right away i am disappoint for they are out of the mango and strawberri snow cream so me and the wifey decid to tri the number 3 shinobi nut

w decid to share a ninja size for 550 becaus the sumo size was pretti big for 7 buck again we were disappoint for the shinobi nut was way too sweet 

if you refer to my pic they onli have 5 differ snow cream flavor i guess i am spoil by yougurtland sinc they have all sort of differ flavor not to mention tart and sugar free option for those those that are use to froyo you serv yourself and are charg by weight these guy put it in one of two size you pick and then give it to you so they charg by size and not by weight 

so for now it is a solid 3 star i will come back again to tri the mango andor the strawberri snow cream im hope it not too sweet either dont get me wrong a littl bit of sweet goe a long way especi when you are alreadi ad more sugar to it a la gummi bear chocol etc

i will updat accord base on my next visit hope it a good onewant to tri the other guy and near went into a diabet koma at kuma this is not fluf ice as it should be the textur is more like frozen yogurt that is over sweet and gooey with a process tast they onli offer 2 size start at 500 which is high and the smallest size is still too much to finish such a heavi dessert the plus is that you get up to 3 top includ and a drizzl of your choice
park lot is small and a bit chaotic store is bright and clean with modern feel
i do prefer the lighter textur and flavor choic of the other place over kuma and am happi they are on our side of town but at least i tri iti went here tonight for their grand open and was shock by how not impress the food was i hate to give a negat review as a first review and also hate to give a negat review to a place that allow me to come to their grand open but it just wasnt veri good the food they were serv definit should have been good for exampl they had a kobe beef slidersound good right noit was not good it was ground kobe not sure whi you would grind such expens meat and it was cover in a weird sauc and then top with velveeta yesvelveeta it was such a wast of a good meat you couldnt tast the meat at allit could have been ground anyth for all you could tell addit the bf found a bone in hisnot so appet they also had mini burger bite that were decent but the way they were serv made it so you couldnt tast ani of the top becaus they all fell off befor it got to your mouth they were littl ball with bacon and whatnot on top skewer with a toothpick so the bacon and thing fell off when the burger was pick up the crab mac and chees was mediocr and i believ had velveeta in it as wellhow weird the pork sweet and spici wing were an odd textur and tast like frozen food not good the onli thing that was decent was the spici mango conea mango pud of sort with cayenn in it serv in an ice cream cone we end up leav after onli a short period of time becaus we didnt want to continu tastingwast their foodthat pretti bad when the food is free mayb this place just need to work out some kink but it was surpris that they hadnt done so befor this eventit was pack today spring break and i felt like they didnt know how to handl the crowd we wait in line forev to buy ticket then anoth line to get ticket scan and hand stamp and yet anoth line to get into the theater no direct they should have the line section off especi one to bypass the theater and enter the emerg galleri and conservatori faster i feel this process is realli ineffici and slow and definit could be fix so that was frustrating

th 3d movi was awesom my kid love it i love it actual 

the emerg area is small and we were pack like sardin in there but onc we got up to the glass it was cool to see the butterfli emerg from their cocoons

next was the conservatori this is beauti it just so magic have all these color butterfli fli all around it enchant note  it is realli humid in there and my 4 yr old freak out and i had to take him out for fresh air and water keep that in mind with your littl ones

th snack barcaf is realli expens i recommend bring your own snack and water

they have a small section with bug we saw honey bee a scorpion a tarantula and ant and some aquarium and a small sting ray tank in the middl i wasnt impress given the cost of admiss the sting ray are tini and you can bare pet them

overal the crowd made the experi pretti unpleas and bw hope will work on handl crowd better in the futur i know not to come dure high peak weekend that a given but also school breaks

i think the admiss price is too high as well not a lot of interact exhibit and onli one movi i dont think an annual membership is worth it for those reason and with 2 kid i typic spring for the membership  zoo scienc center children museum but i dont think we will be come back for awhili hate to give this place less than a 3 star review  i am give it this becaus the costtoexperi ratio is skew  this place in my opinion is not worth 19 adult and 9 for kid  you can also spend more and see a light show and some other things

mi opinion would be to visit the butterfli exhibit at the desert botan garden  you spend about 4 or 5 dollar more but you can have the same butterfli experi and tour the beauti garden  

i could not make the connect in this place between the amazon fish and the butterfli  i guess the fact that the conservatori is like a rain forest so the amazon is in a rain forest so includ fish in this exhibit  ok  i got it  not realli  i could understand the stretch to includ the bee but i could not understand whi they includ ant scorpion and spider  there may have been post sign to explain but i dont recal see whi these creatur were at butterfli wonderland  it seem to me as though at the last minut they decid to throw in some shark and fish and some bug to help extend the exhibit

furthermor their guidesemploye are not as help or inform as the dbg butterfli exhibit   i would have expect guid to be walk around and basic talk to peopl to share the inform like in other butterfli conservatori ive visit  

the 3 bright spot were the 3d film and the butterfli conservatori   becaus of the butterfli and the wonder climatecontrol humid of the rainforest like atmospher  oh how i love that humid  i didnt want to leav  dont be silli and wear jean or youll be veri hot  the 3rd bright spot was certain the butterfli emerg watch butterfli emerg from their chrysalis some of them look like piec of jewelri and spread their wing for the first time  amaz show right there

perhap this place is worth a onetim visit  for me i wish i had save my moneyok so my famili and i went here for lunch today saturday for the first time we got there just befor 130pm and we were seat right away even though 5 minut earlier when i call them on the phone to see if there was a wait the guy who answer told me there was a 20 to 25 minut wait what up with that 

so we had no less than 5 differ server they were all nice hipster type but the girl that took our drink order never came back so i had to flag down the next random person to place our order we got 4 differ taco the carn asada shrimp crunchi fish and grill fish to split between me and my son my husband got the tamal plate and we order the kid quesadilla for my 1 year old thank the quesadilla came out first becaus the babi was get antsi as for the rest of our food it took forev to come out in the meantim we were munch on the chip and salsa the salsa was good although the chip were not but we were starv so we had no other choice

when we final got our food it was good but honest the gourmet taco at rubio are way better and way more fill for less than the price they are here we would have order more food but it was so expens we felt it wasnt worth the money or ungod time it would take for anoth order to come out we did howev order the churro for dessert they came out fair quick and were good and came with melt chocol for dip 

so when we ask for the bill they brought it to us on a clothespin basic it was the receipt and a clothespin which my husband and i thought was pretti weird but funni howev the amount we had to pay for such littl food was not funni at all it was just over 60 yike so not worth it

so if your a trendi hipster live in the burb with cash to burn this place is definit for you my famili and i will stick to rubio definit wont be come back to this overr jointi was super excit to tri this place  my dear friend and his girlfriend love this place but my experi wasnt that great  first of all this place is in old town gilbert and the locat is poppin they dont take reserv and we had about 45 minut wait  the hostess was super friend and type my number and name into her ipad for a text messag remind of when my tabl was readi  after wait for onli about 20 minut we were seat  

we had had 2 bowl of chip for a tabl of six wait for us when we got to the tabl  our waiter came to the tabl and got our drink order howev forgot to write down one of the drink order and we had to remind him of that drink twice befor it came out  onc our waiter took our drink order it took him about 15 minut to get back to us with our drink  then anoth 15 minut went by befor he took our dinner order  our dinner order took awhil to get made and when the food came out our taco were cold  the taco are serv famili style which mean they are all on the same taco holder and if your allerg to fish or shrimp sorri your carn asada taco will be serv right next to the fish taco  

all of the meat taco lack flavor i would recommend tri the fish taco  it had the best flavor out of all the option we order  the waiter forgot to write down a few thing that we order and those thing never came out with our food  we decid not to remind him about those miss side as he would visit our tabl onc everi 15 minutes

i dont think i will be back here again  there are other taco restaur that i perfer over this placeid give a 1 star if the food wasnt so delici here that whi im give two 
the servic was horribl came here for a go away parti last week and we were sat in the middl of the room at a long tabl my boyfriend and i were a littl late so we ask the hostess if she sat ani big parti who ever she was text on her phone was obvious waaay more import then we were so we found our parti ourselv onc at the tabl it took us 15 minut to be abl to order drink i order my usual scotch and soda never be ask what scotch i want but i assum they would just give me their well scotch was i wrong about that but we will go over that onc i tell you about our bill

our drink final arriv about 10 minut later i order water as well so i remind the server when he drop off our drink our water never came even after remind him a 3rd time

th food was amaz as usual we had the heirloom salad padron pepper artichok toast cevich ahi poke and we split the spici shrimp i obvious took a break from vegan for a night the heirloom salad is freak amaz ive never had such a great salad 

onc get our bill we notic i was charg for macallan 12 for all my scotch drinker that are read this it is a crime to mix macallan 12 with soda if you cant just drink it straight just admit to yourself that you are by no mean a scotch enthusiast  and with a price of 14 i think a drink we werent too thrill on top of everyth the tip was alreadi includ and we werent told this so for horribl servic we end up tip doubl 

on our way out the same hostess was still on her phone text away if we didnt live in veer tower and were so close to this locat we would never return you would figur with all the bad press this restaur has endur they would step up their custom servicsummari wait for this restaur to go out of busi and tri whichev one move in next there is veri littl differ between this restaur and the burger joint from befor the menu is similar except they ad a steak and a fish item and the decor is almost ident 

i read a previous review that said veri nice thing about the salmon and steak but how could you expect me to pay 45 is steak when the waiter and waitress are dress like gas station attend and the place look like a dive bar 

the food was fine but realli noth special the server were tri veri hard which we appreci howev they lack the train of a proper servic 

food pork belli appet was good but too salti corn soup tast like a sauc and lack ani real depth mac n chees was pretti good crab cake slider were drown in tartar sauc even though we told our server to leav it off  i get that it ogden signatur sauc but ut not tgat interest especi if you dont like tartar sauc to begin with 

the food we ate wasnt worth the time and the thing we didnt eat that you think we should have tri werent worth the moneyi love bradley ogden at caesar and i want to love him for a long time at his new tivoli villag locat  a jame beardi in the hoodwoo hoo  yeah i admit i was palett pump but i still like to think i kept my expect in check and on low key for fear of disappoint 

i couldnt rememb if the decor had chang much sinc it bottl and burger beer and burger or whatev the heck that place was call befor which i had onli been to onc befor right befor it close  the surround and atmospher are banal and hohum dull but the tin ceil is nice and i could move on after all it a farm to tabl venu but as i sat there watch i had the feel that someth was missingand it was  

we did a lunchhappi hour hybrid

let break out the booze

noam punch  pusser rum amaretto st germain
fireston walker pivo pil 
great basin icki  ipa 
sierra nevada summerfest

becaus our first round languish at the bar the noam punch glass was drench in tear like the forgotten foster child that it was but tasti nonetheless  all the draft beer and wine are half price for hh so let keep dancing


prelunch pickie

gril chees bite with tomato herb sauce
mayb clown eleph and danc bear would have helped

im not readi for that final disappoint 

short rib patti melt  provolon  gruyer onion fanci sauc  
grill chicken breast sandwich  crispi bacon roast pepper bibb lettuc basil mayo

wel readi or not here it is  overwhelm drench in mediocr and tasteless calories

a lot of 70s elton john croon in the background but it didnt replac the peggi lee tune is that all there is that kept play over and over in my head and on my palett 

and that all there waswhen will peopl learn  we had dinner at caff daniel last night and while mani aspect of the meal were good we were overwhelm by the smoke of server chef and the owner  to watch the owner and employe stand outsid the front of the restaur and smoke is unconscion but sad throughout the even they  return to the restaur visit our tabl and serv food without wash their hand  the smell of smoke creat such a negat experi it will be hard to returnif one is lucki the trajectori of a new restaur goe from has promis but need to work on sever aspect to everyth is run smooth i enjoy come here after have return to pancak cafe i have to say that the restaur is go in revers on this occas i arriv with a companion on a saturday at about 1 pm after the earlier brunch rush there were mayb 15 custom insid and i saw our first bad omen a group of custom who dislik their food so much that a manag was attempt to calcul a refund for them

when we walk in we werent greet at all and there was no hostess present so we took a seat and wait after the manag put out a few metaphor fire in the place we were seat at a booth after pass anoth booth that had clear contain a famili with young children the floor of that booth was cover in partiallychew food and utensil not the most appet thing to see when your about to start eat our server brought out mug of coffe for us  i guess that pot of coffe the server gave me on my first visit wasnt standard protocol the half and half separ in the coffe with some unappet oili bead float on the surfac get our server to refil our mug requir herculean effort  we were complet unabl to get her attent and onli got them refil when she came with the check meanwhil we were watch more problem play out at the regist appar all of their comput and credit card reader had ceas work custom who didnt have cash were just be comp their meal wherea those of us who had brought cash were not im not say i just expect a free breakfast but it natur bothersom when someon who ate the same breakfast as you did get to skip out on the check due to have no cash so to speak ive seen this happen in other restaur and they alway have a backup plan there are even credit card reader program for cell phone and i was a bit surpris that they had no backup system they could have even written down card number to run for the bill amount later but this did not occur to them

just about the onli thing that wasnt a problem was the food i order the egg and spinach naan while it was in a menu categori state that it came with hash brown and a biscuit toast or pancak the server inform me after id order the side i prefer that it didnt come with toast or pancak becaus of the presenc of naan okay would have been nice to know befor i order serious a small note on the item descript would suffic but i shrug and went ahead with it anyway when the food came i learn that hash brown were appar not includ either  someth els that should be note on the menu this place isnt exact the best deal when not order off the earli bird special menu and i doubt id pay that much for this meal given the number of thing the menu promis that were not includ the naan wasnt realli naan at all true naan is an excel mix of crispi and chewi cook in a tandoori oven with littl air pocket throughout this was just flatbread and not so much chewi as tough it was quit difficult to cut the egg spinach and bacon were prepar correct and either the bread or the spinach had a delici garlic flavor that vast improv the entir dish my companion order the huevo ranchero and found them to be surpris tasti though he was unabl to tast ani refri bean on the plate though they were in the item descript it was a generous portion enough for him to take home for anoth full breakfast i realli hope that this locat get it act togeth it in such a conveni locat and it parent restaur is so goodi felt like i had just walk into the free weight area of gold gym or step onto the jersey shore lot of steroid and meathead 

kinda went here on a whim want someth healthi and want to tri somewher besid green  protein it was both my friend and my first time here the girl at the counter didnt seem interest in offer ani suggest or help us i decid to tri the greek signatur bowl turkey burger tomato black oliv feta cucumb and red onion and i chose quinoa for the carb this was realli lack in flavor and for 999 i was realli disappoint i also didnt like that they didnt have the nutrit valu available

they dont sell soda or have a soda machin yet they sell crystal lite and have 10 sugar free syrup behind the counter artifici sugar is just as bad as soda 

i dont see myself return if im go to spend the money id rather go to green  proteini went here a coupl of week ago for lunch with a cowork i had the berri lover salad which was decent howev the custom servic i receiv was not the best i am a larger personnot a bodi builder or slim by ani mean when someon is there spend their money on a servic you provid it might be best not to make a comment to a cowork to check out this chick and then have that cowork look at me and laugh keep in mind  custom are what keep you in busi and employ if you need to make a comment or laugh best not to do it when the custom can see and hear youwhile on a run up state st with my better half we pass the spot that was previous occupi by paul club and were surpris that a new restaur had open up  alway up to tri new thing us be absolut raven also didnt hurt we shower up and return that even to tri it out
th owner did a nice job with renov the space postpaul tree  the bar is on your right when you walk in and tabl line up against expos brick left wall  the menu is heavi on the sandwich option burger and panini with some appet salad and main entre sprinkl in
w start out with the sweet potato skin stuf with chees chorizo and green onion  while the spici of the chorizo play well with the sweet of the sweet potato the sour cream base dip was fair bland and did noth to complement the dish  for our main cours i went with the nacho burger while kati tri her luck with the grill chees  both sandwich come with your choic of side or soup  advertis with jalapeno a lime avocado sauc crispi strip of tortilla among other thing i was expect the burger to pack a punch of flavor  it was more like a limp hand slap when i bit into it  just noth excit about it  the same could be said about the green bean  saute in garlic butter the green bean were just ok  someth i could easili duplic at home
th grill chees serv on madison sourdough bread came with cheddar and gruyer but neither chees realli stood out  the cheddar was extrem mild and tast more like american chees than a true cheddar  again someth we could easili duplic and improv on it at home
i struggl with give negat review when a restaur first open but with the high densiti of restaur and the heavi competit that come with it i feel a restaur has onli onc chanc to impress a diner it critic they get it right this didnt happen with us and unless i read differ from other yelper dont think we will be stop back ini wont go so far as to my experi a total cluster fk but it pretti close  i arriv after my friend so they alreadi had a tabl and had been there a half hour and was still wait on their first drink order  onc we track down our waitress liter she took our order and disappear yet again  one of our order came out in about 30 minut but the rest had to reorder onc we track down our waitressagain  

it hard to imagin but at thursday night footbal i onli saw 4 waitress and to be honest none were move veri fast or seem interest in custom servic  i manag to get 1 beer in 3 hour with some of the smallest blandest wing ive had the displeasur of order   after all was said and done track down our waitress a third time to ask for our bill she had to take our order again as she couldnt rememb what we had  

the atmospher itself was decent but the food select qualiti and overal servic realli bring the star rate down we had a good time but that was due to good compani and noth to do with mcfadden  for onc i will go so far as to say i dont plan on return but if im misfortun enough to be back i hope i can rais my star level to at least a 3im between 2 and 3 star for this

ther is definit a reason to come here but it not what you think i want to come here as a sort of late night dinner from the pictur thing look good food was describ as good sure whi not

mayb it was my expect but i will say the food we had was disappoint long stori short this is bar food mayb next time were here well tri someth els but yeah we felt kind of rip off what did we have

 fri zucchini this was thorough overbatt and thus quit gross and kind of hard on the outside

 portobello fri if you want a good version of this go to echo and rig if you want an except hard exterior go to the sparklings

 tuna tartar absolut avoid this it a mix of tuna mango and avocado serv with three piec of toast the tuna was over firm and flavorless the mango and avocado underrip and hard as well noth particular bind it all togeth just some chunk in a cylind shape not worth it

 crispi gnocchi this was the onli item we would have order again an except flavor heavi cream and chees sauc cover a sort of crispi gnocchi sausag and nut it was nice but kind of small

yeah food is not their fort so what is now i dont know if this is becaus it was late but it was kind of shadi even be in there there was nobodi up front the whole place was empti just tabl and tabl in an otherwis abandon room you look to your right there a bar it a nice bar with nice bartend you will have a good beer and be abl to sit on the nice couch and chat nice but even then it not like it expansive

w be back for the bar but noth morefinal max restaur is here weve been wait for it for a while and now that theyr open we have to check it out

just so you know max is some kind of a fine dine restaur so expect to wait for a while or a coupl of minut for your order me and my husband order their famous 

whole chicken w coleslaw and fries
surpris good and tast like max in the philippin love the fri didnt even tri to tast the coleslaw not a singl bite of it coz it look so dri 

karekar tast like karekar but it lack of veget but the most disappoint part was it has lump we ask the managersupervisor how did they cook their karekar he said it pre made then they froze it then heat it whenev there an order that explain the lump lol

lumpiang ubod is noth without the peanut sauc it is so plain lack of ingredi and doesnt contain the real tast of lumpiang ubod 
 
we just got disappoint with the food and the price i dont know if were still come backi want to love this place and i will come back for a second opinion 

so we got here at 5pm on friday for some pizza and beer right off the bat we were told they could not make ani pizza tonight the bar side was moder busi but not overwhelm the waitress was knowledg about the beer and gave us some decent advis on what to order so we decid on a flight of beer as we look over the menu for someth besid pizza  we order the boneless spici buffalo wing and the chees and bacon fri we settl on a beer we like and wait for our foodand waitedand wait final when the food came out we dug into the fri they were pretti good then i ate one of the boneless chicken wing and low and behold no spici buffalo sauc just plain chicken i look for our waitress and she was nowher to be found we wait over 20 minut till we found her in fact three tabl had to hunt her down one for a refil on drink the other so they could talli their bill and depart and me becaus my order was wrong so get this she take the order back the cook just pour cold sauc on them and i get the same one back cold and toss in sauc bs who like cold chicken

 i dont blame the waitress and i understand the place is new and has to work out some kink but the first experi was  a bad experi 
understaf 
no happi hour special 
no pizza 
incorrect correct an incorrect order 
custom should not have to hunt down their server 

on a lighter not if you like wheat style beer i high recommend the sofie

i will tri this place again around the same time in about a month to see if it just the jitter of a new locat or a perman style of do busi 

follow up review to followhi today i purchas a 16 omelet and a 450 ice tea bc that the cheapest egg dish on the menu and i was unawar that such an amount could be charg for a tea bag in water and ice it been quit a few hour and im still annoy at this  

what happen to this place i love the 247 casino cafedin place where you can get some simpl dish at reason price flush that idea down the toilet here sure my omelet was ok the californian season roast veget egg white avocado but unless there are babi unicorn tear in it next time i wouldnt order it again mmm unicorn tear strip markup i get it but a 7 for a bagel with cream chees you suck  

ill be back drunk late night and let you know if 18 chicken finger are somehow worth the cost doubt it though skipthe newli open avenu 24 cafe insid the mgm grand had absolut no appeal except for it proxim to wet republ we end up stop in for a quick or not so quick lunch right befor day club and the whole experi was quit disappointing

th onli good part about the place is the servic our waiter was realli nice and friend everyth els pretti much suck first of i had want to order a salad but i just couldnt fork out 17 for a caesar or garden salad some thing on the menu are more reason price for the type of dish but be prepar to spend at least 20 or more per person

w wait for our food for almost 30 minut which creat a huge problem becaus we had a guestlist that was close at wet republ we end up have onli 10 minut to eat befor we had to rush out becaus it took the food so much longer than we expect to come out

th tast left a lot to be desir we had the skillet hash with green sauc and the short rib fri they both sound good in theori but both came out less than averag at best the hash didnt have good flavor and was over salti the fri didnt have enough top and the short rib also didnt tast like much

with so mani great place to eat in vega i would high recommend skip this mgm has a sandwich shop that suppos to be good and from the look of it the servic is a lot fastergrand open night at for good shake

sup long line to order super long wait for our shake

i chose the 599 mid kid in a candi shop  which consist of nonfat yogurt mms kit kat and twix  the husband chose the 599 mid strawberri shortstack which consist of nonfat yogurt pancak strawberri and strawberri syrup

th first thing i notic as i watch the employe pour out the shake was how super runni it was in retrospect i did see the blender befor they were blend and was faint awar that the yogurt was in a liquid form  ultim the yogurt never had a chanc to set up get cold and freez up a bit the machin were not prepar to handl the crowd the staff were basic blend a liquid base along with top and not for veri long i might add we end up throw our out and when i pour mine down the sink larg chunk of candi were still present the super larg straw were definit not a match for this runni shake  we didnt bring ani can good with us so we couldnt take advantag of their 50 off grand open special that 12 down the drain literally

what made this experi even wors was the fact that the husband got sick he was on the toilet throughout the night and morn and even tri go to work ala he came home earli to continu the toilet visit in the comfort of our own home i dont think it was the yogurt that made him sick but perhap the pancak were what did it  sad i dont think hell ever want to set foot back into that place again too bad as i love their three squar connect of donat a meal for everi shakesmoothi purchased

th grand open was nice with music face paint and game and the staff were nice too  perhap they should have stop sell and just given out sampl that were the right consist  qualiti control wasnt there that even and the employe should have spoke up when they saw how runni the yogurtshak werei hate give out bad reviewsespeci at place that my friend have enjoy  after all that is the reason whi we came here becaus we heard great things

let me start off say that the food was not bad  it just was not notabl in my eye and it felt expens  and i didnt even pick up the tab this time

first exampl moonen tater tot 9  overpr for the portion sizei think there were 9 or 10 tater tot in there  that is about 1 a tater totand no it not drench in truffl oil or accompani by a fanci aioli  the tast was just oknot veri memorable

brais oxtail croquett dijionnais 12 look like a mozzarella stick but it fill with oxtail and potato it was good just not like my bang for the buck here  

chicken pot pie nugget 11 natur jus with pea and carrot these were interestinggood differ but not great  i want someth to stand out  we arent eat at applebeesor spend applebe money

johnni dri age burger 18 i ask for doubl portion of truffl chees but it was not veri truffl like and tast dri like a goat cheesebriewhich i dont like at all sad becaus it ruin my burger  mayb if i had onli one chees it would have been more toler just dont compar this to todd english oliv truffl chees burger for instancenot the same burger or cheesenot even the same ballpark

th dessert were good pie americana 9 appl compot puff pastri vanilla ice cream and walnut fanci appl pie good flavor hereand the mahalo matcha panna cotta 10 green tea panna cotta macadamia nut tuil and passion fruit sorbet good combin of flavor but again noth realli stood out to me and it still felt a littl overpriced

seem like i am the minor hereeveryon els seem to like this place  but i have no reason whi i would go back and spend the cheddar

p so you have a fascin with steampunk and you feel like have some bar food for dinner well then it would be a huge mistak to come here dont say i didnt warn you

w arriv to find an almost empti restaur at 9 pm on a friday night  a telltal sign  but i was excit to check out this steampunkthem restaur that i long to visit i notic that the place has a few gear motif here and there and a few realli cool and exot sculptur besid that it was just an open space with tabl and chair alreadi i felt disappoint 

but the real disappoint came when our food arriv there were four of us and we order the bacon wrap bacon and egg oxtail stick chicken pot pie nugget chees charcuteri mac n chees and potato fri our whole parti like the oxtail and the bacon wrap bacon n egg but we could not get over the fact that these mediocr item were cost us almost 5 time the cost if we were to get these item elsewher 

i dont feel right pay 9 for a bucket of fri that tast exact like fri at mcdonald or pay 14 for a tini bowl of mediocr mac n chees 

if onli their drink were better to make up for the terribl eat experi but that would be ask too much of the rx boiler room as i order the some like it hot cocktail and was terribl disappoint at this drink as well 

stay away unless you just dont care about the price  or the food   and just want to come in to look at the cool sculpturthe fiancé and i are big fan of chef shawn mcclain other aria restaur sage have enjoy memor food and drink while there  given our past enjoy of his cuisin we decid to tri his newli open five50 pizza bar  our decis was made even more palat sinc wed gotten coupon for a free slice and beer from mgms myvega game on facebook  

we arriv around 6pm on a wednesday night  there was no line at the slice counter where pizza by the slice was sold  we note immedi that not all pizza avail in the sit down part of the restaur were avail by the slice  no matter sinc the gotham 550 per slice28 for a 16 pie a meat pizza top with pepperoni sausag salami mozzarella and grana padano was what i want and it was on the abbrevi slice menu  five50 slice are taken from their 16 pie which are divid into 8 piec so slice receiv arent veri larg  also sinc theyr prebak there no tell how long theyv been sit on the counter  my slice was pluck off of the counter and slid into the woodfir oven at what im assum was 550 degre to warm it up  a few minut later i receiv my slice  the crust was decent flavor crispi at the edg but not necessarili chewi throughout  i attribut most of the lacklust qualiti of the crust to the fact the pizza was prebak had cool down absorb the greas from the relat ampl amount of meati top result in the crust becom soggi and limp  i was pretti unimpress  my fiancé didnt fare much better with her select      

the beer select at the slice counter was also abbrevi with onli two beer avail on tap and a hand of bottl  it was also surpris unimpress with onli one of the beer avail a bottl dogfish head sound remot interest  unfortun they want 13 for it which combin with the slice of the pizza exceed the valu of the coupon  i couldv paid the differ but as a matter of principl id never pay 13 for a 12ounc bottl of beer

mi part thought was that five550 may be a veri good pizza joint with a solid craft beer select  perhap our luck wouldv been much better had we sat in the dine room order a whole pizza and tast a fresh bake pie  howev you wont get that experi by the slice at the walk up counter  it overpricedexpect to pay 16 for a beer and a slice and it sad underdelivit a shame a cri shame how do you mess up pizza clever name five50 the temp of the oven and the name shawn mcclain attach to this how can this be so bad i thought sage was terribl overr but i had high hope for five50 

we start out with a coupl app sampl four differ pie which we we abl to do halv on and finish with a few desserts

smal plates

pepperoni arancini rice ball red sauc and roast garlic aioli 12 three small arancini they were pretti good

pig and truffl pork shoulder cannelloni bordeaux spinach bechamel and summer truffl 18  im a sucker for bechamel that intrigu me more than the truffl this was pretti outstanding

signatur pizza are 16 

north beach clam smoke mozzarella sweet onion oregano by far one of the weirdest tast pizza ive ever had i think what threw me off the most was the sauc im use to a clam pizza with a white sauc the red sauc did not pair well even wors was the smoke mozzarella i felt like i was eat bbq it was terrible

blanca mozzarella ricotta bel paes white chedder oliv oil garlic basil this was decent the ricotta was the best part 

truffl truffl salami bechamel parmesan thyme shave truffl would you like a side of oil to go with that wow onli thing i saw on this pizza was oil someon call  the nearest cath lab and book a room for me i couldnt finish my slice it was terribl overwhelm 

margherita tomato buffalo mozzarella and basil this was pretti standard noth to write home about 

at 28 a pizza you walk away think did that realli just happen 

desserts

warm appl pie  french toast cube both made up for the horend pizza 
skip this placelet make this clear befor i begini love rakulov  that whi i was so excit to hear about this dessert bar open  i thought it was a fresh idea to have in vega  like the other review the restaur itself is spot on  all whitegreat plate glass tea pot tea cup silverwar they have a modern twist on them all  i was so close in snag a spoon for my ice cream at home lol  restroom was veri cool but i dont know how long that remot control toilet will last and i figur someon sooner or later will think the sink is a trash can but whatev it still veri cool

now let me get to the part whi i gave it 2 star  let get to the desserts

amuse
strawberri sorbet with mint jelli  this was a strawberri sorbet you could get anywher noth spectaculor about it  the mint jelli had no flavor and i feel was simpli there for textur  not impressed

apollo
raspberri mouss and a thin layer of custard in between two layer of chocol mouss top with fresh raspberri  again i did not see anyth great of this dish just a typic dessert you can get anywhere

marriage
strawberri mouss banana custard spong cake fresh berri white chocol and whip cream with gold leaf this look awesom but tast again like ani other dessert  truth the spong cake was dri and not that moist

petit four
chocol lava cake light dust with powder sugar raspberri marshmallow and passion fruit marshmallow cool idea with the flavor marshmallow but the chocol lava cake was too bitter and noth on the plate to balanc it  

i must add that i did think make the menu be edibl was fun and creativ  

i did receiv the goodi bag and i have to say that i was more impress with the goodi bag than what i had in the restaur  the madelin were kinda of dri but the almond brittl was realli good and the chocol cake was veri moisttast like there was fruit or someth insid and the chocol top had a nice snap to it  

base on the qualiti of raku i had extremem high expect and mayb that where it all went wrong  present is great but is the flavor or present better than say go to jean phillipno  these were realli just typic french style dessert  i was expect someth more creativ from raku use more inspir japanes or asian ingredicame here with my ladi and gentlemen and i think 5 of us opt for the pre fix menu while kristina order a la cart i ask for the appl pie to go with the sorbet and molten lava cake while everyth was good i find the item to be rather typic dessert item that one can get in a bakeri anywher the threespoon sorbet was good but realli it just sorbet nice and uniqu take on the appl pie that i have to give it to sweet raku final the molten chocol cupcak realli i can make that at home use my microwav in less than 5 minut how disappoint 

just a note on the utensil i know the knife and fork look veri eclect but they definit were not easi to use i could bare cut my appl pie with the knife and the fork was so awkward to handl i think it gave me finger cramp 

as for the servic the waitress serv us had such a strong accent i could bare make out what she said she was realli sweet and nice but if i couldnt understand what the heck she was say 

 at 27 includ tip this was a meh experi 

one time was enough im not plan on come backsweet raku should be secret rakuoh the difficulti find this place we were run around like it was a black op mission one person went to one corner the other was look around the block anoth was in the middl of the park lot tri to get a gps signal for locat we final found the place which is next to big wong phew wipe sweat off forehead

1 pointth present of the food was fanci but the tast was not a wow factor i had the appl pie with no ice cream so they substitut white chocol squar instead 

1 pointfriend staff and veri accommod our group of 6 want to sit at the counter and they made it happen

first and last time come here it to expens and the servic is slow and im lactos intoler most of the dish have heavi creamafter dinner dessert with friend on a saturday night we want to tri this place becaus of all the great review that peopl have been post it was a bit confus find the place sinc there is anoth restaur in the same lot with the name raku there was a line to get in when we arriv so we end up wait about 15 minut or so ask to be seat at the counter so you watch them prepar the food

ed menus  ok cute after look over the menu decid on pre fix sinc one of my dine mate recommend it

pros

 great present of the dessert so artsy
 clean almost steril appearance
 clean restroom with a toilet that has a proxim sensor open automatically
 friend smile staff

cons

 the price 40  gratuiti is automat tack on for dessert for 2 peopl no drink  what ok i see gold flake in some of the dessert that were serv to us doe that make it worth it well it look nice but i was still hungri when i left i dont rememb anyth particular special about it plus my wallet was a littl lighter
 ok restroom was clean but it took me a few second to figur out which object was the sink it look like a barrel of some sort
 i could bare understand what the server was say see below perhap they should use pictures
 it kind of feel like your in japan in a bad way which mean it is small and cramp and feel overcrowded
 get a sign for christ sake i know the giant spoon in the front is a visual cue but how mani peopl know to look for that and how visibl is that from the street it like go to a rave in an undisclos locat you wont know that your there unless you ask one of the other peopl wait in line to get in
 if you are lactos intoler cross this place off your list it seem like everyth made here is made from milk

summari imho

bang for the buck nope not here not to me at least hey that great that they can get away with charg almost 20 for someth that i can probabl figur out how to make at home for less than 10 and still have second or third serv i dont think ill be come back here  unless somebodi els insist on foot the billi know everyon and their momma are rave about what a wonder place this is  if you want a great wast of hard earn money sure honest ani dessert place on the strip will knock this place out of the map when it came to tast  the funniest thing is that almost everi review of this place onli talk about how the dessert look and how they are prepar bare ani of the review tell you how the food actual tast  and if your go to put ani sort of food in your mouth tast is pretti damn import duh

th good
th ambianc and the posh of the whole place veri ikeaish i think the bathroom take the cake for me pun intend  it was the most excit part of the whole thing and the preparationpresent of the food was pretti cool  

the bad
al smoke and mirror in this place  when it came to tast it wasnt even up to par with basic dessert you can make yourself  honest the onli thing this place has go for it is that they make the food look good so if you want to impress your friend on instragram or pintrest or your social media by all mean 25  tip is not too much i guess  but if you want to satisfi your crave for sweet and dessert this place is not it  

etc
th flavor textur and the complex of their menu item is veri bland and i felt like i was eat a bunch of flavor fondant except they left out the sweet and delect aspect of a dessert there no comfort in it  no warmth in the dessert  it was just plain and simpl okaytheyr direct across from giant offic build from which larg group of lunchseek eman is lunchseek a word i guess it is now

anyway our group of 10 was seat quick then not much happen then we got beverag my friend got a glass of water all over his shirt the server accident drop it on him the glass shatter on the floor it was ok accid happen and it was a hot day anyway the wet polo shirt provid a cool effect 

so we wait a while longer too long realli food start come out from the kitchen the server didnt know who order what it ok it happen really

it was standard chines lunch fare noth realli good or bad it ok it happen really

start to notic peopl at other tabl wait for food or drink or check it ok it happen really

they gave us the wrong check at the end it ok it happen really

w wait about 15 minut for a revis check to appear it ok it happen really

our lunch hour turn into a lunch hour and a half it ok it happen really

and to be honest i told the hostess that my friend with the wet shirt shouldnt be ask to pay for his lunch and she agre he didnt the manag might have been upset about this but   it ok it happen reallii was so excit to dine at pizza rock and i left so dissapoint  hubbi and i decid to tri the award win margherita pizza  the server was veri quick to make sure we knew that the pizza was thin and chewi and youd have to use two hand to pick up a piec  he also mention that becaus it cook over wood it will be slight charred
what we receiv was so far from an award win pizza we were speechless  the char was overwhelm and overpow ani other flavor that were part of the dough sauc or toppings
when we let our server know that we werent happi the situat was handl extrem well  the server loook at the pizza and then smell the pizza and let us know that there was definit someth wrong with the pizza that we were serv  they brought a second pizza this time we had the new yorker and it was pretti good  the manag went as far as to bring us a 2nd margherita pizza so we could see what the pizza was suppos to tast like  it was still overchar on one side but we could defint tast the flavor  to be honest i still wasnt impress with this pizza
whil we end up not have to pay for our meal which i thought was veri nice and it was unexpect on our end i thought the price were high for a pizza joint  so while the staff and manag definit recov nice from their error in the end i just dont see what all the hype is aboutpizza rock give me the impress that a bar has acquir a massiv space and scale itself appropri tvs everywher dark and noisi ambianc a menu full of bar food

first what i like two thing synonym with bars
 spacious
 lot of tvs if your into what theyv got on

so i can appreci the chang downtown it is now becom  a place that peopl wont mind be in when the sun set pizza rock is a nice look place and help that sort of downtown project effort what it doesnt help like le thai is elev their own form of food if anyon ask me ill say it a huge bar that has huge pizza noth more

w share romana 1 it one of three giant pizza that state itll feed a few peopl for appet calamari and rosemari fries

 the calamari extrem overbatt otherwis it exact what youd expect

 the fri were fri exact as youd expect

 the romana it amaz they have the nerv to charg 35 for an otherwis xxl chees pizza in a rectangular shape it was so spars on top that it hit a nerv for exampl the end of the pizza with the balsam and prosciutto had liter portion out a small piec of prosciutto and a coupl drop of balsam it was scant and flavorless actual id say the whole thing was stale wasnt even hot when we got it the chees wasnt melti the crust wasnt crispi the whole thing just wasnt qualiti it almost tast frozen that gummi sort of textur was present

to put the romana in perspect if you went to settebello youd pay around 1215 per pizza a qualiti pizza distinct qualiti if you order three expens one youd equal one of these romana feed more peopl and make them happier if you went to nake citi pizza the bar for bar pizza youd be abl to buy a frickin huge specialti pie again feed more peopl with pipe hot fresh and flavor make everyon happier

id never be back but one last thing

i miss the elit event not too long ago and im glad i did becaus had i written this review there it would have just been lost in the useless wave of 5star that just say we saw friend thank for the free food even though we had to wait a long time come now elit review the place dont throw out 5 star for free food it help nobodi unless pizza rock was just sold on bring elit in to start a buzz i imagin they could have valu some honest feedback from the communiti so i wouldnt have to hammer their mediocr todayno


thi order as you walk in pay there includ a tip and have the food deliv to your tabl concept is aw and confus and no bueno  

the food at red devil is delici ill state that for the record  

the stand there and decid what your whole tabl want to eat and drink as peopl queue up behind you and out the door idea is aw  and to make matter wors sinc the person run the food out to the tabl are they a waiter a food deliver has no idea what you order at the regist so when you mention that you also place a to go order to take to someon at home you can expect a lot of confus between the food deliver the kitchen and the person at the cash regist  what a frig mess  

ill stick with the old fashion sit down red devil restaur thankeveri time we go here the bouncer tri to mess with me ive had them go so far as to tell me there was a warrant out for my arrest after they scan my id which is not funni becaus some scanner realli can pick that up if theyr not pull someth like that theyr check my pictur against my face for a good minut befor decid it not a fake 

this last time though realli irrit me i hand this duck dynasti wannab my id and watch him read it i guess that was suspici becaus he look up from it and stare at me intent i stare right back and appar he didnt like that becaus he then ask where are you come from  oh the tim mcgraw concert  he get this super serious look how much have you had to drink

which realli tick me off becaus i had not had one singl sip of alcohol all night

noth at all   
phil jr stare at me some more and final let me in but i remain annoy for the rest of the even 

be treat like your underag with a fake or alreadi drunk when your not get realli old when it everi singl time you get to a barthis place is clean staff is welcom but i honest was veri disappoint and still scratch my head at how this place has 5 star we came on a friday night hope to get a quick meal in befor my boyfriend basketbal game he had the spinachchees stuf ravioli and i had an alfredo dish the pasta was cook veri poor and was veri clumpi it seem like we could have made better at home the alfredo seem veri oili the bacon i had ad to it was spars and lack flavor and the ravioli was unappet we also had an order of garlic knot that they forgot about but onc we did get them they were underwhelm and both the sauc and the bread lack a lot of flavor my fianc is normal a garbag dispos when it come to leftov but after pack up most of our food and take it togo we end up throw it away the next day i think this place is still work out some kink ie the cashier seem to forget to give a lot of tabl their utensil which the runner had to end up do i do appreci that they make their pasta fresh and they have fresh herb grow inhous but noth about our experi made us want to go back it look like the place has a lot of fan though and im sure will continu to thrive and improv 

great concept but i think i will be stick to custom built pizza when it come to my customiz italian food needone i want an american cheeseburger

i will play the simpl pros and con game with this one 

pros 


con 
price
ala carte
grey burger not flame grilled
odd seat 
uneduc about the food bar tender
no captain morgan at all onli some local kingman rum caus kingman is know for the rum

seri the burger was good flavor but the textur and and color were off i realli realli want to like it it was a good size of gray meat uggh

if you are like me and want a good cheeseburg go to bobbi qs and get eh smokehous burger medium rare it rockwhi me jesus whi me 

so i didnt actual say that but that how i felt after eat here when everybodi els appar had the time of their live we roll in on a friday night and saw the below  

 parti of a lot of peopl in the dine room ok a crowd is a good sign
 seat at the sushi bar on a friday night with no wait ill take it 
 huge fish to rice ratio that my attempt at low carb 

we sat down at the sushi bar and our server came by with our drink pretti quick and we hit the ground run with our order at this point in the stori it import to note that on a friday night with a massiv group that took up half of the restaur there were onli two sushi chef not for the sushi bar i mean for the whole place 

i gave them the benefit of the doubt for the first few order becaus i knew that a group of that size could definit put a dent in the oper but after our request kept get sidetrack time after time it becam frustrat as we saw our order get plate with more focus on the present than the servic speedon to see it get serv to someon els this was on top of the fact that a few of our order were also lost  not just at the sushi bar but in the kitchen too those bulgogi nacho that i final muster up the courag to tri ill never know how they tast becaus they never hit the tabl 

ehh so mayb this was an isol incid  i can see that happen im will to give it anoth shot but with so mani other ayc sushi option avail around town it go to be a while befor i swing by againeveryth here is edibl but noth was great there was onli one waitress work so we had to sit ourselv and ask for someth sever time the nigiri and roll are small becaus of the low price sinc the whole menu is 50 off for dinner our parti order a bunch of nigiri and roll unfortun i didnt like ani of the item except for the sashimi roll and miso soup 

probabl will not come backyou know those seafood place that smell like seafood but not in the good way  this seem to be one of those place from my first visit here the first impress this place left on me waswel  that fishi smell not off to a good start myself and a few cowork stop here for lunch as it is a relat new locat that did not open too long ago i figur they would have their best foot forward  sure hope that was not the case 

cant rememb the name of the server we onli saw him 3 time dure the whole visit 1 bring water and take order 2 drop off food 3 drop off check  now let me clarifi i do not expect to be serv like a king i am not a nose up type of person howev when we had to ask for a refil on drink from a differ server that happen to be walk by then i start to question the service

thi bring me to the food part of the drink refil debacl was due to the fact that all of the food we order was over salti we were all parch and need larg amount of water to wash down the food the fri soft shell crab was not veri impress scrawni littl guy 90 shellbread 5 meat 5 greasesalt the fri were not bad but they were noth to write home about either the potato salad was pretti good 

i will probabl give this place anoth shot as everi place has it off day im just hope that this was an off day and not the standard at crab corneryeah for anoth place in town serv thrifti ice cream  drool

so if i was just write on the ice cream it would be 5 star easi  this shop has 35 flavor to choos from at ani time  cali serv the wonder yummi thrifti ice cream that we all rememb and cherish from childhood  on this visit we had the birthday cake and mediev mad flavor  the birthday cake ice cream tast just like a vanilla cake with vanilla butter cream frost with some sprinkl thrown in  the mediev mad flavor is a vanilla ice cream with 3 musket candi bar mix in  both were creami and delici  yum

now for the bad part  the shop is not visibl from the street  if you are look for it you have to hope to see the ice cream flag out front on the main street  it is incred hard to find  whi becaus the busi is in a weird build that seem to be an odd shape apart build  it is on the bottom floor in the back corner of this build  

you go insid and everyth seem cram in there  the staff isnt super friend and made me feel uncomfort just be in there  there are no seat or chair or anywher to sit and eat your ice cream  we had to just take it and eat in the car becaus there is absolut no where to sit unless you go insid someon apartment

ther is almost no park for this build becaus it is fill up with the resid car  there were 5 park spot in total  i was lucki to get one spot in the back  it was easi get in but extrem hard to get out  i drive a midsiz sedan and still need someon to help me get out of the spot due to the weird pole bad park of other and a random gate in the way  the whole build has a strang set up

also there seem to be some unsavori peopl hang out on the upstair balconi  i wouldnt want to come here at night by myself  

the onli reason i would come back is if my mom want to come sinc it is near her hous  this wouldnt be my first choic by far for ice cream on this side of townplace was pretti dead for a friday night
their dinein area was so big but so empti so girlfriend and i sat at the bar

w were greet and help by eric throughout the whole night i would say he made the experi ok enough for us to stay

w were definit turn off when both bartend at the bar had no clue what cocktail they have we stuck with the simpl thing moscato mai tai peach on the beach sparkl moscato and our mix drink that includ absolut peach vodka pineappl and sprite which usual is with ciroc peach but they didnt have the wine was wine a coupl of our cocktail as my friend had put it shouldv been drank at the club it was too strong for our littl pallet lol

now let talk food i wasnt impressed
first round we had 
 stuf date  ive never seen such huge date which wasnt a good thing in this situat had so much blue chees where that all you tasted
 mango chicken  the dish had grill chicken with some type of mango salsa bland no special flavor and had some type of kick to it
 crab cake  i like this dish out of the three the look of it was weird becaus it look like a hamburg parti but crab was chunki and the sauc pair with it realli well although ive had much better crab cake this was good

second we order buffalo chicken wings
they were good to me but it fri chicken with ad buffalo sauc you cant mess that up you get 5 decent size wing with not too much buffalo sauc and a side of ranch 

last we blame the alcohol for have to order more food we order meatbal slider and shrimp ceviche
 meatbal tast like someth from a can or those frozen one plus they were realli small for the size of bun they chose i like my meatbal waaay bigger and made with real ground beef
 the cevich came with tostito nacho chip had good amount of shrimp to say the least it was ok

overal  food was mediocr and bland drink were drink noth special and our bartend was realli friend funni and attent ¯ツ¯im not sure how this place got a 4 star im veri picki when it come to pho mayb that the viet in me or the fact that noth compar to my mom pho 

this place has horribl servic which is unfortun sinc the food is pretti decent it took us 20 minut just to get some water and menus when we got our menus they want to take our order right away on the spot um can i look at my menu first 

i order the rice with bbq pork so com suon nuong yummi my famili order pho by the time they got their dish i was alreadi done with mine my thai tea had more ice in it than actual thai tea if it wasnt for my famili id never come back herei was veri happi to see pei wei open at the airport
it was realli a big deal sinc all the other asian restaur shut down there
major disappointment
first of all onli a few item to choos from which mayb is understand sinc they need quick food readi to go
howev it is most all the realli fatti food so i got a salad that was pre made
high price but i know it is the airport
i had to wait for the girl to come to ring me up she was angri and not happi to be there and way too  busi talk to the other worker there about their person life

that drive me crazi plus i was the onli one there at that moment
th 60 second that it take to ring me up my order should not take away from your person chatter  plus i had to ask for a bag
when i did eat the salad it was full of white lettuc and the spine of the lettuc whi do restaur alway do that now
th spine of the lettuc should never be in the salad ever
i will say and mean it i will never visit this place again in the airport
becaus i realli like pei wei normali did not have time to prepar dinner last night so i hit up brat und brau for some carryout food  there not a wide varieti of restaur on madison north side so i was hope to find a decent new dine spot close to home  i order the fish dinner and a grill chees for my daughter

unfortun it was not the kitchen best perform  it seem like the staff just assembl and warm sysco ingredi  the kitchen did not appli much in the way of creativ or techniqu to either dish

th fish dinner 1299 suffer from a lack of season and a lack of ani textur  the bread was bland and lack ani crunch the textur of the fish also was mushier than other fish fri ive had  the small serv of tartar sauc suffer from the same lack of season  i could not detect ani lemon or herbs

on the other hand the cottag fri were soggi and had far too much salt  while the portion size was generous i was unabl to finish them

th slaw look promis and ad some muchneed crunch to the meal  howev it just had an off tast and i quit eat it after a coupl of bite  

the dinner roll was a standard issu roll for a fish dinner  noth spectacular but i enjoy it

mi daughter enjoy for grill chees 299 especi the cheddar chees  they actual grill the sandwich becaus the griddl had been turn off the sandwich had grill mark and the chees was melt through  other than the over salti fri it was a great meal for the price  my daughter prefer this grill chees sandwich over was she get from culvers

th order process was effici and the staff was friend when i pick up the food  i also am a fan of ani place that offer free popcorn

despit the mediocr food this visit i will tri brat und brau again becaus of my posit interact with the staff and a streak of nostalgia  howev ill stick to the bratwurst and request the kitchen go easi on the saltjustin the bartend was veri rude  this is a low class joint  shouldnt male bartend wear shirt with sleev  it would be nice if new meant improv and not just higher price  i love their bloodi mari  i consid bacon to be most a breakfast food  it is not someth i usual eat for lunch or dinnerafter anoth  amaz  meal  at monta ramen the gf and i decid to hit snowflak given the posit review from a slew of yelper  well dang it sad to say we walk away bewild at our disappoint in our first  and like last  visit to sfs  in fact it bother me  which has never happen befor  that our experi differ so much from other  was it simpli a bad day for sfs   i doubt it sinc sever peopl eat in the shop were clear pleas with what they were eat  also while watch the guy prepar our snow i can actual see the pride in the product  
did we order the wrong item  i went with the cooki mix and the gf went with a strawberri cheesecak mix  the strawberri was ok but for the most part we had the same opinion of both  we remind us of our youth eat ice milk  i  we  didnt like it when we were kid and we dont like it now  not to say that sfs serv us ice milk  mayb it is  heck if i know  
is snow an acquir tast   or mayb the tast bud are final shot  not sure but when it all said and done  we didnt like it 

heck now im afraid to tri the raku dessert place  will i be disappoint in that  too one word review meh

thre word review meh at best


i was pretti excit to tri this place obvious i had my initi bbq in vega skeptic but then it seem to get a lot of posit review on yelp i live close to the red rock so have a good bbq joint in the neighborhood would of been pretti awesom 

we arriv around 6pm and the place was pretti empti not a good sign sinc the red rock itself was pretti pack despit be near empti it still took about 10 minut to get a tabl as the 3 staff work the door discuss the conundrum of where to sit us over their headset with the mothership it was anoth 10 minut befor someon took our order 

want to tri a bunch of stuff we decid to get the app sampler which includ sweet potato fri fri pickl rib tip okra chicken tender some sort of southern egg roll sausag link and some other unidentifi food stuff it was all about the qualiti you would expect from make the same item at home in 1 oven at the same time by just guess at what temperatur would best suit all item sweet potato fri were mushi fri pickl were tough rib tip had bone in them and were tough sausag was cold overal veri dissapointing

i also order the brisket chili which was on the special menu figur after the app platter i wouldnt be abl to tackl a whole rack of rib perhap an error i admit the chili was just veri bland and onli lukewarm the cornbread that came with it was veri dri 

throughout the meal servic was slow and despit the jar they bring the water in be enorm i was frequent without a drink which is a pet peev for 24 dollar a person it was on the expens side for bbq with low qualitidisappoint on sever level  first the good news  servic was incred as was the ginger beer thyme infus cocktail  order it at the bar and dont ventur ani further  now onto the bad news  octopus appet that everyon rave about  over spice and serv with a tentacl so huge it look like a prop from a richard basehart submarin movi  back off on the salt boy  it was pickl in it  bone in ribey was tasti but greasi as were the short ribs

brussel sprout remind me of the crusti remnant of some experiment casserol  like what at the bottom  whi screw with one of natur most beauti food  the whip potato were definit whip  into a verit soup that look more like babi food than a proper side dish

if you feel like a steak id recommend stack  onli a few step further into the casino with a better menu and ambienc  did i mention that the music was not dine appropri and annoying

i just didthe restaur is beauti the food is veri good will i be back i dont realli think so 

this is a veri interest review to write becaus while the food was quit good as well as the fact that the restaur is on the cut edg of modern design i left feel somewhat disappoint 

it veri appar that sammi is attempt to be the new trendi hot spot in the neighborhood the comfort place where you can go to get pizza salad and sunda as an entir famili is no more while all that is still on the menu and those select are the same as they use to be tapa take the forefront 

the decor is gorgeous but the flaw outweigh the beauti there are too mani tabl for the space avail and the larg modern wicker chair dont made it ani easier to maneuv through the restaur i was sit in a seat where i could see everyon come into the restaur and be seat there was liter not enough space to get to your seat as in the hostess had to actual move a tabl to allow for the custom to get through i felt bad for the older custom as well as the bigger custom in there as it was appar that they were have a veri difficult time get to their seat and then leav afterward 

the food was good but factor the price sort of disappoint im awar that finer ingredi make the meal cost more i have no problem go to a lawri or a joe stone crab becaus i feel that what i get justifi the price but 12 for a singl crab cake that just petit and took two peopl sit at my tabl a cumul of three bite to finish is just unfulfil sammi is tri to be the next firefli minus the salmonella but what you get just doesnt cut it

sammi is desper tri to be the trendiest place in all of green valley but if i want to get tapa or a highqual dinner and enjoy a great time with friend i want to be in a place that welcom and there are far better option 

it seem that sammi is do everyth right on paper but isnt factor the most import element to a restaur make the custom feel at homenot bad coffe but the littl chef guy need to learn some manner and respect i get that your enthus about your store but when i mention im a regular at the roasteri in the same mall and was check this place out he sigh and said yeah they arent veri good lesson number 1 dont ever do that

bad etiquett and poor tast follow by watch him interrupt our order flirt with the counter girl and caus her to take almost 10 min for a latt when place was empti i will not be returning

2 star for patio and a good product hope they can learn some better servic as the roasteri has them at this point big timewhat a disappoint at bombay spice grill tonight we were fan of the full servic restaur that oper nearbi but the chang to fastcasu miss the mark complet i am go to assum that the restaur group behind the treasur roka akor and nobuo is no longer affili with bombay spice 

what a chang from the attent server and the well thought out menu the hip decor and care program music the place has all the vibe of the dmv with glare cfl light and spare decor this just open and the wall had mark and the floor was worn in spot the serv plate and utensil seem to be of the lowest grade while the napkin were just a littl larger than a paper bar napkin and not as soft the hot samosa melt the tine of the fork 

we went there know that they made the chang to the concept i get the chipotl  style order and was abl to figur out what i want i had chicken masala over rice while the ladi had the same with steak plus veggi we also order one naan and some samosa we both found that the rice was old and dri and the meat overcook the naan was half a piec cut in half the samosa were dri and overcook and werent readi until we were about to leav we were nickel and dime for all these extra includ sauc 

bombay spice i will give you one more tri in a month if the food is betteril consid you an altern to the sub shop next door ill order a 700 plate of food youll never sell me ani goalong and ill never bring a group of friend as i did with the old concept your not a cool wine bar with healthier indian food anymor 

also dont eat outsid that park lot has smell like sewer sinc 1985bummer  6 for a cappuccino  had hope if this place was go to charg such price that they could deliv someth that would make you want to return  pay italian price for a cafe drink it would at least tast as good as the café of itali boy was i disappoint  the barista didnt know what they were do  

if a place is go to charg high price for a product they should know what they are do definit wont be come backgotta go with liz b on this one i just dont like it 

much of this could be what i order so ill most certain be back to tri the thing that folk here have rave about but the posit review make me wonder if im miss someth the salsa is rough wateri flavorless id rather have pace and the chicken fajita have no flavor i dont understand throw meat onto a scream hot skillet and your certain to build up a nice crust on the the outsid but nada the rice and bean follow suit bland and bore again mayb im not order the right thingit jazz night good incent to come in we order and 27 minut pass listen a crepe take just a coupl minut at most then ingredi which are like readi to go pile in 27 minut elaps though we just pay for our drink and leave

it seem to me that just a few peopl run the whole oper  poor just one chef just one waitress just one cashier veri veri slow and also veri expens i saw what the crepe were on anoth tabl and they are a long shot from justifi a 1011 value

il definit redo this review after actual have a crepeim have a tough time score this experience
i think had it not been bare a week old i would have given this one star but be so new i am will to give benefit of the doubt
so and this complet make sens cart arent allow in the restaur i didnt think of that befor hand next time i know to come here befor i start my shopping
it seem the restaur has a seat yourself concept not a big deal right well it not a big deal if the staff are pay attent to new peopl that come in that way we dont have to flag someon down to bring them menus after sit there for 15 minutes
our food took a littl over twenti minut to get we start by order a chees platter green chili chees fri and pretzel bread with chees dip a glass of wine and a glass of tea  about five minut after order my friend ask if she could order an addit item to go and ask that it be brought at the end of the meal and was told yes
so our food final come and it is all to go the server acknoledg the mistak right away but didnt make the effort to replat our item befor serv us
addit we never got the fri though we did get charg for them after she took the fri off our bill the total came to about 2516 if i rememb correctly
i gave my card and she took it to charg me when she brought my card and the receipt back she had charg me for a differ ticket onli a few cent higher 2587 but clear not my receipt even though my card number was on it we had had enough at this point and let it be
annoy thing about the receipt is as theyr not set up to requir signatur on purchas under 50 so there is no place to sign which appar also mean no room to leav a tip yes we tip so we were stuck pay a cash tip with all the money i had in my wallet 265
overal it definit was not the best servic far beneath what i would expect from whole food but i feel they deserv a second chanc everyon has their off days
i will say i felt everyth was veri reson price and the price were great on wednesday the chees plate and a glass of wine is 10 which mean my 6 glass of wine was freeit a tricki locat to find or find park in but onc i was there i admir the atmospher and let the waiter talk up the product sinc it was my first visit 

would you like to tri a pizza start with our vegan crust

mi vegetarian dine companion salivated

and top off with our mozzarella blend and a coupl meat items

at this point i was confus by the angl of this place and how this dinner was go to turn out if your not vegan you dont care that the crust is if you are whi are you advertis top made from anim first fortun read the menu unveil all the cool option and substitut and whatnot you can tri pizza that are 100 vegan you can also load your up with meat with tradit choic like the testosteroni 

at my most hungri i am not an adventur diner so i order that but first my monkey bread appet the bread itself is good and the garlic superb they could tone down the butter a bit though there shouldnt be a pool of it at the bottom of the basket overkill

a for the pizza theyr about 10 and 10 inch the crust amaz great stuff the sauc forgett the mozzarella and whatev it blend with was also bland the parmesan shaker had to come to the rescu the top were also pretti lame leav me to wonder if they just scrape the top off a frozen pizza and put them on a realli awesom crust 

the bar here is okay i like to see some of the lesserknown tap select like raj my cucumb rickey was disappoint i expect a rickey to pack a punch while at the same time be light and refresh their was pack with way too much syrup and i struggl to finish it if your familiar with my review you know most drink dont scare me away

i can understand whi this product was success in the mobil food busi if i were out at first friday or some bar id glad pay to have their person pie on the go but when im sit down in a stylish establish i expect a littl better than what is obvious fast food qualiti we could just as easili go to hanni or the parlor for a pizzacocktail combo at a similar price rang mayb if i tri more exot top id have like it better mayb i should tri their varieti of food besid pizza mayb ill give this place anoth tri but not befor explor the ton of other new spot in central phoenixafter read most of the review i was a bit skeptic of come here but to be fair i got to give these guy a chanc so i can verifi on my own

from my observ they still need a littl more work the build they are in is not well lit at all their sign by the road and on the actual restaur is pretti small so if you are not activ look to the side of the road you will not know this place exist come from the park lot there is no clear path go to the entranc becaus of how the landscap is there are a bunch of small bush you have to make your way around

when you enter you cant help but smell a certain odor it not strong but enough for you to notic the onli way i can describ it is that it almost smell rancid this alon will not make me want to come here that much sooner they have about 8 tabl insid and about 4 outsid 

their menu is pretti much self explanatori you got your basic burger and sandwich along with salad and kid meal on their take home menu everyth is the same except for the breakfast section that just it they dont serv breakfast not at all i ask at least two peopl behind the counter whi is it on the take home menu they said they use to serv breakfast but stop do it i ask whi and they couldnt answer me lame it shouldnt be on the menu then

they also advertis that they have free wifi anoth fail i did a search and there was a wimpi wifi signal so i tri to connect to it the signal was so weak that my phone could not hook up to it at all talk about a wimpi signal pun intended

so enough of the negat there is actual a light at the end of the tunnel not veri big but enough to warrant mentioning

i order the pastrami burger meal which come with fri and a drink total came out to around 8 buck and some chang not bad for a 13 pound patti with a decent amount of pastrami also came with onion tomato mayo and lettuc the best way i can describ the fri are that they a littl smaller than steak fri imo i think the fri need a littl more work kind of bland i thought and that was with salt too

servic was pretti good the onli thing that would bring it down would be if the place was pack becaus you onli have one regist so that would slow thing down a lot busi hour are sunday through thursday 9 am to 11 pm and 9 am to midnight friday and saturday 

so in close i think the onli save grace was the burger i got it was actual pretti good a nice size and it fill me up if you are in the north side of vega check it out and let me know if anyth has chang just dont go out of your way to come here of cours i will make anoth trip in the distant futur hope that thing will onli get better until then 2 staragain it monday busi studi for exam at lie librari and i spot the food truck line up on campus i came across lobsta trap and i want to see what it was about the menu was all salad with lobster run at about 13 i was skeptic about buy a lobster salad and spend that much for it  not be what i expect the last item on the chalk board menu was a lobster mac and chees for 6 so i order it it was serv on a cardboard contain like the kind you get french fri at fair pile high i saw the guy serv the mac and chees and top it off with store bought french onion cajun spice chive and a huge chuck of lobster it look delish but in realiti it was not all that the mac and chees was cold it was over cook pasta noodl with no flavor or chees the tastiest part were the french onion becaus the whole mac and chees need some salt and it was just clump of flour the lobster tast like imit crab but it was real lobster too cold to be on a hot dish like mac and chees honest i was onc again disappoint by a food truck the price were decent for lobster dish but not decent for what they realli are i do want to tri their lobster roll lobster sandwich mayb ill chang my mind all about second chancinterest concept and aboveaverag pizza ruin by possibl the rudest owner of an eat establish i have ever encount and his rude wasnt even direct at me

il kick this off with the huge negat for this experi the owner  as i approach the front of the line and my time to order he step behind the counter and start replac some food item he notic someth wrong not sure what and proceed to loud berat his employe right in front of me and everyon els in line follow that ouburst he assum one of the posit on the line and start put top on pizza as request by the custom one of those custom my friend right behind me my friend godforbid couldnt hear what the owner was say to him and it was our first time there as well and veri loud rude and in a veri condescend way repeat himself it was so awkward and uncomfort that my friend onli got a coupl of the top he want so that he could discontinu the exchange

not to the owner this is not new york citi and this is not a soup kitchen and this is not a seinfeld episod  you are wound veri tight and make what should be a funpleas experi one that isnt i feel sorri for your employe who have to take your verbal abus in front of custom  your rude to my friend was unnecessari  you are in the wrong busi there are other commentsreview that also make mention of your rude your food is pretti good but certain not at the expens of such poor servic  also your employe were kick tail behind the counter they were all friend and they were all fast and accur i would have quit on the spot right  in your face if you spoke to me like that in front of custom you could use some training

a for the food it was aboveaverag i had my own creation and enjoy it  the salad we got was veri good  thank there are mani equal good pizza spot throughout the valley  i wont be return here for the reason state abovi hate write negat review if im eat out i tri to prescreen place for qualiti base on review or reput but this place was new im alway look for good authent asian food in madison and i was feel korean food

cam for dinner i had a realli awkward seat my guest and i had to sit almost touch knee on the window seat becaus there wasnt enough leg room and the back of her seat was right up against the guest behind her

interior decor is strang  it tri to be a bit classier than it is

food was veri mediocr and overpr   i order the dduk galbi basic a korean version of salisburi steak that was dri and lack in flavor  my friend beef bul go gi was dri and tough banchan kimchi and cucumb were just ok  rice qualiti was mediocre

th spinach namul small plate was 6 and i serious onli receiv 23 tablespoons

for 1213 entre you should expect much more decent qualiti in madison  i didnt tri the galbijjim fancier short rib or the jiga stew i might give this place a second chanc and tri one of them or the bibimbap but it realli hard to mess up bibimbap 

servic was veri friend and decent attent consid the place is fair new too bad the food wasnt better

overal this is veri homestyl noth fanci korean food that is mediocr and overpr in an atmospher that doesnt quit fit  theyr new so mayb if the food improv in the come week and price went down a bit id give them anoth chanc  mayb if i were here for lunch and had paid less id feel a bit better but the food was still weak regardless for now if you want korean food in madison new seoul is better or learn to cook korean food at home or drive to chicagoi want to like this place consid it stand alon as an organ gluten free restaur but here the issu 

first off it tini and not at all comfort to eat in  i get that it go for a hipster vibe which i like but the plastic chair are just not fun to sit in  the decor is cool otherwis  

ok now for the menu  it limit but they do make their own pizza dough which is uniqu around here  the pizza is good  the pasta on the other handit bland  ive tri a coupl differ one and they are not at all interest  i order the 
cecca which is basic pasta with tomato basil and shrimp  i told the server i was allerg to shellfish so could i replac with chicken  didnt know that meant he was go to add 4 to the total  so my 16 pasta with tomato and shred chicken turn into 20 and it sure didnt tast like a 20 pasta  

mi friend ask for a vegan pizza  server brought her one with cow chees  she ask to make sure it was vegan when it arriv and he said yeah o wait you want vegan chees  wellhow much is on there  impli she could scrape it off 

i get so annoy when place that are suppos to cater and pride themselv on serv allergi friend food act all inconvenienc when they make a mistak and you cant eat it  sorri i just dont want to die or anythingmi bad plus im save you th troubl of have to carri my lifeless bodi out the back

h brought her a new pizza i ate while we wait for her  didnt offer to take my pasta back to keep warm didnt take anyth off the bill  just awkward

i understand that this is the onli option for gluten free organ in vega but sooo not impress  these place are all over la and ny so i was excit but o so let down  

mediocr servic blandok food not comfi pricey  passi came here for the first time they the drive thruth popolo girl that took my order was rude she also forgot my coconut bark so i went in to get it she had some attitud when i walk in and show her my receipt she just kept ask me if it was in the receipt i said i just went thru the drive through and she repeat it back to me to which she ask if it was on the receipt that i was show hersh saw it and gave me the bark with no apologiesjust attitudfirst  let me confirm that this establish has not 1 but 2 restroom   one for ladi and one for men   a fellow yelper and i exchang messag about this befor i went becaus that yelper review state that bei doe not have a restroom for custom  it doe   the sign out front is for noncustom  i snap a pic of the restroom sign as evid for other read review and consid this establish becaus i almost bypass this restaur becaus of that yelper inform i hope this helps

lat  i have been into ramen and brothi soup in general   miso shrimp and pork ramen to be specif   take a look at the pictur of my ramen httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbeiscottsdale2selectedovacabgi3p5bfbuibyq9kaxsczojjtqavoxmeqcy19yw and view the pic of the ramen post by yelper britt c  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbeiscottsdale2selectedovacabgi3p5bfbuibyq9kagx2zzuvy5ynzbud27blpa  they look quit differ   mine had a few tini piec of meat a limit amount of veggi and lack adequ broth   i hate it  i can honest say the 25 cent pack of ramen i made in colleg was better  the veggi tast can i expect a nice piec of pork in the ramen like the aforement pictur by britt c but there were onli a few flavorless tini piec a well known improvis restaur that has month ramen night down the street has ruin my palat to toler ramen ani place els   i can not say how much i hate that dish   

i order a spici sushi roll that i split with a fellow yelper  decent roll  i would like to tri the bei roll one day 

i went here with the intern lunch group that i organ   everyon els order a bento lunch box  they were all happi with their lunch and had a consensus 3 star meal

ther were 6 of us  we were automat charg a 20 gratuiti   i dont know if this is normal for everyon or if that is the case for group   it was not print on the menu   it aggrav me  but ala wasnt a big deal   they should print that on their menu

2 star  i hate my dish

becaus the locat is cool for me for easi access to sushi in soscott but consid the proxim of other sushi resto that i like better
return factor 15 

hot as hell wouldv rather spent the 8 on foodi fest entri line to get ramen and bevg ticket then line to order even though they all onli have 1 thing then anoth line to pick up then burn the sht out of your hand on the plastic bowl ok size portion but no ramen was amaz save  and go to sora instead 

off to snowflak to cool downdont realli understand the appeal of this place chicken was fine but certain noth worth rave about and with noth els on the menu other than the strip or sandwich made with strip there just realli isnt much to say here

their signatur cane sauc meh wouldv love some bbq sauc anyth to add a littl spice and flavor to some relat bland chicken 

i dont realli understand whi peopl would bother pack this place out when chick fil a is across the street unless it sunday of coursa dinner for four peopl cost 200 for a neighborhood spot we just couldnt imagin eat here regular they did a great job with the interior and it seem like a fun spot for after work drinks

plus the slider and oxtail
our server was person he end up in the weed and we had to get his attent multipl time for dish and the check

con the grill shrimp and salmon had veri littl flavor
it took 5 minut to get our first few tapa dish lead us to think that they had been sit under a heat lamp and 45 minut to get our last two tapa dishit a great concept  no more argu over what kind of asian to get everybodi can have the asian cuisin they want in one place unfortun executionnot so good i feel kind of bad leav 2 star  i want to like this place sinc the server and chef were veri sweet unfortun 3 out of 3 thing we order were not veri good and it doubt that ill give this place anoth tri 

shoyu ramen was bland and pretti tasteless pad see ew was decent but the sauc was weird sweet i didnt care for the flavor but my friend who had never had pad see ew anywher els said it was pretti good the roast duck soup w ramen had a fair amount of boneless roast duck but like the pad see ew the flavor of the broth was extrem sweet the noodl in both soup were also soft and slight overcook 

other review seem overal posit so mayb we just chose the wrong thing to tri i wont be back but world noodl is mayb worth tri if you research what good anoth thing to note is that the major of the pic on yelp are post by the busi so theyr stage not realli user pic the yelp app doesnt show who post pic so i didnt know until i got to the restaur and saw the same pic print in their menu a littl misleadwe were realli excit for a new hot n juici closer to our hous  weve been to the other 2 locat in vega and love them  so we had high hope for the new one on eastern

th décor look fantast they basic gut the whole space and it veri modern look  comfort seat and lot of it  quit an upgrad from the previous tenant  we had dinner around 715 on a tuesday and it was about 34 full  we were seat immedi and a server greet us within 3 minut  our drink came out veri quick  so far so good

aft this the wheel kind of fell off  my wife order a half pound of the steam shrimp with garlic butter  i decid i didnt want to get super messi so i got fri shrimp with french fri  ive had hot n juici fri shrimp befor and love it so i didnt think it was go to be an issu  well after about 7 minut my wife shrimp was at the tabl  i then waitedand wait  my wife was put in the posit of eat her shrimp alon or wait until my food arriv and then eat a cold dinner  dure this period while we wait the waitress basic ignor us  i think she could tell how angri i was  25 minut after my wife food arriv i spoke with a supervisor  she was nice about it apolog that they were short staf  the fri then came out after about 30 minut  my shrimp didnt come out until near 35 minut after my wife food arriv  this was approxim 4045 minut after i order  so that kind of turn us off to the whole meal  it may be that my opinion was color by the experi but i also thought the food wasnt as good as the spring mountain locat  the bread on the fri shrimp was thicker than last time i had it  the cajun fri were good howev  

they handl it well we were onli charg for the steam shrimp in the bag  the supervisor and our server were apologet but like i said the meal was pretti much ruin  i think well probabl give this locat anoth shot but so far they seem to be have some issuim be veri generous right now with a 2 star rate and this is onli becaus it was onli 10 day sinc they open this locat so im give them the benefit

ther servic was veri unorgan  it seem that the staff was run around with there head cut off 

let start with drink  they fail to refil my drink numer time  there were a few peopl respons to refil drink throughout the entir restaur and they had no clue who to service

th food  the pro tast the same as the other locat  the con they mess up my order  forgot to add my sausag and corn  in one of my bag they put the wrong spice and mix  overal i had to wait at least 15 min for them to fix the order

our waitress couldnt handl the tabl she was assign to  she was a nice ladi but she was veri fluster and couldnt handl the pressur  

this locat is veri nice compar to the rest  they invest a good amount of money to make it look that way  there were mani tvs all around so it was great to catch the game dure dinner

i will definit give them anoth shot after a month to see if they have improv there service

mi suggest  perhap they need to have all the employe play diner dash so they understand how to improv there flow lolas a big fan of pj for the past decad it pain me to say that my experi tonight at their newest locat was bad not just soso or meh but bad 

first off they had multipl tabl open but refrain from seat us becaus there were 9 of us in our parti we said we would split into two tabl but we were told even if we did that they didnt want to overload their kitchen if seat two tabl will overload the kitchen then youv got kitchen issues

second we wait over an hour for our food we watch other tabl get seat after we were receiv their food and finish befor we were serv i know they usual have their food out fast like in 5 to 10 minut so to wait over an hour was a disappoint to say the least when i did receiv my meal it tast like it had been sit under heat lamp which it like had been for a long time

i know this is a new locat but i sure hope they get their kink work out becaus this even experi wasbad

a a consol the decor is nice and the hostess were veri niceketchup wasnt a great burger joint locat in the miracl mile mall at the phthe place dont have ani waitress so you have to order at the counter the western burger was veri bland barley had ani bbq sauc in it my wife crunchi dog was the opposit it was veri salti  there chili chees fri was ok but way to much bean in the chili the onli thing good was the servic mayb caus we sat at the bar other then that there way better food in this malli realli want to like this place i love mediterranean food and i think the concept is great think chipotl meet pita but execut was serious off i went and order the build your own entre and got the falafel there were ton of choic to add on to my order and most of them were realli great but honest their falafel was ined if i hadnt order it to go i would have taken it back but instead i was stuck with falafel that could be util better by the phoenix coyot as hockey puck rather than a protein that is offer by an establish offer fresh and healthi fare needless to say i was a bit turn off by my experi and i dont think i will be back next time i need my mediterranean fix i will head to pita junglok ok oki know most peopl at least somewhat like this place but i could not find mani redeem qualiti after my visit and i love parlor the husband and i went a coupl week ago for happi hour after want to go for a long time there were onli a few peopl there when we arriv so we were seat right away i order a drink that had coconut milk amongst sever other ingredi that was recommend by our server and is no longer on their menu as i check today it took awhil to come out and when it did i was inform that it use the last of their ingredi for the drink so no chanc of get anoth one the drink was suppos to be tiki ish but it was more bitternot awesom the husband got the enabl which i actual like alright he thought it was too sweet and it had a larg amount of ice in it not a larg amount of alcohol neither were particular cheap even for happi hour i order the 5 ramen and let me tell you i would be angri if i had paid full price for it the portion was small the kale in it was veri pungent the bacon was so fatti and not render at allined the mushroom were flavorless the pork was ok the broth was noth but salti and boringi need their homemad sriracha to make it edibleit just was not good and i am a big ramen fan the husband got chicken wing and those must have been the thinnest chicken ever becaus there was bare ani meat on them at alladdit they were flavorless not spici just greasi and bland mayb it was a bad day but it was serious bad i left not want to ever come backsorri clever koiangri crab shack is pretti much a water down version of the boil crab famous in the la counti area

needless to say give this place some time  theyr still work out the kink accord to owner ron  he is a good man and i trust he will make necessari adjust to improv and bring to the valley our first cajun crawfish eateri  

here are some necessari improvementsservic isnt the best  i get it but that will come in time as manag step up the train  miss item on the menuliv in a desert i dont expect to have fresh seafood  the cajun sauc is okay at best too thick and sandyne to be broken down more so i dont get a mouth of season  more mix i guess would help  the food need to be steam longer  i ate some cold corn and some of the item in the middl were cool  grant cook but not hot enoughcrawfish bake or ani seafood at this style of cook should be steam hot and almost burn my tongu when i eat iti expect that  

the place is decor similar to the boil crab but with some extra tacki and not necessarili a good thing  it like an rc cola compar to cokejust not the same  

in the end ill wait anoth 6 month befor my return  hope youll see a better review  as for now stay tune  enjoyi have been here 2 time alreadi and here is how my  experi went
first visit when i first visit the newli open restaur it wasnt so busi becaus it was the day after thanksgiv the servic was awesom and the food was not over amaz but enough for me to come back my husband and i had order the fri calamari fri catfish pound of king crab pound of shrimp  and a pound of crawfish we want to tri as much as possibl the server recommend that we tri the trifecta flavor caus it good so we order everyth that flavor onli to find out that what she had recommend was not what she order  crawfish was order in a differ flavor which we didnt complaint about  so everyth went fine noth too big 

here come the second visit
i walk into the restaur exact 800 i had a parti of 20 so i expect to wait sinc it was busi up to ths point i was okay becaus they were busi when we final order it was 9
30 min after we order the waiter tell us no more chicken tender for the kid okay they were realli busi earlier we assum but 30 min to check and tell us whatev anoth 20 min past  i final ask after wait over 50 min by then we had finish my king crab leg where is our cod fish fri and our fri calamari then he goe into the kitchen and come back say we are out of calamari are kid me after almost and hour after we order you tell us now are you tri to make money i figur they would want to order more sinc they state in the menu 18 gratuiti for a parti of 8 or more whatev again
bi this time 34 of the restaur is empti 
even with this horribl servic we got charg gratuiti which we didnt complain about 

over all angri crab the food is good when they are not busi but the servic is horribl if you want to go eat here make sure it not at a dinner rush time and dont ever go in larg partiwhere do i even start 
i mean i wanna laugh just think about write this review

th bf and i werent hungri but decid to just tri it sinc we were alreadi at contain park 

onc we enter the place the girl at the counter told us that they were out of all the meat except the sausag linkswhich is funni becaus that the one meat i didnt wanna tri lol

regardless we went with it  sausag link sandwich and bake bean for me and mac and chees for him the girl was nice enough to give us the extra side for free

w got the sandwich first and onc we open our plate lunch we had cut up sausag link and bread 
liter 
no sandwich in sight
i look at my bf then the menu and was like i thought this was a sandwich
let it be known that the sausag link were tasty

then we get our side of bake bean and mac and chees in cup cup the kinda cup that they prolli use for their complimentari water 
the bake bean were so hot that my cup start to melt at the bottom and complet disfigur i couldnt stop laugh about it
bak bean werent anyth to rave aboutnoth sweet or caramel tast like it was from a can to be honest 
the mac and chees was penn pasta with soupi sauce

overal disappoint experi onli save grace and onli reason i didnt give it 1 star was the great servic and person of those behind the counter

 this place just open so im sure they have alot of glitch to figur out most def has a lot of potenti 


local small busi are what contain park is all about after allthe ultim meh  

you walk into this place and your struck by the decor  it a good look place  good look furnitur good look peopl good look design  then you notic there no hostess stand and what appear to be a refuge camp of peopl crowd to your left  if you push through that youll find a hostess with an ipad that will tell you itll be 90120 minut  what she wont tell you or me at least is that the tabl by the door you walk in are firstcom firstserv  

the bar area is tini for a place like this  it seat mayb 15 and youll have peopl hang over your shoulder the whole time tri to get 7 beer while they wait in the refuge camp i spoke about earlier  

onc seat you get the priviledg of wait 1520 minut to meet your waiter who in my case was a veri friend gentlemen  i think he was the highlight of the even 

as has been said in mani of these review the menu is veri narrow  we had an app 2 entre a salad and dessert  the entre were good  the gemelli with housemad bacon was veri tasti and the cod was good  not 26 good but good  the salad was liter a few leav of iceberg and a cherri tomato  we sent our app back becaus it was cold and then receiv it cold again  realli  dessert salt peanut butter bar was difficult to chew and not realli good  all in with tip for two peopl we spent 100  

i like culinari dropout sauc and blanco and id heard good thing about this place  what i experienc was that this place is new  feel cool so you want to believ it was great  but if you look past the plastic surgeri of the restaur and the audienc youll find you could have done better for your money near anywher elsim all about homemad ice cream and have been to the perfect scoop  boba tea two other locat  this particular locat warrant a total differ experi although technic the product should be the same  

one of the biggest differ is that they sell bulk item of powder mix top straw etc  it can look rather warehouselik sinc it where they keep inventori  but if your in the market then it a good thing

on our first visit the restroom was flood  sure that couldnt be help and mayb a nice sign on the door advis custom that it was out of order would have suffic  

at this particular locat you cannot look into the ice cream case like almost all ice cream store allow  therefor you are base your decis pure on what list on the menu post rather than what look visual appeal  of cours you can ask for sampl too  howev keep in mind that although it post on the menu you still have to ask if they have it  the menu doe not reflect what they current have in stock  one of the thing i enjoy from their other locat was their green tea milkshak  when i attempt to order it from here they had the green tea ice cream but they were out of soy and almond milk  so i was stuck with regular milk  this ultim meant anyon look for a vegan milkshak was out of luck  they were out of a quit of few vegan ice cream flavor too and i saw a few custom leav onc they discov this

on our second visit i attempt to call three time to ask about specif flavor befor make the drive over  no answer  were they even open  when we arriv they were open  i ask the girl work what the phone number was and she had no idea  then she told me their phone wasnt work either okay their credit card machin was down too

th restroom was work this time but there was no toilet paper paper towel or soap  not a good sign

th same girl was work and she was by herself again  when she was help my parti a guy came in and turn on the light  appar they were off  he stood by the regist and start flip through the receipt book i ask if he was the owner and he said he was the partner  there was obvious quit a few custom wait in line and one would think hed jump in and help out but this was not the case

when i ask again about soy milk or almond milk she said they were out  and so i ask about regular milk and she said they were out of that too  i had watch her make three milkshak alreadi  so what was she use  half and half  oh hmmhalf and half  at this point i had wait so long for my milkshak i just said okay  well it was a mistak  it didnt tast the same and for someon who is lactos intoler it sure affect me differ  i wont be have a milkshak made with half  half anytim soon

oth thing that could use some serious improv are how the staff are taught to rinsewash the item  for exampl the ice cream scooper and vitamix tamper stick were rins and she use her hand to rub it under the water  and watch her loos long hair hang over the deep freezer is not a good thing  rubber floor mat behind the counter are a necess especi when you can see how wet the floor is  and ultim anyon run a regist should know basic addit and subtract especi for simpl transact  on both occas we had to help her with transact becaus she enter them into the regist incorrect  i blame the manag on the poor train staff the lack of basic suppli and the lack of teamwork  we were glad to use up the last of our groupon here becaus we have no intent of come backlocat near the entranc of the downtown contain park do yourself a favor and walk around the park a littl more befor decid what your go to eat

with a name like pork  bean youd think i would get real excit you can call me an expert to pork and bean it is my favorit dish ive had them all and eat it at least onc at week van camp campbel bush heinz etc lol

kid asid yeah i dunno about this place suppos pork  bean is one of kerri simon place who i guess is a celebr chef from what i read the menu at least the menu i was present with includ item like pork and bean chili slider hot dog and few more rang from 49 noth that seem impress it was more like im not gonna pay 9 for a hotdog especi when i just saw a sign across the street at el cortez for a prime rib meal for 999  i did howev decid to tri someth went with the fanci grill chees be that it was price in the middl at 7 it was age cheddar with basil and tomato in a sourdough seem promis it had fanci in the name but when it arriv i was truli disappoint it realli was just 2 slice of bread with a veri littl chees tomato and basil the fill didnt even reach the edg of the bread and didnt even come with anyth extra like fri or pork and bean for 7 and from a chef or celebr chef i wouldv expect more fanci i littl kid couldv done better let just say i went to the nearest groceri store buy a loaf of bread some chees a bag of tomato and other item even a can of pork and bean and go have a 5 year old make someth fanci and better for about 7 i wonder what my food would have been like if i paid a dollar or 2 more

even though i didnt tri anyth els from what i saw in pictur and what came out to other i wouldnt mine give them a 1 also a 2 star might be generous i even heard tabl next to me make fun of their food they shouldv ad a side of pork and bean to each item for the same price charged

you dont have to go to pork  bean to get their food there was a waitress go around the 2nd floor tabl near boozeri seem weird sinc she gave me a drink menu from the bar downstair and a food menu from pork  bean which was all the way on the other side she brought me food so i paid heri had high hope this place would have some uniqu offer but ala i was great disappoint  my daughter got the hot dog and liter it was just a normal store size store tast hotdog on a most stale bun  the slider i order had nice bacon but the patti was the size of a fat quarter and the bun was a shrivel mass of tasteless substanc that remind me of the roll you get at the holiday inn express continent breakfast except not as good

i couldnt tell if the person take our order was rude or just didnt care becaus she show no life   

final pet peev of mine  dont tell me you are serv me ginger ale if it is coke mix with sprite from the bar  no matter what they tell you that isnt ginger alebottom line the food is averag for the vibepric point theyr go for here your better off go to lgo for a better tast option in the same genre

i order an eggbacon sandwich which was fine but averag my girlfriend salad had old avocado and was general bland and unexcit the chicken in the salad was particular dri and unappetizing

you cant spend more money on decor and establish the look of your restaur brand than you do on the foodyelp 365 challeng 2014121365 not so haute

1099th priciest dog on the menu
kob beef dog port wine onion jam truffl mayo top with foie gras torchoncold all sound pretti bangin right

wel sad to say that this wannab hot doug version sound better than it tasted
th dog itself was good but if your gonna advertis high end stuff like truffl and foie dont skimp on these thing couldnt even tast truffl in the mayo and the foie was random broken piec rather than nice medallions

th interact between the cashier and cook are just about nonexist too seem like they just go through the motion rather than engag a guest offer suggest and sell you product know whattamean

your better off hit up local spot like great link in the northwest or even fernandez on e charleston for their killer street dogsaloha

shaka meter  uuu  uuu  2i think you alreadi know the facts
tini portion overpr slow
th decor is cool and i like the linq in general but i thought it would be differ than go to casino restaur dont be fool it just like mandalay place or the forum shop if you want to walk from shop to bar to restaur east fremont is still your best betrich peopl must be so feck bore to throw money at a stunt like this  if the individu act werent so talent i would have given it one star  it felt like an episod of snls stefon list off dumb shit that eccentr millionair weirdo need to get an erect anymore

in a town where you can see a hundr varieti act on the strip this was on par with the qualiti of perform  at doubl the price tag  i love the cosmo scene i love weirdo and i haaat this show  cest la vieso we went dure someth of a transit period accord to a waiter there was suppos to be a secret entri to the studi for breakfast at piffani that you had to ask about but appar now it is someth you have to call ahead and make reserv for would have been good to know in advancewhen we ask waiter about it they told us we could go and sat us at a tabl while they sat up the room so we sat around for an hour be told that we could go which piss off the waiter whose section we were put in and then were told that now the room is reserv onli and we in fact couldnt go nobodi realli seem to know what was go on until final the manag came over to tell us that we couldnt go and we had to leav well bye

it a nice varieti show but that pretti much it it not a social experi the way it was origin tout also about 20 of the seat is terribl which is where we wound up i was behind a screen so i didnt understand half of the joke that use it couldnt appreci quit a few of the act the box offic assur us that there were no bad seat  but i can definit assur you that there are the act that i could appreci were good

complet disappoint after read all of the review was expect someth uniqu excit and fun but instead i paid 100 sat in a terribl seat and then was put at a tabl for an hour expect a midnight show which i never got to see 

dont goat least not until they get their shit figur outi went in last friday for the begin of my bachlorett parti i had just arriv in lv i love alic and wonderland i was so excit they move us to the speakeasi and it was nice and mellow super cool decor and great music there were mayb 4 other tabl 
so20 minut later we final got water and someon took our order we tri to flag peopl down numer time and didnt understand whi a redhead girl was just standi in the corner text and talk to the bartend a tabl had the chocol terrarium deliv and i didnt know what it was no one had start eat it but i saw they had fork so i ask our red head waitress if what they had was edibl or decor or what was it and she roll her eye and said no your in a restaur and you just get to look at stuff here 
i was shock im sorri i bother you i honest couldnt believ i got talk to like that voic drip with sarcasim
our food came out and basic everi other person was amaz and had such a love time but we had to ask everyon els to help us have more water more drink more napkin as she stood in the corner text with us and 1 other tabl we ad more food to our order and it took twice as long as the first time and there were less tabl so we polit ask about it we are all in the servic industri again she roll her eye and said it come and walk away i honest almost lost my shit there was 1 other tabl in there and we were all sober and so nice to her i was honest realli bum to start out my bachlorett parti get treat horribl for no reason so moral of the stori if you have the redhead waitress ask to speak to the manag or switch server i wish i diddure my littl leagu career i pick up a serious vice my easili influenc tenyearold self watch mlb player chomp on chew tobacco and follow suit by develop a habit for big leagu chew bubbl gum shred into strip in a baseballthem pouch meant to resembl their 18 counterpart it would bare last an inning and youd spend most of it spit out hotpink syrup like youd taken a big bite of flamingo you sudden regret that kinda what it like to eat at pinup pizza 

it call pinup becaus it tast like someon nail your slice to a wall for a calendar year with each top repres a feder holiday or import birthday the flavor dissip almost instant and you spend the rest of your time chew on a flavorless mass like an astronaut with a freezedri bagel paperthin minim amount of sauc and a skinni layer of chees seem limit by a dairi accountant

th price isnt right a chees slice even in new york has a ceil of 2 so whi everyon boast that the softballs garlic knot are 3 and the huge slice are onli 6 is beyond me asteroid are huge too but id rather have my dinosaur back 

the grandios natur of vega pepper the strip with celebritythem establish like gordon ramsay burgr and tila tequila stroke shack that requir long wait and littl valu it actual cheaper to buy a 64oz frozen long island complet with souvenir high roller pimp cup than a nutriti meal on the strip which is probabl whi the south side of las vega blvd is a belliger stamped of prostitut and panhandl mix with the tourist that support them be prepar to see more meat hang off the patron than the pie especi late night

pinup at least offer quick simpl and econom for vega fuel for your gambl fever plus there a certain kitschi to a larger than life meal you could wrap around your neck like a scarf everyon els should head to doityourself project pie at the mgm grand at least if your creation crash you onli have yourself to blameive been twice now and had subpar experi both time  im a huge fan of brat haus and was super excit about taco hauss grand open  we went with a group of friend on open night for taco tuesday  we arriv in time for happi hour but when we ask the server what happi hour special they offer he wasnt sure  he doubl check no problem and we order our drink  at 600 when taco tuesday offici start we ask what the tt special were  again  no clue  i look it up on fb and let him know what i found  we later saw that there was a stack of tt menus at the hostess stand but they were not share with us  again not a super big deal  i order the guacamol to start which was ok but a littl bland need more salt or someth  the salsa both green and brown were amaz  for dinner i order the scallop cevich  ive had cevich befor and did not rememb it be so raw  possibl my fault if that how it typic come and i just didnt know that  but the scallop were mushi and not at all appet so i took about a bite and left the rest  mind you im a sushi fan so raw in general is not a problem for me but the raw scallop were probabl a bad choic  i tast a friend empanada and it was quit tasti  overal i left want to give it a second chanc know it was open night and they were still probabl just work out some kinks

th second time i went for brunch  i order a bloodi mari which was amaz  honest one of the best ive had  my fiancé order a margarita  befor he could specifi which margarita there are sever on the menu the waitress had alreadi hurri off   no ask on salt or no salt either  she end up bring him the hous margarita  which was not great  my fiancé order the breakfast burrito and seem pretti happi with it  i order the cubano sandwich and was less than impress  the ham look like a slice you would get at the deli counter not the pork i was imagin for a cuban sandwich the mustard was littl overpow and was just your standard yellow mustard  i feel like i probabl could have duplic that at home  and the sandwich had no side which i was kind of hope for  we let our server know we were doneand wait  after about 20 minut of tri to track her down and have her race past us mind you it was not that busi  she final came back to our tabl  and ask if we were done  we said again that we were and wait for the bill  i forgot to mention that we had order the guacamol again as a starter  same fair bland tast but we ask for some salt and that help  then found a hair in my salsa so the rest sat unfinish  when the check final came i notic that the waitress had charg me for the guacamol  and also separ for the chip  i did not pay close attent to my bill the first visit to see if that is common but i found it weird  if guacamol is list as an appet not a side whi wouldnt it come with chip  what els would i eat it with  at this point we were readi to go so i let it be

both of these visit were in the first week of open and so i am hope that they will work out the kink quick  ill give it one more shot simpli becaus i love it sister brat haus so much and i hope they succeedhad dinner here with the famili the other nightprob will be our onli visit to this restaur the neutral to negat outweigh the positives
w start off with an order of the skillet nacho these were pretti good  no complaint the top werent overdon as you may get with other restaur nacho that drown the chip creat a mushi mess
for an entré i had the cubano torta this was good and had a nice flavor mustard the rest of the famili order a varieti of taco this is where thing start to go downhil rather than have each person taco on individu plate they were brought out on one big plate famili style and everyon had to guess and sort out which was what the feedback i got on the taco was they were oknoth spectacular we also order the streat corn to share which did have a nice flavor howev all the food came out warm at best one posit of the food is the portion size were just right 
the servic was pleasant enough and the décor was veri nice but those thing alon will not warrant anoth visit also what is with the tommi hilfig style logoname the place taco haus prepar my palett for a taco experi especi sinc it replac blue burrito  but that not what i had it almost like the chef want to be a clever alchemist but fail tom jetland he is not

i had two taco one chicken one carn asad the chicken one had no flavor except i could tast the corn tortilla the steak one tast like the steak had been marin in worcestershir sauc which was unpleas i dress them both up with guacamol and salsa i had to ask for and they were extra i hate the lunch

th place look like it would be a great happi hourinsid has picnic tabl style seat built to be line up with butt from the frat hous on saturday night there a lot of seat outsid too which would be a fun happi hour

servic was slow although there seem to be a lot of server my friend and i paid 30 for our lunch left and went to mcdonald to get ice cream cone to cleans our palett from a lunch we are tri to forget he had cevich by the way and was more than underwhelmed

i am happi to read that some of these review of taco haus are so glow mayb i caught them on an off day but somehow i dont think so i am a total foodi and this is one place i would not recommend

but what i will recommend to taco haus  write a littl blurb about your style and philosophi on the menus so custom understand theyr not get a taco that their palett might be craving

il give them two star becaus it appear they have a wide select of tequila after enough tequila anyth tast good rightmy boyfriend and i were anxious to tri bernard bistro for month hope that it could be a nice addit to our restaur rotat onc it open unfortun even after give it a second tri i cant imagin us come back ill critiqu our most recent visit base on three area servic food and atmosphere

servic the servic fluctuat between over the top and stilt to rude the manag and a server held both door open for us when we arriv which was a bit unusu given the casual atmospher i expect from a neighborhood bistro but the manag was cordial and told us we could choos a booth by the window or the wall mistaken we chose the booth by the wall appar we were sit in the section of a waiter who had no interest in serv us after walk by us repeat and ignor us for 10 minut he pull anoth employe asid and whisper in his ear point point at us as they both look straight at me and my boyfriend it was incred uncomfort after a wait of about 15 minut anoth server came to take our drink order she wasnt necessarili impolit but i think she had bigger fish to fri perhap she pull the short straw and had to wait on us we bare saw her throughout the meal although i should mention that she did help me to modifi my dish to my tast wasabi mash potato tend to be heavi on the wasabi most place which i appreciatedth onli genuin friend interact we receiv was from the busser who would chat with us when drop the bread gather plate etc the night was a mix of welcom to our finest guest and ugh i have to go talk to these peopl again 

food we had the escargot appet to start as well as the soup of the day carrot ginger i had the sear ahi tuna entre and my boyfriend had the filet medallion the escargot was good but the mushroom and tomato in the sauc were raw we order the same dish the first time we visit bernard and it was better then this is a small issu though we sop up the sauc with the bread long after the last snail had been devour the carrot ginger soup was also tasti i was worri it would be a bit thin but it had a veri nice consist the entre howev were a mess my sear ahi tuna was so chewi that i couldnt finish my meal honest i had to spit some out it was not my finest hour and my boyfriend medallion were the consist of a burger the real problem were the sauc the medallion come with a trio of sauc peppercorn brandi red wine and citrus they are all the same brown gravi sauc with addit the citrus was the most offens imagin gravi with orang drink mix in the plate and present seem outdat to me or like a plate you would be serv from a cater servic at a wed recept for exampl the dollop of mash potato is put on the plate with one of those cake nozzl the side are finickili arrang veget it like here have one steam asparagus stalk perch upon a singl zucchini coin which is set next to a curlycu lemon rind and surround by a fan of pea pod 

atmospher i think that this restaur is suffer from a confus ident we happen to eat on titan night which mean that there is a special menu option that we didnt take they play the movi titan on flat screen around the restaur and there is a pianist it a strang theme for a california french bistro you can tell that bernard like titan from the wall decor well some of them other are frenchi thing like fleurd while other are photograph of the meal it like shenanigan but despit the wall decor which is fine becaus it a bistro and need to be casual everyth els is over the top for exampl the server and busser are in finedin attir like tux shirt some custom were in short and flip flop other were busi casual it was hard to get a read on just where we were exact 

im okay with a confus ident or averag servic if the food is good and a nice enough person deliv it i dont care if you want to be a french titan bistro from california but the rude server who refus to acknowledg us and the bad entre push this restaur in the 15 star rang for methis is a new philli cheesesteak restaur in arizona mill mall it look like it replac great steak and potato which use to be one of my favorit quick servic restaur in az mill arizona mill is do a big food court overhaul and this seem to be one of mani new restaurants

i was not impress i got the buffalo chicken philli which is what i alway use to get at great steak it was extrem salti and the chicken was like deli slice instead of an actual chop up chicken breast it was drown in sauc and so salti i down two water afterward i realiz that i should not expect a ton from a quick servic restaur in the mall but great steak use to make this sandwich so well and this was no where near the same qualiti it took about ten minut to get one sandwich which wasnt too bad overal bad food i will not be backgreat locat great enough space welcom decor but

food didnt impress me
i got bunless for i had given up bread for lent i got a turkey brunch turkey burger with fri egg bacon and american chees meat wasnt dri but it wasnt moist i like my burger to where a sauc would be extra flavor this burger need sauc in my case ketchup bacon had a weird tast to it the egg wasnt to my like then again the waitresscashi didnt realli bother ask how i like my egg i had to ask for lettuc on the side when my food came instead of be on my plate alreadi becaus you order pay then sit

to also add that waitress mess up my cowork and is orders

overal the place is just ok i dont realli care for itthis place has been on my list for a few week becaus as a vegetarian i am a sucker for natur organ places

i wish i could say that i love this place i realli do i want to i tri

pros

 they have the cool drink station with ton of beverag options

cons
 the vegetarian offer are slim unless you want to eat a ton of cheesi simpl white carb as the option are either serv on white bread or are a pasta
 the food was veri oili which is not someth i expect from a place that promot healthi clean food
 they are pricey and the serv are small
 no nutrit info avail anywher i like to know how much fat sugar calori are in my meals
 the staff was not knowledg about the menu when ask question we were either told that they didnt know or they simpli read to us off the menu

i went here with tu anh and toni whove been here a few time sinc they open we got some appet i ask for oolong tea but they ran out of tea serious we were given a mix green salad with a light dress and immed toni said the salad was better when they first opened

hiromaru buns
th pork  belli was tasti it has green and kewpi japanes mayo in it i lost the pork belli somewher in the steam bun too much bun not enough meat 355

gyoza
 never been so disappoint with gyoza befor one side is suppos to be soft and the other side crisp with slight burn mark well their has burn mark around one side of each gyoza and the rest seem raw accord to cook expert toni this is due to the fact that it was cook from frozen the pork fill didnt have much tast and the dip sauc had too much soy sauc 15

kuroi tonkotsu
thin noodl in tonkotsu pork broth with mayu black garlic oil top with 3 thin slice of chashu pork hardboil egg kikurag and scallion there not enough broth 355

kaedama
toni let me tri his thick flat noodl for comparison sinc we have the same broth anyway these noodl are unnecessarili chewi it was like chew on cartilag i heardfelt a pop from my mouth  my jaw lock for a second they were softer the other time i went here 15

those red chair are so darn heavi i workout but i was not expect those sucker to be that heavi i kinda like my back and i dont want to break it the consensus inconsist how thing were cook and tast on open day is differ from 2 day ago and last night im will to give them anoth tri and hope i catch them on a good night i would have to go to carsontorr for my favorit bowl of black garlic ramen for now sighcame back to cheddar a coupl of night ago becaus i was still crave those rib that i didnt get to tri on the first visit we arriv at the restaur at 645pm i had call ahead and ask about the wait time for 2 and i was inform that the wait was about 35 minut we were okay with that when we got to the restaur the wait had increas to 45 minut which was whatev i understand that they are busi and they are the new kid on the block right away we after sit in the wait area we wit a rather unpleas scene unfold a veri unhappi gentleman was at the hostess stand yell that he had been wait for 2 hour now this is rather ridicul and if he and his parti had been wait that long they should have approach the stand earlier or just left there is no need to wait that long to be seat in a restaur i guarante the food here is not worth a 2 hour wait they gm came over to the stand and told the man that they would get him seat immedi he did follow the gm to the tabl but he was clear veri angri after that we wit about 3 other guest come up to the stand and say they had been wait well over 45 minut they were all seat right away the manag came back to the hostess stand and yell at all of the girl 3 of them work on the seat chart it was veri unprofession and he should have done this at a differ time in a differ set clear all they need at that point was help poor manag this whole seat debacl seem to set everyth back and we didnt end up be seat until 745pm 

onc seat we were greet quick by our waitress she was nice and got us water right away unfortun after she got us water we onli saw her about onc everi 1520 minut first my fianc order a starter salad we receiv this about 20 minut after be seat we usual share the salad so we ask for an addit plate never got it it had hard ani ranch on it so we ask for an extra side of ranch we never got it we order our entre when our salad came out i order the rib with mac and chees and cole slaw my fianc order the chicken finger 5050 with half buffalo and half origin and fri it took anoth 30 minut for the food to arriv we saw mani other tabl around us who had been seat after us receiv their food befor we did i do have to say that the rib were good not the best i have ever had but they were tasti the mac and chees was realli good the problem was with my fianc meal first of all the half buffalo half origin was a joke i thought base on pictur that had been post that the buffalo strip came out similar to a buffalo wing wrong instead they just shook some buffalo sauc over the top of the strip which coat part of all of the chicken strip make them all buffalo not 5050 it also made them extrem soggi and the bread just fell apart not veri appet when the chicken strip came out he had ask for barbecu sauc right away we wait and wait and never saw our waitress no barbecu sauc to be found sometim you realli need a sauc to be abl to eat a meal this was one of those case my fianc never receiv his sauc and was veri unhappi about the entir meal servic was horribl it was non exist realli i can onli imagin that base on the way that the gm was talk to the hostess staff that it also carri over to the wait staff which in turn im sure make for a veri stress environ especi for new staff it was 915pm when we left the restaurant

overal my assess is that cheddar has a long way to go to becom a smooth run restaur they need to work out some kink in both custom servic and the kitchen in order to improv the experi for their guest they just simpli dont know how to handl how busi the restaur current is and this is not make a good impress for a new restaur it will be a long time befor i visit cheddar again the food is pretti good but not worth an hour wait and poor custom servicmayb i jump the gun by suggest to have brunch here last sunday i usual wait for a new restaur to be open a few month befor tri it but i sometim make an except if there are rave review in this rare occas yelp had fail me

mi husband and i had met my friend here and we share 3 differ plate it wasnt note that this was tapa style on the menu at all nor was it suggest how to order so we thought 3 dish for 3 peopl would be enough food for drink my husband had a sleepi dog hefeweizen my friend a cocktail and i order a mimosa which was a pretti good deal at 5 my husband and friend drink came out immedi while i was told they were wait for a bottl of champagn to open about 10 minut later i receiv my drink 

two of our order arriv first the tuna poke and the lamb kimchi fri rice our server then came over  told us that their comput had gone down and due to the error he gave us a complimentari pig ear pad thai we said thank you as it alway nice to have that type of error work in your favor he put the plate down on the tabl and as we were about to dig in anoth staff member walk up to our tabl and took the pig ear plate away without say a wordawkward the server apolog for the mistak as it must have been a misunderstand we start our meal and then the staff member came back a few minut later and put the pig ear plate back on our tabl again without say a word we were somewhat apprehens of eat it a this point was it go to be taken away again anyway beggar cant be chooser i was veri appreci of the complimentari entre but the awkward that came with it realli wasnt worth it

a for the food the tuna poke was fresh tast but flavor wise it was noth realli special the lamb kimchi fri rice tast good but was greasi and had the teeniest tiniest piec of lamb in it our third order was the poutin this was the best thing we had it had a flavor cream sauc chunk of lamb and a runni egg the pig ear pad thai was pretti good too nice  crispi and came with pickl veggi 

so whi two star the portion size were laughabl each entre was about 5 bite max we werent inform that one dish per person isnt even close to enough food we end up have an extra dish due to the snafu but we still all left hungri it would be one thing if the food was amaz then i would want to order more dish but noth was veri memor or fantast enough the price point did not match the portion at all the servic was also lack the server took our credit card to run it and then wait a good 20 minut to receiv it back after have to ask for it sorri but i cant see myself returnthis place is locat on the second floor of the mall that connect the palazzo and the venetian ok serious this is the most overr and overpr dessert hous i have ever been to ok it the strip i should have been more awarebut when you order 6 pastri and it come to 68 dollar it better be the best fing pastri you have ever tast tast was averag at best but the box and string were first ratei suspect that what i was pay for just anoth exampl of an all hype out fanci schmanci underwhelm and thorough disappoint experi on the strip whi is it that all these place on the strip put so much into the visual experi and short peopl on the tats experiencethes are place to eat not place to look at viewssmheveryon come here becaus it cake boss im sorri to say that my friend and i were part of those who got sucker into come here

th shop is small and understaf grab a number to order 30 minut wait we couldnt even see what there to order sinc the shop was like pack sardin with peopl push up against the display 

final it was our turn the staff took down our order then more wait order had to be pack and place in queue at the oneperson regist then more wait for our name to be call so we can pay

w spent 60 minut to get our order verdict not worth it the pastri were ordinari if not subpar for the wait and price again not worth iti want to updat my review becaus the manag messag me on yelp invit me back to the restaur i appreci the fact that they are concern with their custom feedback hope they will use the custom feedback and implement the necessari chang that should be made they could start with either lower their menu price or purchas higher qualiti product i dont mind pay top dollar for top qualiti but that is not what is offer here i am not look for a free meal i just give honest feedback to inform other consum so i want to be clear about whi i gave them two star on my review

i would give them five star if the review was just base on their staff the servic was excel the staff is veri friend and attent to the custom as demonstr by the manag show concern about my review the kitchen staff did a fine job on the prepar and the present of the food i was disappoint with the qualiti of the product use in the perpetr the prime rib in the sandwich and the meat in the burger were not up to par the chicken wing were averag at best and extrem over price for what you are serv person i dont care for some of the flavor combin on the menu

i want to be veri clear about the fact that the kitchen staff cook the food proper and present it as they were suppos to it was the qualiti of the product i gave two stat to not the servic or the preparation

i think my expect of the food befor i arriv led me to be so disappoint with the food it is just averag food though it was not a bad meal and none of the food tast bad if the price were not so high i may have given them three stat it is just not worth the money the burger are definit not up to par with the like of lbs bacchi burger and gordon ramsay burger i would even say smash burger and fat burger serv better tast burgers

to be fair i will conclud by suggest that you give them a tri and make your own decis on the qualiti and tast of the menu itemguy fieri isnt exact the most refin of the food network lineup of star but you would at least expect someth decent if it has the dude name attach to it i mean i have yet to be disappoint by ani of the restaur featur on diner drivein  dive that ive visited

wel so much for his namesak restaur price are in line with similar vega restaur that said for the amount of money your drop and the fact that the place carri a food celebr endors youd expect a lot better qualiti food

had the bacon mac  chees burger and it a fantast burger in theori execut howev left a crapton to be desir the burger was dri not moist  juici and clear flattop fri and not grill then they serv it to you on this narrow wooden plank which certain look cool but when it a big messi burger the serv plate was utter useless the fri goodi it came with were also serv in an odd manner  wrap in wax paper and suspend from an aluminumwir thing super messi  all form no function

port were no surpris massiv but when you consid the food was mediocr it was just a plate full of blah ignor the guy fieri hype no need to bother with this placelunch  2100  person  dinner  2600  person for ayce

ric rice rice and a brick of rice in my belli this place realli know how to give the illus of a good fish to rice ratio by give lengthi fish slice but underneath you meet your doom of impend rice they compact the rice so it was thick like a rock

th menu select is not great for ayc you have mani limit on what and where you can order from no sashimi no soft shell crab onli in roll no half roll all the roll are larg standard size most 8 piec with the except of some that are 5 piec still the same larg size as the 8 piec just cut differ not a great place if you want to tri a bunch of differ roll even the nigiri select was limit and overal pretti unimpressive

dont even think about order the ahi poke seafood salad salmon skin salad or ani of their salad for that matter they were crazi weak in flavor fish execut i wasnt happi with them at all 

the onli redeem dish were
1 dynamit appet 
2 salmon belli nigiri
3 bake mussel 
4 green tea creme brûlée
and that it

th servic we receiv was below averag they werent even busi there were 2 other tabl dine besid us we had to ask multipl time to differ server to grab us wasabi and hot sauc our waitress was miss most of our dinner

in the end we left feel uncomfort stuf due to the dens rice expand to top it off it was hot and stuffi in there and the music made my ear bleed i agre the interior design was new modern beauti and spacious but the overal night club vibe of the restaur was high disconcert 

in a citi that love a good ayc sushi joint this is not the place to go i would recommend anoth korean ran spot that doe a better job sakana 

now with a belli bust from rice i bid you good luck and good evenlove the food hate the service

today was my second time come here the first time was over the weekend at night and it was bad  order were mess up left and right  i was die to give it a second chanc  

the shrimp came in a time manner along with the rice   i went for the rice and it was hard like uncook  im usual understand but anyon scoop that rice from the cooker to the contain mustv struggl enough to realiz this should not have been serv  i call the server over and they took it back  she came back and said that someth was wrong with the rice cooker and that it may take 15 minut for the next batch to come out  i didnt realli have a choice

then some ladi came and offer us hawaiian roll  keep in mind that while wait for that we did not touch the shrimp  were asian so rice is realli import lol  15 minut pass  no rice and no roll  i was start to get irrit and i was hungri so we just ate again without ani of what was promised

what youll notic about the servers
1 they hover by the kitchen tri to avoid or delay the bad news they have to deliver

2 theyll ask how your do but veri few genuin care

3 theyll say theyll check on it and will onli rememb to tell you their find when you call them over again  arent you suppos to return from your mission  lol

th roll final came  onli three by the way for two peopl which was suppos to make up for the uncook rice we both bit into  and have been miss sinc this was on the hous so that was generous sarcasm  rice was 199 each and we order two  that 4  roll are 175 for three  whatev  they were just like the kind you buy at the store except warm up  i dont know whi it took that long

bi the time we were told the rice was on it way we alreadi finish the shrimp  so the rice would have been useless

imo  food is good  custom servic sucka new addit to my favorit area of las vega after brunch we stop here  for some treat to take home 
the place is small upon enter there were peopl congreg around the counter so i wasnt sure where the line began or end we made our way to the display case when it becam visibl and got in line there is an open view of the kitchen where you see the dough be made and hand roll and cut  the woman behind the counter kind describ each avail doughnut to everyon order i tri the key lime pie the root beer the mexican chocol with horchata fill nutella with hazelnut on top
h doughnut itself seem oilygreasi in tast mayb the oil wasnt hot enough when the batch was fri this was a let down sinc it was consist in each one all the fill and top were good not over sweet the nutella doughnut tast more like choral and not the nutella tast that i love 
the staff was wri friend and attentivethey were prepar coffe while you were wait in the doughnut line to keep a flow go it is a new place and will tri them again i hope it was just an off dayum the doughnut were oili and greasi i didnt like it

im not write this to dis a local busi but to encourag improv the trend is more and more toward healthi food  you cant deni or fight them  like it or not

luddit movement wont have a chanc internet is not a seri of tube healthi food trend are not an elit  everi cultur matur develop countri has it and it will never reverse

i thought o face doughnut got a potenti  just do more research and offer someth bettereveryth is awesom except the food

interest menu nice staff fun concept but asid from the beignetswhich are onli passabl as someth other than beignet  the food is somewher between subpar and plain ol terrible

ord a burrito a quesadilla some nachotot and the beignet so felt like we tri it all  there were 2 issu with everi singl thing we ordered

1 the ingredi werent veri good kinda like someon empti out microwav burrito instead of make rice meat veggi etc

2 the food is poor prepar  the kid that work there are veri nice but they put so much buffalo sauc on the quesadilla that it was ined and the burrito was layer like a parfait so that each bite was a singl but differ ingredient

might tri again some day but doubt itthe newli open martinez taco bar is a famili run joint locat in the aliant area just east of the 215 insid the restaur youll find a hand of tabl a coupl booth and the counter with built in salsa bar and a somewhat open kitchen behind it for as big as this locat is the dine area is fair small but luckili addit seat can be found outside

alongsid tradit item like taco and burrito mtb is also serv up some surf n turf option signatur taco and even burrito bowl price is similar to other taco joint with taco ring in at 2 vampiro at 4 and burrito at 7 it appear that they run special or plan to at some time as there was a white board in the window with price that didnt match either the menu or their hand written chalkboard sign insid 

of cours i had to tri their al pastor for whatev reason the spit wasnt go and i assum they precut the meat if you prefer nice thin slice of al pastor you wont find it here the meat cut chunki and it also pretti crispi almost to the point of be burnt flavor was okay but noth great and becaus it was overcook it was a bit dri 

in hope to sampl some other meat they offer i order a pollo asado and carn asada taco as well they must have mix up my order becaus i onli end up with 2 al pastor and 2 carn asada taco no biggi but a bit disappoint thank the carn asada was much better than the al pastor and although it was also cut realli thick it remain tender and juici the flavor was great and didnt need ani sauc to be enjoyed

a big part of the problem asid from the meat is the proport of the taco one of them onli had 1 tortilla and the other had 2 but they were realli dri top wise there was a huge amount of salsa and veri littl onion or cilantro i had ask for pineappl on my al pastor taco which they confirm twice but ultim forgot to add while the sauc is decent and has a good bite they put on way too much and it overpow everyth els it also much hotter then i expect and even though i love hot food it was too hot for my son and he couldnt even finish eating

mtb is not a full servic restaur and even though the counter servic was great they were understaf and overwhelm unfortun it show they onli had one cook work at the time and even though they werent super busi it did take quit a while to get our food and not onli did they mess up our order but sever other guest around us had error in their 

some simpl plan and a coupl extra hand would most like make a huge differ in qualiti here i do think they have potenti and becaus of that ill come back in a month or so when they hope got the kink work out but for now unfortun my dream of get a good taco spot in our neck of the wood have been crush againi love taco     

just not these 

i was look forward to delici taco on cinco de mayo but sad i cannot claim this my favorit taco joint noth scream delici at me and if i wouldnt have been starv i might not have finish my vampiro the salsa they includ on it was so extrem spici i had to chug the dr pepper we were share our poor son was still hungri after leav becaus he couldnt finish his taco due to the heat our mouth were on fire the boyfriend didnt mind it too much but hes alway had a thing for spici 

the meat had flavor just no moistur the taco fill ratio was off  not enough meat to top they mess up our order in a few way which is understand sinc it was busi and there was onli one cook im assum it was the husband 

it a great locat and a nice atmospher on the insid but i dont think ill be back not unless the boyfriend want to tri it again later down the road i wont be go out of my way thoughmy parti of 4 were extrem excit to visit giada on their 4th day open  giada was present and make the roundscool  while we wait for our tabl we start with a bit of coppa bacon wrap date and char octopus  all delici item  drink were imagin tasti and stiff 

onc we were seat at the tabl it went south  we order 3 pasta dish 2 main  a side and a bottl of wine  the sommeli was awesom and choos a great burgundi but the foodit just never came 30 min into the bottl of wine the server check and said there was problem and it would be out shortlyanoth 20 min and a second bottl wineno food  

final after an hour  a chicken make an appear no pasta yet with a bit of flourish disappear for carv and doesnt come back  it like they were teas us  well we wait for anoth 10 min but unfortun we had a show to catch at 10pm and after 2 12 hour at giada we onli had appsalcohol to fill our belli  the manag was gracious and compd our 2 bottl of wine and app but couldnt make right our disappoint or rumbl stomach dure the show  

hope this was just open jitter as it was the first friday night they were serv dinner  realli wish i could of tri more of their foodi will have to agre with sasha review it a new concept new restaur open but they need to fix some of the flaw that sasha and i experienc befor i provid my experi i will say cool concept definit remind me of when i was in china thailand and philippin go to their night market the hot in there definit remind me of my visit to asia  i wish it was a littl cooler especi in the summer  i enjoy the differ asian cuisin in one place from what i could see the cuisin repres were vietnames chines and japanes and fuku burger which is one of my favorit food truck in town  i thought overal there would be more option and the food qualiti in the window would look better even panda express food look like the fresh and qualiti is better

i would have to agre that buy food from differ place were annoy  what was more annoy is ask for someth and the worker at the front had no idea what i was talk about  i want the summer roll in which the cashier gave me but then i said where is the peanut sauc he repli we dont have that i said um it right there in your display and who would serv summer roll without peanut sauc he look confus i point to the display and he said oh let me ask you need to hire peopl that are knowledg in the cuisin  we paid for our 2 choic plate after we order from the chines panda express look station we went to the next station to order the bento look set to includ bbq pork and duck i didnt think it was worth 16 and veri true about the duck i took a bite and it was bone yuck it wasnt even good after i had to wait 15 minut for my food  the food took forev to come out and there wasnt that mani peopl in line possibl kitchen still learn the process we paid at anoth station for the plate  now off to fuku burger to get our tamago burger and fri with crack sauc and side mac salad  this is the onli place that know what they are do flawless servic and good food now we want boba and beer and we are off to the next station i have never wait for boba for 20 minut  whi did it take so long they made order for peopl behind me and forgot my boba by the end i was annoy 

if i have to spend that much money on fast food i would rather eat at brooklyn bowl or chayo  i spent just as much at those restaur and the qualiti is better  i may give them a coupl more month to see if they fix new restaur open flaw first easi fix start with hire peopl who are serv the food and cashier know what they are servim not sure what they were think when they thought of this place it sound good at first asian street food like a night market with entertain the latter they got down the night market part absolut not i just got back from taiwan and understand the charm of an asian night market it cheap novel in content and divers these factor simpli do not exist here pointless
