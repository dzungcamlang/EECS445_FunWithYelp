the decis you have to make about a wed cake are both surpris numer and surpris complex with certain option you choos earli on have a vast impact on the design option you have later for exampl if you choos buttercream for your frost it will be smooth and sweet and creami awesom in your mouth  but on the cake ani color will run and it cant hold complex shape so your limit yourself to veri simpl design other frost option exist such as fondant and roll white chocol and they each have their own set of benefit and limit as well

if your good at research you have some time to kill and you know what your look for you can find a lot of this inform onlin  but when your in the midst of the overwhelm task of plan a wed it would be so so much easier to just sit down with a profession who can lay out all your option and explain the benefit and limit of each one

unfortun you wont find anyon like that at carl cake oh carl seem friend help and optimist when you first meet him the sampl he gave us at our cake tast were better than i ever knew cake could be and when we ask about decor he was quick to assur us that he could do anyth you want 

after our initi meet with carl we surf the net for exampl of memor wed cake and cherrypick the idea we like best until we had put togeth the perfect cake design ill admit it was on the moder complic side but noth except by wed cake standard and after carl repeat assur at the tast that he could do anyth you want we thought we were safe

but onc he has your deposit his attitud chang hes difficult to get ahold of by phone and imposs to get ahold of by email sudden ani design request more complic than the averag birthday cake are answer with a simpl i cant do that even someth as simpl as multipl color will be refus on the basi that the color will bleed togeth he never tri to suggest compromis or altern and if you ask for them hell onli tell you to come in and pick someth from his generic book of designs

whi all the limit becaus carl frost his cake with buttercream frost  and onli buttercream frosting

 lost track of how mani hour we spent on the phone go back and forth with carl over the cake design struggl to find someth he could do that didnt leav us cold deal with him wast a larg portion of the limit time we had to plan our wed and drastic increas our stress dure an alreadi stress time if i was rate his busi pure on custom servic id have to give him 1 star

but ill also give credit where credit is due in the end he deliv our cake on time in the flavor size and design that we eventu agre to it was beauti if vast simplifi from our origin design and the flavor to this day our wed cake is still the best thing ive ever had in my mouth if i were rate his busi pure on tast id have to give him 5 star heck id give him 6 if it were possible

so if you want the best cake youv ever had in your entir life consid carl cake  but consid veri care give him an exact cake design and make absolut sure he can do it without modif befor you give him a dimethe other day my cowork and i decid to go to canyon cafe  also this restaur use to be call sam cafe    they chang name back in februari  

so we got our drink and we order the queso dip to start our meal off and then we order our food   then the queso dip came out  it was realli good but it was also a littl runni  

now for our food when they were hand us the food  the ladi was pass the fajita across me to my cowork and the juic from the fajita spill all over me and my meal  luckili i had my napkin in my lap but it still got on my jean  you would think that a manag would come over and apolog for what happen or at least comp my food  instead they told me that they would pay for my dri clean bill if i want to get my jean dri clean    

other than the spill the meal was great i order the basin meatloaf i total recommend the meatloaf  it was one the best meatloaf i have had in a long time  last but not least our waiter was realli nice and did a great job take care of usdoe authent mean good

not necessarili 

i suppos the comedor is more authent than a place like macayo or garcia becaus they offer such typic mexican delicaci as tripa and cabeza they also have a menu full of the fish and marisco that anglo tend not to order in typic gringomex outlet they also dont drown their entre under an avalanch of yellow cheddar cheese

but as an experi i would say even if it doe offer a greater select of authent menu item it not realli that much more satisfi than the other place 

i had the carn asada taco which were servic if not thrill the dish came out warm and didnt have the telltal sign of have sat under the salamand for longer than it should at one time these taco would have been a revel to anyon wean on the lawri hardshel one now with their soft grill dual corn tortilla good wrap them they resembl ani number of other street taco that have becom more and more popular recently

th atmospher is    well   comedor mean dine room in spanish that what it is a big room full of tabl mariachi were a nice touch

w wait 30 minut at lunchtim on a saturday to get a tabl mayb that whi i am less than thrill  the place doesnt want for popular asid from the wait i had no complaint with the service

so to the uniniti i would go with an open mind not expect a lifechang experi i would also advis peopl to tri the thing like the lengua molcajet a sort of tongu stew serv in a lava bowl the avail of stuff like that is what realli set comedor apart

and keep in mind that authent doesnt alway mean goodcame here for dinner with scott after a wonder basebal game  it right around the corner from chase field and neither of us had been here befor  we had an excel time togeth at coach and willi but i think we both left with a feel of someth to be desir by this place  here my take on the place

i dont think this place is bad  i just think it not the greatest  scott and i did enjoy our time here but i think we both found the same thing annoy about it

first i feel like there a conflict of decor  i feel like there two complet differ theme go on here and they both clash with one anoth  part of it seem like it want to be a nicer resturantth other part want to be a sport bar  neither one compliment each other  

when you walk in there a great patio area for dine  love it  but then when you walk in and kind of walk around it show sign of tri to be a sport bar  the bar itself is set realli low  lower then the tabl themselv  heavi marbl look bar top with chair  

at one point scott and i count 15 yes 15 flat screen tvs  i will say there was one particular tv in our area that i notic that had amaz recept  it was probabl one of the better flat screen i have seen  

to my benefit i order the half nacho  the server end up bring me out a full plate of nacho bonus and i was happi  food here is so so  

i feel like this place is a place i would probabl bring my parent to but it realli didnt blow me awaythere is no such thing as a wonder basebal game when our arizona diamondback lose  but it was fun to visit the ballpark and we did have a good time

within walk distanc so i didnt have to move my truck this place seem to have the greatest appeal base on reviews

mi impress was of a restaur that happen to have what look like a veri uncomfort low bar and a nice outsid patio  and also a whole bunch of tvs  the sort of place dad could take the whole famili for dinner and posit himself to see the game he would rather have stay home and watch  but it in the wrong neighborhood for that  i onli saw one coupl on the patio as it was a bit chilli  there may have been heater but i didnt notic them

th food certain was not excit  i had a filet mignon sandwich 1400 and chose fri over the salad on the recommend of our server  fri were soggi and limp  he must never have tri them  ami b had 12 order of nacho wbeef 650 and they gave her a full order at the 12 order price rather than make her wait for the correct order to be made  the food was edibl but neither of us felt motiv to continu past the no longer hungri point  and neither of us were encourag the other to tri what we were eat 

we got start off a bit on the wrong foot as the sign said wait to be seat which we start to do  the hostess was also the waitress for the front of the hous and told us to grab seat at the bar and i said we want a tabl and stood there as she wander off to check the id of some folk that had just order at a tabl cute young women should know they are go to get card and not have their id buri at the bottom of a 15lb piec of luggag they call a purs  the waitresshostess did final look up and realiz we were not move and told us to grab a tabl and someon would find us  it took rough 10 minut for our server to show the first time but after that he was there just as much as need  dure that time i notic fat tire was on tap so i order the 20oz glass 700  ami had a diet cola which was refil twice just as she empti it  consid we arriv with the after game crowd i think we got realli good servic and i would say at it peak the restaur insid was about 23 full and dwindl as we were there

overal it is not a bad place and i would go again if invit but i want to tri some other place in the area too on my infrequ trip downtowni came here for lunch yesterday with my mama this place is tini but it definit has charact there were 2 peopl sit outsid  3 peopl insid so they werent exact busi we sat close to the bar  listen to a coupl guy play guitar  a woman sang a coupl song my mom put 5 in their tip jar  one of the guy came over to give us a flyer  chat he was so sweet for our meal mama order the panini italiano  i order the pesto chicken sandwich for side she chose the hous salad  i chose the potato salad mom enjoy her meal as did i but i had to salt the potato salad  even that didnt helpit was pretti blah i took half of mine  half of my mama sandwich home for hubbi he like both but said mom was better total for both meal includ drink was 22 one thing that was a lil annoy was how slow the servic was our server was veri nice but it took 30 minut just to get our food which seem way too long for a place that onli had 7 custom total it was pretti good food though so id probabl returnthe old spaghetti factori is by far my guiltiest pleasur let face it the food isnt that great and on more then 5 occas i have been here and it seem like the entir buss staff was on a smoke break

grow up in the willo district as a child my mother took me to the spaghetti factori alot i rememb sit in the trolli and the entir 8688 sun team was in the build help out sign autograph and what not sure was fun as a kid

now that im older i just have those memori to make me say this place isnt all bad 

the mizthra chees and butter on some noodl is still delish the meat sauc is decent to great the pesto ranch dress is pretti goodto bad the lettuc is either still soak wet or dri and disgust 

as a phoenix institut for decad i wish this place was better mayb someday someon will come in and turn it aroundbut as a chain restuar i dont see that happen either wayfor nostalgia ill still eat here on a quirki whim but i will not go out of my way to eat herei had busi downtown this morn so i stop in here for lunch right around the corner  i use to go to osf in newport beach ca way back in the 70s  i was somewhat amaz that they are still around  that there one in phoenix

step insid this is the most junkedup restaur ive ever been to  ok except mayb bahooka rib  grog  it a big place with soft light insid  room all over the place stuf with ton of furnitur barrel  so on clutter up everi one of them  it all on purpos of cours  my booth in the midst of all this crazi was actual complet ok  the floor elev is up  down all over the place too 

ok so for my first time in about 35 year i just order the pasta classic  rich meat sauc which is their way of say spaghetti

som good things

  i start with a cup of coffe  it was excellent

  pretti soon came a mix lettuc salad which was simpl but the ranch dress was realli tasty

  the next thing to hit the tabl was a littl loaf about three by eight inch of hot sourdough bread with a cup of whip garlic butter all on a breadboard with a suitabl knife for cut it  it was great

a coupl of less wonder things

  some girl from the kitchen brought my spaghetti befor i was finish with my salad

  i thought the spaghetti sauc was ok but not great

bottom line  they give you plenti to eat here  my meal includ the beverag salad or soup the hot bread entre  dessert  it was nice  fill  a good valu at 999 for everyth    

  rosemead ca  former also west covinastop in for brunch on saturday with my mum aunti and grandma
no complaint realli it a decent place the lasagna and chicken marsala werent bad my favorit was probabl the minnestron howev i wish id just gotten a huge ass bowl of that i think my favorit aspect of this place is the retro furnitur realli big chair cover infelt i guess whatev theyr color and funki there an old trolley car insid the build overal this is a good famili style restaur and appar it been there for age id go back but probabl onli with the famz and probabl onli to tri their pasta w mizithra chees and brown butter definit aoki have eaten here on sever occas for lunch and i have mix review about the place  it not horribl but it not the greatest either

for starter they are tuck away in a realli weird spot  it in the asu center and if you did not know it was there i realli dont know how you would find it  it also a rather small locat so there is actual no seat insid the place  all you can realli do is place an order and take it to go

th few time i have been in there the servic has been pleasant but not great  there is a guy who has wait on me befor and i believ he is either the owner or a manag  hes friend and nice but alway involv in a convers with someon els  it seem like the peopl that he was talk to were his friend and i had to wait for him to finish talk to them befor i could get ani servic  plus it not like hes neccesarili wait on them  hes shoot the breez so to say  can you say annoy  im on lunch hour here peopl i dont have time to play game  i just want to eat my lunch and be done with it ya know

anyway they seem to have a decent menu of item but the price are ridicul expens  i cant believ how much this guy charg for his sandwich  like 7 for a cheapo sandwich  the food is good and the portion are good but i just find that it not worth the 710 at allplus you have no seat and you ignor me when i come in  yyyeeeaaathree star becaus the menus hit or miss i dream about the grill feta sandwich toast just right soft and chewi so tasti but i gag on the pimento chees sandwich couldnt even finish it tri give it to the dog when i got home but she didnt want it either and shell eat anyth one time she ate a whole tube of neosporin neosporin what a freak love the pasta salad but cant stand the potato salad i keep go back i just get the same thing everi time almost took off anoth star becaus one time some chicken somehow end up in my grill feta sandwich i dont eat chicken which i didnt discov until i was chew yuck took me a long time to forgiv but i final did havent forgotten though  i still peek insid befor take each biteas i left the heard museum park lot and head north on central i thought i might stop at fez and tri their feb pasta special  what i realli want to do was to head over to rose and crown to meet with new acquaint but i didnt want to worri about park  on the way i spot hbb on the left but i kept go north for fez  howev it seem like id never get there so i gave myself a stop point if i hadnt reach fez by the next light i was go to turn around and interrog the poor soul that happen to greet me at honey bear  

the poor soul name was rich who inform me that hbb onli has one sauc and unfortun for me it contain   i receiv the same respons at the glendal chocol affair but i assum the one sauc onli was for conveni purpos  see  never assum  he sold me on the fact that they marin the meat in a spice and vinegarbas marinad  alright ill tri a 12 pound about 8 w tax of pork his fave and beef which the young man who patient wait behind me while i ask poor rich so mani question order after i step asid and consid my option  no wait ill have a full pound about 15 w tax and could you add chicken too  and bbq sauc on the side pleas 

while i wait for my takeout order i ask rich if i could sampl the sweet potato pie and to my surpris he hand me a slice told me to grab a spoon and help myself  it took onli one teaspoon of that slice for me to decid on purchas a whole pie 12 to go  

so how did the meat tast wo the bbq sauc  the chicken was veri bland and pretti dri  the beef was not much better but at least it had some mouthfeel  the pork was the clear winner esp sinc it marinad had the ad benefit of red pepper flake  would i go back for more meat  unless hbb design a non basedsauc no  well mayb for the pork  and onli if i was carri a bottl of bbq sauc in my purse

1 star each for the pull pork sweet potato pie and for rich be such a sport  kudo for let me sampl the pie  let peopl sampl is alway good for busi  

ps  if hb had a shack that onli sold sweet potato pie id give it 5 stars
pp  honey bear bbq pleas add candi yamssweet potato to your menu  while your at it add some sweet potato fri as well

allergi updat i conclud that the sweet potato pie must contain  ingredi bec i went through two day of horribl allergi symptom  i wont be abl to enjoy it anymor but for those wout allergi do give it a tritri a mac n chees flight this past tuesday 421  one serv cost 8 or a trio 10  i chose blue chees pancetta and caramel red onion and butternut squash  i favor the blue chees for huge flavor and the pancetta and onion for love textur  the butternut was alright mild sweet and i did like it for nibbl  at the veri least it was my veggi portion of the meal  i thought the present couldv been better i can appreci the rustic look one realli cannot control how the chees will boil and spew in the oven well have a look at the photo and tell me what you think  i did wit anoth tabl receiv a betterlook trio of ramekin of what i dont know so perhap she chose a differ set from what id ordered

lov the section of lemon tart i had for dessert  awesom butteri shortbread with a well of lemon curd then top with a fresh lemon slice  i did notic that my tart slice was crack in a coupl of place  thought it clever of the server to hand the dish to me with the lemon slice neat cover up the defect  still a greattast dessert though it a musttri if you like lemon or butteri shortbread

httpwwwyelpcombizphotoshu6sn5r6vayqmrmgvpgoqselecty6gf0oms3bwu8vjc7kymsgthis is a lunch review so pleas know that i wasnt drink wine at the time my review may have come out differ if wine was on board  

i thought the place was nice enough but for some reason i was expect nicer the decor was just mehfor me 

the price seem unbalanc we got the 3 chees plate as an appet and it was good but again i was expect a littl more for 1600 i order the lunch combo half sandwich and soup for 1000 the chicken and prosciutto sandwich was a bit dri and sort of lifeless but the tomato basil soup with goat chees chunk stir throughout was amaz i would go back and just have that soup 

all in all a nice lunch but im not in a huge rush to go back mayb for drink and an appet befor dinner someplac els also we felt it was a bit odd that everytim our femal server she never divulg her name came to our tabl she address us as ladi and gentleman at least tell me your name befor you call me that for an hour i realli want to love cheuvront it close to work and i like the atmospher here i also realli like the choic of wine they offer and they alway have great wine tast event go on  i just get the vibe that everyon take themself way too serious it noth that is blatant becaus the servic is effici and friend enough but it just a feel that i get perhap a slight upturn of the nose or that the custom should be thank that they get to be here

im alway preoccupi with attitud so mayb it just me but i alway have that am i welcom here kind of feel when i come here of cours if im spend  here than the answer is obvious yesstillhav to have more of a think on this

bi all mean worth check out youll probabl feel a differ vibe than mejust like it namesak this spot is loud wild and crazi if you come here befor or after a sport event it sure to be jam pack from floor to ceil ive seen everi type of person here from the out of towner older gentlemen entertain  younger ladi to famili take down the super gigant hot dog that adam richmond domin on man vs food to colleg student drink the entir bar up befor the game it a fun atmospher the food is generic bar food with the except of some ginorm food option and overal just an excit and enthusiast crowd and seen this is definit a spot to keep on the list if your in downtown look for a fun spot to stop into befor or after a gameim a huge fan of greek food  ive been to athen and i love it there  and believ it or not i like express aka fast casual restaur where you order at the counter and they bring your food to the table

so when i found myself downtown and hungri for lunch head over to athenian express was a nobrain  i cant say that ill be rush back but it was fine it deliv on what i was in the mood for on that day

lunch price is super afford and portion are larg  the greek salad was noth special  ive definit had better but ive had wors too 

one key thing to note i do not recommend ad chicken to your salad  it not the greatest qualiti chicken  if you do go here stick with the vegetarian optioni dont know about this place  they have all these great wrap sandwich but the salad seem like an afterthought  and i tri to avoid food carb caus i need them carb for drink  so i got the greek salad and it just seem plain to me  i love all the kalamata oliv and abund of feta but flavor seem to be lack  mayb ill have to get a wrap next timei have been here 3 time 2 time to eat and onc i forgot cash the first time was not great the fryer was down and the frys suck 

the 2nd time was a littl better except the food inspector was there normal this is a nonissu but in a diner car that serv 9 you hear and see everyth 

we order 2 doubl and 1 fri and a bottl of coke one burger was made incorrect as they ad grill onion to both i was feel generous and did not ask for a new one i should have though i do not care for onion on the burger the frys were good in fact i could have eaten anoth order 

the cook andi and the waitress were so frazzl by the inspector they kept forget thing like open the bottl of coke ketchup other peopl meal the regular got a doubl when he order 2 singl and made sure andi knew it was 2 singles

th other regular look as if she roll out of bed smoke a j slap her over size headphon and ipod in her pj pocket and rode her bike here she total dump her bike in the front like she own the place andi ask sever time for her to move it but pot head didnt get it 

andi ask the other regular to do someth for him discreet sinc the citi guy was there not sure what but he was outsid for a while 

 i like welcom but with 2 issu in 2 visit i dunno if i will be backi dont want to be controversi but most of these crown review are from those not like to have seen what a true mercado may look like and yes im refer to ethnic  

phoenix ranch market is the knot berri farm to mercado tipico disneyland  it a nobl effort to bring mexican stapl and unconvent to the big citi in the middl of arizona usa but the product are ting with american from their weekend menudo which is wholli rubbish to the carn which is a grade abov what you would get in a true mexican market damn fda  though the latter may sound like an unusu gripe it that stringi gatogrademeat that make fajita and torta uniqu tasti  i was impress one time howev when my buddi graham snag a few pound of fajita meat for the superbowl from phx rm and they marinad it for him in a sturdi plastic bag which includ whole jalapeno to boot  howev i beleiv it was graham skill on the grill that made them veri tasti and moist rather than ani particular amaz grade of meat from the market

a a hispan the place feel appreci disingenu  sure they sell the liquado and the pansito et al but if you plop this place in mexico pt 1 it would fail from poor qualiti by mexican standard  

bi all mean if you dont know the differ then knock it out  you wont know what you are miss anyway and you can get your ethnic dinner parti need and a sandia drink while you waitfrom the outsid this place look as if it would be infest with fli insid and has a fat greasi cook at the grill  i am happi to announc it was neither  i love the look of the furnitur in this place which has old mexican look carv chair  they even ad a jukebox full of spanish music for your own pleasur  i will start with the drink  of cours they have all of the import import beer but the best part about this is that they are cheap almost half the price of most place which will definit keep me come back  i have alway said you can determin how good the mexican food is by the salsa and the rice  the salsa was just the way i like it tasti while eat it and spici when your done  this obvious just make you want more due to the fact that your tongu is still sizzl and crave that hot flavorsom liquid on a crunchi tortilla chip a posit in my book  they even give you an extra bowl to mix both the red and the green togeth  

now onto my meal chile verd burrito with a side of rice  i love to tri this dish at differ place sinc most green salsa all tast differ depend on who make it so differ place meet my crave need  my burrito was ok but i wouldnt rank it up there with the best  it need more flavor and definit more spice  ad the salsa for the chip made it a littl more enjoy  the rice to me was disappoint  mexican rice should be juici and fluffi but instead it was fri and had no flavor  im not too much of a shrimp person but my brother got shrimp colorado which was surpris to me the nonshrimp eater good  in the end the salsa get a check on my list the rice was a negat and the beverag quench my thirst  i will be dine here again but next time i will stay away from their burritothis is the oldest oper soda fountain in the southwest from 1928  good jukebox  and they have real phosphat soda and malt veri veri yummi  as well as your typic soda fountain stuff circa 192850s  it cool as hell but i wish they would have restor the place rather than keep it as is  it a littl rug from the year but veri cute and real  i gotta say  it realli is a must see for allmacalpin soda fountain is all right be me

it a cool place to meet up with some friend for an ice cream treat soda or float  the food is ok not great but not bad either  the servic can be a hit and miss depend on who you get as a server and when you go  the ice cream and soda treat are fantast  the ambianc  the soda bar is cool and there are two side room full of antiqu that are for sale everywher  

ive had their reuben which was aok and on my last trip i sampl their burger and chip with chocol shank which was shankalici   my burger was cook well but noth fanci  i also had a small salad which was nice but not memor  my shake was realli good and left an indel impress on my tast bud 

side note give the dude out front hold the sign we are open for lunch a break and let him come insid where it a littl cooler  use a curbsid sign instead

if your a germophob like me that doesnt like dirti old thing hang everywher especi where you are eat you need to get past that and give macalpin soda fountain a triive gotta go with aok on this one not quit readi to commit to be a fan yet 

to me be a fan would mean i would be will to drive from north central phoenix all the way downtown devilmaycar style on a work day to wait in line and put up with the slam of the metal door everi time a custom lunch order was fulfil that not a complaint mind you it was cool all part of the charm

you see dinner is not an option theyr onli open until 4 

that said i obey robert ms instruct and order a green chile burrito enchilada style with a side of bean the bean were runni but good for dip my bite of burrito the sauc that made it  enchilada style had a good heat 

i was pleas it was aok id go back just probabl not devilmaycar on a work dayyes i am total deduct a star becaus they charg for soda refil not just charg refil price which is ridicul anyway but charg you for a whole addit soda when you get a refil who the eff doe that i can quit honest say im never go here again becaus i onli crave indian when im hungov and full flavor not diet ice cold coke is a hangov necess im not go to pay for each one i down that could bankrupt me plus everyon know fountain soda cost like 4 cent a piec who are they tri to foolthis place make no fuck sens to me

wev gone here numer time for karaok  everi time it been host by someon new occasion necessit midrot staf chang one time this dude who look suspici like comedian anthoni anderson host for all of 20 minut and read my friend name off which had been list as heff as heifer this actual becam realli amus insid joke fodder for the rest of us but i can onli imagin how humili it must be to skulk up to the mic under the alia of a ladycow poor heffe

everi time ive gone into the ladi room here some old bat has either been puke in the onli work stall or show me her wrink tit for some reason unbeknownst to my frail constitut i wont say that this is necessarili characterist of this bar though as most ugli mama in bathroom valleywid will at some point flash me their part 

one time this kid in the park lot who didnt look old enough to drink let alon be a convict rapist ask my friend and i if we a like movi and b want to go watch movi in his car with no regard for how creepi this proposit is 

i will give breakroom some credit though  weve met an interest assort of sociallyawkward senior citizen there and some of the bartend are realli excel all other aspect of this place are total creepi and weird though it fun if your in a group of 6 and your busili get hammer off of pineappl upsid down cakeshot becaus none of the regular there seem interest in sing or social otherwis watch out for park lot creepster and bathroomflash and onli go here for the abil to write a funni anecdot in your memoirafter a trip to target we were hungri so my daughter and i stop in for some dinner here  she love salad bar sinc she can pick out what she like and just eat that  it was about 8pm on a week night so they were not busi  we were greet warm and paid then went to the salad bar  thing had not been restock but that ok there was still plenti and it was good  they had some differ saladan orient noodl one that i like and of cours soup and bread  for dessert they had the soft serv ice cream that is so yummi and lot of top to go with it  

the place was clean and the staff was nice  it noth outstand but it was good and we were full  and it was fair inexpens tooi am not on the chris bianco bandwagon i think his pizza is ok but not near worth an hour wait let alon the 3 to 4 hour actual wait but one thing that mf can make better than anyon els is fresh mozzarella i love mozzarella

so without the wait i can head to pane bianco and get a mozzarella sandwich with fresh basil and tomato on bianco fresh bake bread it all sound veri fresh

dont ask me about ani other sandwich becaus i dont know nor do i care fresh mozzarella some peopl talk about the goat chees sandwich who care fresh mozzarella

most peopl think of pizza when they hear chris bianco all i can think of is fresh mozzarellatotal expect to get my ass kick by the serious pane bianco devote on here but oh well meh i dont like pay 10 for a sandwich and then almost 4 for a side and 23 for a bottl of waterbottl of soda that is not an accept lunch option to me especi when i have yet to patron pane bianco one time and not been hungri an hour later this is the freakin sushi bar of the sandwich world

whil ill agre that the ingredi are fresh you get so few of them it would be difficult to know otherwis ive been sever time now and pretti much alway get the tomatomozz sandwich as i dont eat tuna salad or have a tast for sopressatta the other day howev i got the market sandwich and i was so excit to be abl to tri someth new becaus it had turkey in it 2 whole super thin supermarket look slice of turkey mmmmmm delici giant piec of bread with two super thin slice of turkey in the middl how could i say anyth nasti about pay 10 for you how dare i be hungri an hour later when you made me so full with all of that bread you get the pictur stick the the tomatomozz sandwich if your head this way oh and make sure someon els is pick up this ludicr tabi go back and forth about this place on one hand there are some realli great thing i love build my own sandwich at duck and decant becaus they have so mani great thing to spruce up your order you can add so mani extra to your sandwich to make it delici russian mustard plump juici avocado turkey salad with blue chees sharp cheddar spread yes pleas they also have great fresh brew ice tea everi day in a varieti of unusu flavor im an unsweeten ice tea junki so i love this

on the other hand it take a realli long time to get your food and sometim it tast so blah despit put a crapload of extra and sauc on it then it cost like 10 becaus you had to add all the extra for flavor shouldnt flavor come free

i think it shouldhad to bump gd up to an aok status my advic dont sit at the bar get a tabl where a cool waitress will help you even when it crazi busi bump up one star due to better servicok  now do not judg  normal we do not go to chain restaur but we decid to tri out the wing at applebe  they have there wing for 25 per wing after 11pm everyday  

so  the wing were not all that bad for the price  we order them hot and they came out a littl spici  also when you order the wing you have to buy 10 to get them at 25 per wing  

sinc we were at applebe the server was realli good he did a great job take care of us  

if you decid to go to applebe for a late night snack  you should tri out the wingthere is a lot of hype for this pretti averag sandwich joint my cowork and i heard about this place through a list of 20 great american sandwich shop and it appar even had an oprah mention after see these glow review here as well i was pretti much certain that i would be let down in some way but it hard to even imagin the reason for the hype this place achieved

it is an extrem tini shop stuck at the end of the strip mall with central music it so tini ive park in front of it befor and havent even notic it the insid look to have been renov circa 1982 with faux wood panel and shelv and vintag boar head advertis that have been left to rot the menu spread out across the entir wall on a confus mix of chalk board and comput print out the eat space is an extrem claustrophob setup of fold tabl and chair stuck between the deli counter and the halfass market shelv that sport intern item that were most cover with a thick layer of dust

th actual sandwich solid qualiti deli stuff use primarili boar head meat and chees that it whi would you fall in love with this place i went with five other guy who order a mix of their signatur sandwich doughboy bizmark manhattan and all agre you can get a similar sandwich at groceri store and prefer even the like of sack to this place there is just noth invent about the sandwich or anyth that stand out here other then the friend mom and pop ownership and sweet vintag signthis is one of those place that is basic overr just becaus of it locat and longev there are so few place that have surviv in the downtown phoenix area for as long as china chili has and for that it probabl doe deserv a lot of credit 

that be said it basic an averag chines restauant comfort conveni clean and it offer all the standard fare it everyth youll need for a weekday dinner but not much more

tri the sizzl rice soup it veri good plus jerri colangelo is known to take out their sweet n sour shrimpor is it the chicken who care either way that pretti cooldairi queen or dirti queen and im not talk about my femmi neighbor with the member onli jacket drench in patchouli realli it not work your just stinki but this dq could use a visit from mr clean and the brawni paper towel guy both of whom ive had huge crush on napkin paper and spoon on the floor behind the counter wasnt a pretti pictur either they werent busi and should have been clean you know what they sayif there time to lean there time to clean howev my simpl littl vanilla cone realli hit the spot for that2 star staff was friend one more total three stari like come to this qdoba becaus it is close to my hous and my offic  sometim i will come here on my lunch break or i will come here for dinner with friend on the weekend  it is a small shop in the central park shop center 

mi favorit thing to get here is the craft 2  you can pick from a varieti of thing  for exampl you can get taco tortilla soup quesadilla or a nake taco salad  i alway get two soft taco and two hard taco  

the downsid on this qdoba is that they are close on sunday and they are not open veri late on friday and saturdayi havent been here sinc it was call sonora not much has chang the food is pretti decent i no longer drink alcohol so i got the rootbeer it pretti good i actual like stevia and was happier know there was no sugar or hfcs

i actual like the fact a restaur is tri to get away from hfcs kudos

i tri the buffalo i kinda thought it was a burgerbut onli becaus i wasnt realli pay attent  but it was tasti 3 bast chicken strip on a roll with lettuc and tomato and nasti red onionnonot say their red onion was nastyi just dont like red onion on sandwich sorri 

anywaysthey ad sweet potato fri to the menu and they were pretti good they crinkl cut themi think it add more to the experi35 star cherryblossom noodl cafe is a realli good concept  it a shame that phoenix is lack on option when it come to noodl hous chicago new york and dc have noodl galor but were not there yet i guess  anyway cherryblossom has a welcom ambianc and decent servic too ive been a few time so i figur it would be the perfect place to stop for a late dinner last night after urban affair  it was friday night around 930 so no problem get in and seat right away

w sat at the bar and got drink immedi  sinc the bf had alreadi eaten a bunch of appet at the event we were at he said hed just share whatev i order  so i chose the miso eggplant appet and the yaki udon noodl entre with tofu  the eggplant dish was realli tasti but they serv it straight from the stove and we both burn our mouth take the first bite  we had to let it sit anoth few minut to cool down enough to eat it  note  im not complain id rather have my food serv too hot than not hot enough   

we finish the eggplant dish up right as the noodl dish arriv  the noodl themselv were cook just right but the dish had a weird flavor to it  it just didnt tast right or mayb it was just noth special  either way i would skip the yaki udon and go for someth els on the menu when you go

although i wouldnt rave about the food on my most recent visit to cherryblossom it was quick and cheap for a latenight dinner  we were in and out in less than an hour and it was 20 out the door with tip  cant complain about that  ill be backthis was our first time at cherryblossom hubbi has need to eat more vegetarian late so ive been on the lookout for new place with more option 

the food was most great hubbi enjoy his tofu yakisoba i like my chicken katsu although a coupl of piec were not quit done love my salad like the bread basket and we both realli enjoy the crispi california roll dessert was also pretti good we like my flan better than his green tea mouss which was not veri sweet except for the almond flavor cream on top 

servic was attent in the begin and then our waiter disappear i wit two other tabl in our section grow confus and then annoy as we wait and wait and wait for the waiter to return one coupl was even in midpay and final went to the take out counter to inquir what was happen i ask the busser to let the wait know we want our check this disappear act realli took the shine off of an otherwis nice dinner well like return howev to give cherryblossom anoth chanchighlight of christos
 the neighborhoodi italian cafe feel of the restaurant
 decent food with runofthemil upscal italian variety
 piano jazz player serenad guests
 crowd with a decid oldmoney north central phoenix feel as oppos to the i eat cat food and go to buffet sun citi feel 
 profession server with the memori of an eleph and the attitud of a menopaus woman

i had not been to christo in a few year but upon return i found the food and atmospher to be just as consist  the restaur is veri neighborhoodi and invit the white tablecloth and piano player in the corner set the mood just right you see diner here run into old friend at the bar i did as well  littl old bitti threw their judg look our way from the bar sinc our tabl of 20 is young most femal we must all be lesbian right   right  

consist good food not great and not excel but good   modest soup and side salad here are part of the drill  i order the chicken limon bread and prepar similar to chicken picatta but minus the caper  i tast my friend grill salmon and penn and it was delici consid out larg parti the restaur handl us ok especi given the the busy of the even sinc it was dine out for life even where they donat proceed toward hiv charities

i extend the benefit of the doubt but express concern over the somewhat long wait time   it was near 10 pm when we left given our 730 reserv in which we were prompt seat  our server  who was skill at recit the dozen or so special of the day was accommod up until the bill situat which i prepar him for beforehand  when he turn a littl catti but all was well in the end this is a 3 star place with potenti for four stargood food though i didnt find ani of the dish outstand and there were not as mani offer as i would have expect for a super buffet the varieti of dish was pretti much what you would expect for an aboveaverag chines buffet the staff was veri friend the restaur spacious and the meal was inexpens and satisfi  a good meal at a good pricei can onli comment on the breakfast although id like to come back for lunch as the deli seem great  i had the kelli american toast which is french toast made with challah and a side of bacon  the french toast was too much for even my heavyweight appetit to consum  it was veri tasti richer and chewier becaus of the challah  the bacon was thick highqual meati bacon  not a fan of the orang juic definit from concentr  also i dont care for eat on or drink from plastic as you do here  im not a germaphob but it seem like it wouldnt get as clean  

veri casual seat yourself  dont be put off if you walk in and dont see ani tabl by the deli  look to your right  there a whole other room where we found plenti of seat  we enjoy look at some of the photo on the wall all taken in new york  would come again if in the neighborhoodaye pancho   
when your good your veri veri good but when your bad your horrid

okay so here the secret to a potenti enjoy or at least toler dine experi in a cheap ass dive of a restaurant
go know itll suck  go becaus it is a consist suck and the suck you know is better than the suck you dont
you may end up pleasant surpris  happen to me all the time

if you dont expect it to tast like a pizza at all a totino frozen cracker with sauc and top can actaulli be a littl tasty

pancho has all that i love in a cheapo boofay  there a lot of varieti to choos from and of cours as much as you can stuff in your gullet  they even have the ad benefit of a server to bring you your second and beyond  i just wish the food was more consistent
if you go on a day that the cook know what theyr do with the fryer it make all the differ in the world  there are a lot of item that are cook that way  chicken taquito turkey flauta tortilla chip sopaipilla etc  that are so good when they achiev the proper consist on the delic crispygreasi spectrum but so nasti when they are not
th salsa are actual pretti good  they have a few from which to choos from mild and tomatoey to a chunkyhot roast number  they use to have one of the better tomatillo salsa verd ive had but i dont think they make it anymore

your best bet seem to be to avoid the busiest time with the most children  lunch or late weeknight should be okay  unless your bring a group of kid who should love it here

on bad day it easili a 1 but on good day it can be a 35 so im go with a rate of 3 as long as you go know what to expect

to a realist the glass is alway full  half with water half with air  
i eat at crappi place and enjoy it
ston methere just someth miss at coup des tart how do they say je ne sai quoi

th interior ambianc is perfect probabl the highlight

on my most recent visit i had the three onion tart which has a love sweet flavor and the salmon the salmon was so ordinari it was cook well but someth was miss from the prepar for me howev i love love love the savori butternut squash risotto if onli the salmon had been as ah mah zing cite the menu as the risotto was

iv had the chicken option befor too it was just fine 

but noth has blown me away 

and bring your own wine to enjoy has the potenti to realli compliment the whole experi make it richer  the fact that itll cost you 9 minimum just to open it a task you liter do yourself is a sore spot for me i think that cork fee is waaay too high 

it fun to go to coup des tart becaus the ambianc and you know youll order a tart for dessert it like that youll enjoy dessert is guarante  but there someth  that je ne sai quoi that still lackwhip into this nutti place for lunch today join by mike c  jacki c  yes it just as crazi on the insid as the outsid  i went with a club sandwich  fri plus we share some ranch dress  parmesan wings

th best

  you want a place that differ  has charact  this place is about as screwi as they get insid  out     

  good menu offer various sandwich pizza  chicken wing of assort flavor and more     

  my sandwich fri  the chicken wing were all good     

  1960s theme 1960s price  my real club sandwich with a full size side of fri was onli 500  can you imagin     

     

the rest

  the tripl deck club sandwich blt  turkey was onli cut in half  this sandwich is usual serv quarter  also i wasnt offer a bread choic  didnt think to speak up so it came on white toast which wouldnt have been my prefer     

  this place is dumpi but that shouldnt be a surpris to anyon     

the singl bathroom is scari     o

  the servic was friend but it took a while to get our order  everybodi food didnt show up even close to the same time     

     

will i come back  probabl     im on a greek rampag i was told that bacchan is the place to go i have to say i am dissapoint my friend and i arriv sat in the back corner or an 80s theme restaur oh that wasnt a theme unless the food speak for itself i would opt for a remodel

th food doe not speak for itself

i order the vegetarian moussaka
vegetarian moussaka  1500
slice of eggplant and potato layer with zucchini spinach and feta chees top with béchamel cream and parmesan cheese

i have to say the actual moussaka was delici but it came with veget that i swear were straight from a can mushi tasteless
it was a littl while ago so i cant recal what my coadventur order but i do rememb the look on their face when the belli dancer came out it was more of a squint sinc the dancer was so far from us all tuck in the back corner like lepers

reserv are recommend for optim belli dancer view but

som would argu that you wouldnt realli  want to be that close

w arriv on a night when a good portion of the restaur was reserv for an engag parti a woman name athena was get marri appropri anyway the whole entertain side was cater to that parti and my guest and i had the distinct feel that we were crash my big fat greek enagag party

next time i would suggest reserv and some social lubric in the park lot befor enter prefer from an ouzo bottl in a paper bagmy biggest pet peev is a cold restaur i hate be cold and uncomfort when im eat this place is cold 

i have been to this 5 and diner probabl 5 or 6 time pretti much the same as ani other 5d you have ever been to this locat has pretti averag servic 

they have great milkshak but mediocr food i normal onli eat breakfast here my dine parti seem to enjoy their food 

they do have comfi booth which allow for a nice nap if you are narcolept like me35 star decent upscal american restaur cater to older steakseafood eaters

i went there for a work dinner with 10 peopl and was pretti excit at first with it slick interior design and good look menu but was consist let down throughout the evening

i got my first warn sign as i start look around look at the clientl it look someon start hand out 50 dollar gift certif for pcg at lubi the night befor with a crowd that old and tame i knew the food wouldnt have as much flavor as i look for

next my pomegran margarita arriv which tast like what pomegran koolaid would tast like if they made such a thing im not sure if it even had alcohol in it i switch to their draft beer which are from sever small breweri and much more worth your time

next came my ahi tuna special which was definit not worth the price tag veri bland didnt seem like they should even be serv it if they dont know how to make it interest although the rice side dish that came with it was great other in my group who had steak salmon and such were much more pleased

i gave them a chanc to redeem themselv with their croissant bread pud which sound phenomen especi to a bread pud man like myself again it was fair par for the cours and not worth it price tag the bread pud at sonora brew hous is world better for less money

it seem like a great place to take your parent or peopl who like meat without much spice and drink without much alcohol but it definit not a place for mei woke up late on a saturday and i was crave indian food to my relief it was almost lunch time i rememb that there was an indian restaur close to me that i had been mean to tri i head to flavor of india to tri their lunch buffet i walk in and i was immedi greet i note the bollywood video play in the background i love those dang video the host was also my waiter he invit me to help myself to the buffet im not one of those peopl that know the name of each and everi dish as i write this im kick myself for not take note as a whole the buffet was aok noth in particular knock my sock off i did notic that noth was power flavor it was kind of a safe season restaur i would visit flavor of india again there was plenti of food the buffet had a lot of varieti and the servic was goodknock a star off for you rokerij believ me this hurt me more than it hurt you i visit last sunday and our servic was friend but it didnt make up for the poor deliveri of food and the problem with solv issu that we had i have onli had the small plate from rokerij this trip i decid to tri some of their new mexican offer  my appet order which was specif state to be an appet not an entre came with my entre consid the appet did not even have to be cook steak tartar that unaccept when i comment on it i got a ugh i know right umreal my entre which was the rokerij sampler was meh the best part of the dish was the benedict the enchilada were bland and plain old mush  i had dinner with my best friend amber and my good friend ayesha ayesha had me sampl her enchilada as she has specif ask that she not be serv pork i bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of ayesha plate when the waiter was flag down he said hm not sure what to do about this realli luckili befor i went off like a powder keg he offer to remak them he didnt comp anyth for the obvious mistak that were made i hope he realiz that there were some booboo made when he saw his tip was so small i hope to give back the star i just took away but theyr go to have to wow me to do that it too bad that this trip was so disappointfirst time everrrrrr that i wish yelp had a half star the pizza is great the wing are good the servic is aw that combin  35 stars

i was in the area and want to tri more place that serv wing after my awesom luck at long wong nypd has an express lunch area which has a differ menu than the normal dinein menu i went with a sicilian slice alreadi cook and on display and 6 wing there was onli one other tabl 2 peopl in the lobbi so i figur id get my food within a reason amount of time  

i wait over 30 minut to get that veri simpl dish and it came with one celeri stick i ask for more celeri so the waitress brought out two celeri stick really

i would eat here again but onli through deliverito say that this place has capit on the notorieti creat by diner drivein and dive is quit an understat  they have more pictur of guy fieri in that place than i own pictur of myself  i digress

 been by that locat a thousand time and it took that stupid show to get me in the door  i am quit surpris becaus i usual do a good job of be inform of great place and ive probabl eaten at 56 other italian place all within 5 mile of that place  i digress again

anyway ive been a coupl of time now  for lunch and for dinner  the sandwich offer at lunch are both tasti and reason price  they are not notabl uniqu in ani way but the qualiti is present  the pasta serv at dinner were more distinguish  the bolognes is the second best in phoenix behind pino  the osso buco get a lot of attent and right so  the servic has been abov par on both visits

al told a great neighborhood place to eat if you live or work in the neighborhood  just not quit good enough to merit the trek by itselfwent here with my sis today she never want to go to fez sigh i had the falafel pita and she had the ceaser one i had the passion fruit tee yummmmm i almost walk out with the glass i didnt want to put it down it was so good our pita came out hekka quick the giant falafel ball were ok mayb a bit hard and dri in the center but pretti tasti my sister chicken was a tad burnt around the edg but she ate it all anyway next time i want to tri the homemad sangria it sound lovedarn i thought id be the first to review zen 32 hmmm appar the 32 stand for 32nd street zen on 32nd street oh how terribl clever i just assum after a few visit there the 32 stood for the number of minut you wait befor your server arriv i get the style over substanc restaur sometim it about the scene and not the grub and sometim that what im up for and that what zen 32 is to me averag sushi qualiti not as horrif as some have yelp word like crap horrif vomit realli not veri zen of them eh i wont go out of my way to think of zen but if someon invit me im inclin to say yes theyr open pretti late by then im readi for some drink and mayb a bite or two of the fishi most it a place to peopl watch visit and take bet on when youll ever see your server againthe food was pretti disappoint for the price and the drink menu left much to be desir  the music was ok and the servic was veri close to onpoint for the size of the parti  the space is tremend as mani have said it one of the veri few place like it in phoenix with real histori  i just wish they would bring the kitchen and bar up to the same level as the locatmy wife and i went here friday night  our plan was to sit in the loung enjoy a few cocktail and have some appet and a burger  this plan was thwart when the bar tender look at me like i was insan when i ask about their burger  he told us they havent had a burger in year  the bar menu on their websit clear state that they have a burger which was perfect becaus my wife and i werent in the mood for the fanci fare of their main dine room

w sat at a tabl on their patio  the weather was perfect and the view was even better  we order our first round of drink and yes they do jack you on the price but that was to be expect  we then order some food to share

 flat bread pizza thing  excellent
 beet salad  pretti good and pretti uniqu  i cant explain it but it is worth a try
 oyster  not so good  i have no idea whi we got this but for some reason my wife want it so go figure
 truffl mac n chees  omg  best  thing  ever

th mansion itself is beauti but could use a bit of updat especi on the insid  i do regret howev not explor the mansion as much as i should have  we pretti much stuck to one small wing of the place but there was probabl so much more to it than we saw

ohand their park situat is a complet clusterfuk  the signag tell you where to park where the valet is and how to get to the mansion entranc is a complet joke and almost nonexist  would it kill them to have morebigg sign and mayb some light so you can see them

 pro tip  get the 50 local dine gift cert for 25  httpbitlydfr4eq   of cours they will complain and tri to tell you all the rule that somehow arent list anywher  they will even tri to tell you what dinner food is and what is not  just tell them that if you want oyster and vodka for dinner then that is your choic  if they want you to get a 65 steak in the main dine room they should clear say that on the offerwell let me start by say if your not in great shape triathlet dont even attempt to take the stair that lead up to the mansion i mean there realli should be some warn that if your over age 50 you may not make it up there so with that be said i think it is clear a ruse to make sure you pay for valet park becaus if you drive to the top of the hill they will glad park your car for you and you can walk right into the mansion 

we had dinner at geordi restaur becaus they were offer a 30 per person 3 cours meal to promot restaur week here in phoenix the food was pretti goodnot great the servic was pretti goodbut not great the mansion was pretti goodbut not great howev the view was greatw got to see the sun sunset along with the beauti mountain so at least that was a treat we didnt have dessert but the offer on the menu look goodbut not great

so i guess you see my point this place is goodnot greatso if that is what your look for then eat drink and be merri my friendwith an ident chang this restaur is all locat architectur  super stylish sexi ambianc 

after 23 year great epicurean servic to the citi of phoenix houston move across the street to their own new stand alon build who figur out your park quota

they spare no expens as far as make a magnific 5 star atmospher present the ambianc of this restaur is off the chart if you have a date you want to impress or client you want to razzl dazzl this place is off the hook this restaur is much more formal so dress well  

so whi didnt i give them five star 

well i wait for sever month befor go in so the hoopla had die down  they would have a chanc to fix ani corki thing you get with a new establish the server all had the same well train houston march armyteam get your dish to your tabl as quick as possibl the onli problem was they kept bring out someon els dish i mean the wrong appet came out than the wrong dish  final the wrong dessert the first time i shrug it off as it happen but after the second time i was a littl concern i dont like other patron breath on my food

th food qualiti is exact the same as all the other houston restaur they are use prettier dishwar than befor  the dish have smaller portion area on them my thai salad was 30 smaller than it use to be in houston serious the price did go up again which i didnt like but you are get better ambianc they also ad sushi to the menu

th ambianc the outsid wait area rock garden with fire place  fountain is veri romant great place to have a few drink with a date befor dinner the bar is wide open  veri loud a great place to check out member of the opposit sex a lot of hot cougar congreg here in twos  three the restaur although veri noisi is sexi  stylish

did i mention the price went up 
i use to frequent houston sever time a week becaus i thought it was a great valu for the dine experi  i regular go there alon for lunch or happi hour  sit  the bar alon  inevit meet a friend i just dont see that happen herei scream  you scream  we all scream for icecream  or so the say goe not so much at b  r on camelback though there are 2 big disappoint factor about this b r

 1  unfriend employe ive been in on sever occas and not onc have i seen an employe smile or be anyth other than monotone

 2  no soft serve

so it fine to get a scoop or two but honest id much rather drive the extra 20 minut and go to ice tangot cook use to be our old faith when we had someon in from out of town and want to show them that phoenix wasnt just about golf corpor resort and chain restaur the royal palm is still our goto recommend for visitor with a hefti budget t cook not so much

47 year ago it was a 5star review in my book although t cook is still usual a good meal it not a great meal especi for the price the menu has stop go anywher and the execut is spotti on last visit my ravioli appet even came out san sauc on accid and when you have thing like paella from a woodfir oven on the menu youd expect them to tast inspir and authent but im usual let down their pesto and bread is still out of this world though a meal in itself

mi wife and i got engag at the royal palm for awhil we made t cook our anniversari dinner so well keep go back to trp for the fireplac and cocktail but i think well hold off on t cook until we hear that thing have chang for the betteri havent eaten food from mcdonald in year but ive stop by this mickey ds locat sever time recent for their ice cream cone 

164 for two ice cream cone you cant beat that  and they are reducedfat too

for those that want someth fancier they also offer mcflurri the mcdonald version of dq blizzard with top such as oreo cooki mms and rolo and sunda with hot fudg hot caramel and strawberri  

as their slogan goe im lovin iti have realli mix emot about sack 

on one hand the baguett bread is soft and chewi the sandwich are creativ my cowork both realli like the jazz and the gothic if you dont see a sandwich on the menu you want you can creat your own they use spici brown mustard yummi the caesar salad is good servic is quick and you get a cooki with all sandwich and salad

on the other hand it get realli crowd if you dont get there by 1130 am or arriv after 1245 pm the park lot is super small so you typic have to park at first watch there is a sign that drink refil are for the larg size onli i have ignor that sign as i find it ridicul that they could actual monitor who refil and doesnt it get veri veri noisi so it is hard to hear the peopl sit at your own tabl and i think the price is a bit high for a sandwich shop about 9 for an 8 inch sandwich chip and a regular soda which appar i cant refill

sack is nice occasion but i hate to admit when i am realli crave a sandwich or sub i usual run to subway where i can get a meal for almost half the price of sacklook for a casual lunch spot with moder price and a larg select of sandwich salad drink etc look no further than sack  not onli do they deliv on the attribut i mention abov but they also deliv liter with a minimum 25 order and they charg just a gratuiti that goe to the driver

i use to frequent this sack when they were locat at 48th st and indian school and just recent rememb that they reloc just down the street at 42nd and indian school  ive been sever time in the last few week and have been a satisfi custom for sure  

i usual go for their cobb salad no onion and add avocado with balsam dress  i love that sack is fine with modif to their menu item  im also a fan of their egg salad the sack symphoni sandwich and the sack impressionist sandwich  i love that they have snappl drink and lot of ice tea fountain option as well as sun chip  their cooki they come with everi meal are anoth nice perk if your not watch your sweet intake

i must say i do miss the cracker that they use to serv with the salad awhil back  perhap they will bring those back sometim soon

i have yet to take advantag of the deliveri servic mention abov but i do plan on use that in the futur when i cant get away to pick up or eat there  glad to have yet anoth reliabl lunch option in the hoodi agre that la grand orang is over corpor i also agre that the park suck hellif you have a complaint about la grand orang i probabl agre with it if i didnt work just a mile away i probabl would never make the trek to this place 

howev id still probabl give lgo three star for two reason 

1 the sandwich  all that ive tri are solid good and not too expens given similar price sandwich elsewher in the area
2 the great select of artisan product and uniqu gift  back in decemb i found some amaz stuff over lunch to give to some of my friend and famili for christmas

if you are ani of the follow id recommend check lgo out

com in from out of town and look for a breakfast or lunch spot that more of a destination
a local resid that want a place to hang out on a lazi weekend morning
someon who work nearbi and has the opportun to take a leisur lunch

 if not skip the drive and look for a local place that isnt as overhyp or crowdalright ill be honest ive been an lgo hater for year now as far as i was concern it was an overhyp overpr chi chi trinket store for peopl with way too much money to blow on crap they dont need oh and they had some food too but not near as much as they did 19 candi and who doesnt love 19 candy

now all of my previous sentiment are still exact the same i still think it is all those thing that i did befor but they have at least up a place in my heart stomach due to the best freakin blt ive ever had for real their avocado blt is to die for glorious slice of bacon stack on top of glorious slice of bacon on top of more and more bacon for mile and goooood bacon fresh avocado tomato and lettuc as well to boot also came with a delici slice of pineappl on the side which was one of the ripest ive had out here in a while so kudo to that as well

so while i dont see myself patron the establish on my own terribl often next time my boss want to spend an exorbit amount of money on my lunch again im comin for my blt with open armi like the hustl and bustl go down in here come from other metro area there just isnt enough of that feel for me in phoenix

mi espresso drink was good

i snif the cheeses

i have noth els inform to add on la grand orange

bonn journé lgogrocerichain alert
thi place is a chain but it is a decent meal  yes it is slight over price and the food isnt the greatest  the atmospher is a cross between rubio and joe crab shack and the servic is compar as well

i order the fri whitefish taco see pic and i got a littl chip and salsa from the salsa bar here how the meal pan out

th taco were great  the baja sauc was not the typic white sauc  it look more like fri sauc if your from utah but it tast great  i mix it with a tablespoon of their red hot sauc  the bean were unmash pinto which i prefer over everyth except whole black bean they were decent noth great i mix in a bit of pico de gallo to flavor them up a bit the rice was horrid  i hate to say it but you know those grain of rice that arent cook  the hard one that break your teeth from the outsid in yeah those were random encount dure consumpt  not a pleasant experi the portion were small but i didnt complain becaus the taco were actual pretti good they were crispi and you could tell they were batter and fri to order surprising

th salsa bar was mediocr  the red hot sauc was more vinigarri word than delici hot and the pico de gallo was made from can tomato  the chip were so old that by the time i got to them they were broken shard of their former selv piti i was look for a good chip pig out

th servic was veri good  the first waitress told me to seat myself and to come up and order at my conveni  when i did anoth waitress took my order prompt  the wait wasnt long it was about 5 minut from order to receiv my food  the tabl were quick clean and everyon seem happi the custom and the employe  it was a veri comfort and pleasant setting

okay i get it pizza nazi 
it veri offputting
hav a littl faith in your custom were not all assholbocc ball that was a some spici tortillion
what do you think about when you think about bocc 
i knowmi thought turn immedi to mexican food too
aunt chilada has set up a bocc court right next to the walkway in the courtyard when i first saw the bocc court it was jarringlik walk by the sushi bar at houstonsjust becaus you can doesnt mean you should 
but someon near the top of the chilada famili may in fact be a market genius that thing realli got a workout while we were there the other day
th beauti carin and i hadnt been back to tia chilada in a year or so but we need to reconnoitermi strong and handsom son zachari and his love wife sarah are visit next week and they want to go good memori of anoth great visit
w wander in at happi hour absolut the best time to visit the chilada famili 
lot of peopl drink eat chip and salsa etc though not as mani as past visitsth economi 
we had no troubl get a nice tabl out in the patio area so we could watch an italian sport stapl be play in a mexican restaurant
th peopl watch at aunt chilada is wonderfulal walk of life all shape and sizesal get their drink on with cheap margarita and cheaper cerveza it a tri and true formula for the transit from drone infest uptight i know a word right out of the 60s workaday world to a somewhat more relax slight or heavili inebri nighttim world 
so much fun to watchesp the guy with a six pack of margarita under his belt tri to bowl the bocc 
it would be pretti tough to generat a bocc injuri but i think he manag it
th servic was a pretti goodw never had to wait too long for refil and they kept the chip and salsa come  the flour tortilla chip are one of the best part of aunt chiladas
carin had a servic chicken chimichanga and i had someth call a tortillion which interest enough is numer base nomenclatur for this dish reflect the number of calori per servingshred beef chees bean tomato bacon bacon wrap in a giant tortilla dip in egg batter and deepfriedit sound better than it was but i ate about  12 and brought the rest home might still be in the fridg growl at menot sureafraid to look
nop it not the best mexican restaur in town and it not the best bocc court youll ever see but combin they make aunt chilada a decent place to have a bite and a cocktail and to play the game that peopl playbirthday parti 30 peopl buffet style
i wouldnt go there again but it was nice enough for that night 
food wasnt spectacular and there wasnt ani sort of view
i guess it a great place for a parti thoughwhile stay at the point hilton tapatio we decid to eat here for our anniversari dinner to sum it up ive had everyth better somewher els noth blew my sock off 

hubbi is eat most vegetarian right now due to a health concern and he did realli like his wild mushroom rigatoni we werent sure what was so wild about crimini and portobello but the pasta was in a light sauc with plenti of other veggi his french onion soup was better at capit grill my antipasto plate was far better at craftsteak and my ribey was far better at 1130 they did serv a neat wedg of au gratin potato multipl paper thin cheesi slice cut into a triangl the gin are standard but hubbi had a nice bonni doon riesl the free anniversari creme brule was on the runni side the vanilla was indiscern and the sugar crust was too thick ruth chris still win that one in my book did i feel dinner was worth 120 not so much

th servic at dinner was great and it was fine at breakfast again everyth was decid mediocr and way overpr ive had a better belgian waffl at ihop my bacon was limp and the coffe not what i would expect from the hilton hubbi blt breakfast bagel was better

com on hilton is this the best you can doi realli want this place to be more than except but after the second visit month after the first i can onli say this  you pay too much for the view
th servic is veri oldfashion and veri dote but the menu need a rethink  time have chang but this place is stuck in the 90s  bottom line it is an over expens resort restaur with ok food and exhorbit pricethough this place truli look like a dive i had high expect  for the food at least  becaus of a glow review i read in one of the local journal the place look a tad decrepit and while the tabl look clean their surfac did have a bit of a sticki feel to them on one occas i had the huaracha recommend by the review i read it was a generous portion of food and it tast good though it was a bit on the dri side on a second visit this time with my friend rand r i order a varieti of street taco  al pastor carn asada carnita and chorizo they were veri good especi when you add the salsa offer on the side the horchata i order with the taco was good and was the perfect  accompani fo the taco in all my dine experi here were aok though id rather go to taco atoyac for similarlypr  but higherqu food  and tabl with a cleaner feelsever of us yelper gather to watch the cardin beat the eagl yesterday ok there were a coupl of eagl fan in the group   servic was friend but slow  it didnt help that the waitress assign chang for some of our group partway through the game  the place was pack and everyth was stretch to the limit  glasswar becam a problem and for a while beer came in room temperatur glass and mix drink were come in whatev vessel could be found  from what i saw and tast of the food it was all ok except for the one salad i saw come out some of it compon look like what the rabbit had refus to eat  i wouldnt drive across town to go there by myself but would if anoth gather were to be calldamn you yelp for your no half star i guess i will have to write the review and then decid between 3 and 4 after i brain dump 

i have been to gallagh twice now the first time for saturday night karaok and the second for the final playoff game go card over the span of those two visit i have tri quit a few item 

the nacho are realli realli good they use nacho sauc versus shred chees which i happen to think is pretti tasti howev the salad i order left quit a bit to be desir i kept get the crunchi gross part of the lettuc head so onli half of my salad was edibl the cooki sunda was pretti damn good as well i have also had the chees crisp which i have no complaint about 

perhap the best thing about this place is the 3 well drink i am use to pay 59 for a damn vodka tonic so i was pleasant surpris when i paid under 10 for three drink 

now servic here is anoth stori im sorri to say that both time it has left someth to be desir i complet understand that the place was pack on a footbal day but the whole place was reserv in advanc so i feel like they should have been more prepar i had to ask for lime three time and wait twenti minut to get one it also took almost forti minut to get my damn nacho when i first show up 

anoth flaw they put baconchicken on my salad even though i specif said no meat and had previous told the waitress i was vegetarian when i order nacho 

oooooo now that i think about it the veri worst part of my experi was that we were seat near the patio so everi time someon open the door the cigarett smoke rush in my eye were water and i was cough the whole time it was pretti uncomfort actual 

overal gallagh is a pretti good sport bar with relat good food and great price drink but there are definit some servic issu 

damn i still cant choos between a 3 and 4  i know i will be back  im go with 3 and if im impress next time i will updat your basic neighborhood sport bar  been here a few time over the last few year and what can i say the beer is cold the food is basic bar food dont expect much and you wont be disappointed

that iti had the boofay yesterday with ryan c it was good i like be abl to tri it all and figur out what i do not like 

there was noth that was realli bad and noth that was realli great it was all good 

the coconut chicken soup thing was a littl odd but the chicken in it was realli good qualiti and tast good while ad to other type of sauc 

oh yeah they paint and re decor it look realli good in thereit had fallen off my radar a bit but i came for dinner earlier this week got the pasta with clam holi moley ive never seen so mani tini littl clam 21  see the photo 

four in the shell and countless babi clam compliment by leek and garlic

bi the time i had finish the pasta there was still a bed of clam on my plate i got a to go contain for the littl bugger and figur ill add them to some sauc and pasta at home for round 2

entre come with salad and bread

salut mean cheer and lucki for us they have some delici wine to say it withchile relleno plate was pretti good here the bean were good the rice was meh the chip and 2 diff salsa were good tast fresh it didnt take long and horchata was good all in all i will stop here again and tri some other dish sinc it realli close to my new padjust not all that  pretti much bar food

a yelper recommend this place as be the best cheesesteak in town  sad my cheesesteak   was  well  just a pretti good cheesesteak  i guess i dont know how you can screw up or enhanc such a thing so i dont know what i was expecting

th atmospher is straight up sport bar and they seem to dress their waitress in hootersesqu top  not my thing  

not a bad place  just therei was hungri and crabbi want somewher to eat and look crabbi without be judg a saloon in a crappi part of bell rd would do 

i load the 9 year old up and head out 

i pass all the fast food place and chain not even talk to the kid as we went i realli didnt care where she want to go 

i saw wagon wheel and made a hard right here come the grumbl and bitchen what no grumbl just a what is this place sweet score one for crappi exterior and random signage

w walk in and wait for about 20 second befor the waitress  escort us to the dingi tabl with odd size butt cushion 

she rambl the kid meal item and ask what we want to drink and vanish she return to drop the drink but befor i could ask she vanish againdamn she is quick she return to take the order and i had to ask about the kid meal she explain and ask if we need more time of cours we do we just now know what you have 

she return and we order 16 mild wing  30 a pop 10 for the kid and 6 for me i order the burger med rare with chees and all the fixin 

the wing arriv a littl befor the burger but that was ok gave time to cool down the were tini and over cook but they gave us like 1819 to make up for it the spice was surpris good for mild and they gave a shit ton of veggi with it the ranch was water down and tast like it 

the burger was said to be 12 lb but i doubt it was it was cook under rare which is better then too much to me 

to quot a fellow yelper chris r bbq king

mi burger was darn big i must say and was cook nice the problem is that it didnt have ani flavor it appear to be handmad but didnt have ani season and didnt have the best tast i saw on the menu they were offer dish that were char grill but am surpris they didnt cook the burger on the grill i think that would have been the differ along with a littl bit of season salt and some pepper

i could not have said it better 

the place need a good fricken clean but realli who eat off the back of dirti chair or use the restroom realli 

as long as i do not get sick from the burger i will be back monday is 1095 prime rib and it look good too bad the bitch befor me got the last one 

total meal was just over 12 buck for a burger 16 wing a shit ton of veggi and a pop i tip a littl extra becaus the cheap ass who had rib eye the tabl over stif her with a whole 2 buck fucker 

go but do not expect anyth more then what we have describ you may like it i didwe were out this way yesterday just explor and when we drove by my daughter said that look like a good place so we had an earli dinner there  

i like the atmospher cool and laid back veri island like  there is surf stuff all over and surf video on and the staff is friend and laid back too  we had great servic  drink arriv prompt and we were check on sever time dure the meal  my daughter had an accid with her milkshak and our server brought her anoth one quick napkin to wipe up with and wet wipe for her sticki hand  

i had the baja soft taco  they were good but lack somethingi dont know what though  i had guac sour cream and salsa too  they were good but they need more flavor  mayb it was the way the chicken was cook im not sure  my daughter had a kid meal of a hot dog and fri and she ate it all  i would probabl go back and tri a burger sometime

most i thought the atmospher was good veri island ish and i like italong with karri i would give them 25 star if i could

i had a busi lunch here the other day  time was limit and it made sens to grab lunch at the hilton where sever of the parti were stay 

i play it safe with a chicken quesadilla  it was better than averag for about 10 buck  it came with generous side of guacamol and sour cream

th servic was good  prompt and effici without be obtrus  

rimrock bar  grill is not a place i would ever seek out but safe and decent food for a hotel restaurive seen this place ride on the lightrail but have not stop here until now becaus they a do not have thier own stop and it requir me to drive down and b are not open past 4 on saturday and are close on sunday  

so i final drag myself down there on saturday for some bbq  the place is part of a realli nice clean littl strip mall with adaqu park  place has adaqu seat and you order at the counter  no waiter servic here which is fine by me

they have lunch and dinner option and be that i wasnt all that hungri for a dinner plate on a saturday afternoon i went for a beef brisket sandwich  the lunch menu is more ala cart  no side and you chose what you want to go with your order  the ladi at the regist said it a better valu to get the dinner plate which come with some side and is onli a few dollar more  i just didnt want that much food this time so i kept it small

th sandwich was fine  not the greatest but i did enjoy my experi here  i will probabl return and tri the dinner plate at some point as this place seem legit clean and has a full menu  i was torn between 3 and 4 star and be that i wasnt blown away i went with 3 star sinc i i felt that was more realist to my experi there then bump it up to 4  it worth a shot at this place and i realli did like ithave onli tri their muffin here  i was in a rush to get to my gate and they happen to have the shortest line  the servic was veri slow even though there was onli one person in front of mecrazi  the person work there was friend though  the muffin was soso  i was expect much better sinc ive had their cooki at one of their scottsdal locat and they were phenomen  oh well will have to give it anoth shot sometime

return factor  64locat in the deep hood on the southsid near the corner of 7th street  roser in between a liquor store and a recreat center infront of the high school that still hold the record of most student sponsor riot and most confisc gun in the nation nestl in the crossroad of three of the largest gang territori in the state wong to go has been a firm establish in what can be a veri chaotic environ i person love the southsid it tension it color charact and colorless build are beauti to me

open primarili for lunch wong has been open for along as anyon can rememb a serious hole in the wall need to be approach with serious caution  not becaus of it surround but becaus of the curt and often moodi cashier 

wai screech the elder chines woman as she slid the take out window open 

nee hoy sha yinwahma i ask to the amaz of my good friend jacki who has never heard me say a word of chines in her life 

english yes you speak chines she said as her face brighten up 

wahhh hoy shwah idyar indic that i onli spoke a lil bit of chines 

we quick order from their veri limit menu with limitless flavor one order of 4 piec of chicken wing the entir wing btw and a quart of beef fri rice 

stand around in tini park lot talk about whatev i notic how there was a small fridg display differ energi drink and soda and my friend explain how there use to be picnic tabl and even shade for ppl to wait under while their food was be prepar after the riot between rival gang dure which one gang use the tabl as a randez vous point  the citi had ask the wong to take out the tabl she describ to me how there use to be an open window like in fast food place and how after get rob on even  the wong chang their hour to close dure the earli even and now have larg bar over their window 

i realli felt for the wong to put so much into their busi onli to have the tremult neighborhood love them so much and at the same time be the caus of much of their woe just as i was begin to wonder off into oblivion  our order was up and it was gooooood

th chicken was crispi and simpli fri no batter no dredg  noth it was delish as was the beef fri rice that boast sprout and a lil char that jacki request burnt bit are good  yum our entir order was 10 we drove away as a gagl of teenag hungri after their last class walk up to place their order 

to my fellow yelper the southsid is a place that is special to my heart persever rough and color there are place where it can be scari to ventur into but stay on the main road and be a polit driver and you should be alright go and pay the wong a visit but dont be surpris if mrs wong isnt exact a happi camper lol tri the chicken wing theyr greatok it not realli fair to tri to review this place after have just gone to juan authent mexican food on saturday  you see at juan you get 5 star everyth for an amount that you can easili spend here  with that said this del taco has comfort booth seat  the food is passabl  i will say though that the macho combo burrito isnt as good as the one i use to get in la becaus over there they put sour cream on the burrito along with the other thing  mine today didnt have any

along with this burrito i had a small hard taco  a small soft taco  these 39 cent taco arent on the menu here but they have them if you ask  my total was 457  tax but my son spent almost 8  tax for his order of 2 item  a coke here  if he had gotten say a shake instead of a coke his total would have been over 10     o

i think this place eek out 3 star barethis locat is near my work so if i want to get out and grab a quick bite i can do it  ive gone though the drivethru and gone insid to eat  i have never been to a fast food burger place that bring your order to your tabl along with condiment and ask if you need anyth els  that is a veri nice touch  and they are friend and smile  i am a purist and i usual eat my burger plain  yes plain  no lettuc no condiment no noth ive been eat them this way sincewellsinc i start eat burger and that was too long ago caus im old  the burger was fresh the bun was fresh and soft and the fri were crispi on the outsid soft on the insid  i have no compliant  would this be my first choic for a fast food burger  not realli but it decent and they offer chicken option too  it busi at lunchtim both insid and at the drivethru  servic is fast though  i honest dont know how they keep the line at the drive thru move so quick  thank whataburg for be a decent lunch option for mebe 72 i felt my parent trembl a bit when i said i was take them to the farm grow up in the midwest it wasnt rare to hear somebodi bought the farm this did not mean an uncl decid to purchas a ranch but rather met his maker is now six feet under or my favorit hes in a better place now that said my folk were delight at our farm experi it alway a challeng get dad a plain sandwich in ani restaur but they were veri accommod mom and i both enjoy our turkey sandwich and the ice tea is extra good mayb it brew in the sun that would be veri farmlik no now i get the whole theme here with the picnic tabl and all just not a big fan of it myself that and walk on grass ewww but it call the farm and not the citi so no point dock for that realli a uniqu phoenix experi with a gift shop walk trail and the smell of dirt so hitch up your tractor and git on down to the farmmy lunch buddi and i check out mimi on line befor we head over i couldnt decid whether i want breakfast or lunch but eventu decid to allow myself a carbfil lunch 

i order the strawberri lemonad and fri zucchini to start the lemonad was sugari good the zucchini were fresh and hot and we read they were hand bread they came with a side of ranch and a side of marinara they were well like at our table

for lunch i order the pot roast sandwich with fri friend 1 order a salad with fresh fruit and chicken breast with a cup of corn chowder friend 2 had a chicken parm sandwich on ciabatta bread

friend 1s salad came with a fresh bake muffin of her choic she chose carrot cake when all of our food arriv friend 2 order a muffin for fear of steal an unapprov bite of friend 1s muffin

mi food look so good when it arriv i took a big bite of my pot roast sandwich booo so bland no season whatsoev what did they cook their roast in water just plain water after doctor my sandwich with cream horseradish and salt it was passabl the meat was tender and warm but that all it had go for it it came on a thick sourdough bun which was good but i end up take most of the bun off to just eat the meat lettuc and tomato the french fri were crispi and hot and the ranch i dip them in was good im veri picki about my ranch

friend 1s meal was ehok she said the chicken and fruit was suppos to be on the side and not all cube up the corn chowder she got with her meal was tasteless she said she didnt even tast the corn

friend 2s meal was decent he said that he was starv so he just wolf it down but his favorit part was the fri not the sandwich

w suspect due to the older crowd we were surround by that the lack of season and the cube bite of fruit were for their sake 

will we visit mimi again yes there is so much on the menu that it would be foolish to not tri someth els i think ill go for breakfast next timeive been want to tri los taquito even befor i knew it had been on diner drivein and dive and i final got the chanc  the insid it exact what i expect noth fanci booth and some tabl  i found it a littl odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lid napkin condiment and plasticwar are right next to it  if there had been a line it would have been veri awkward  i order a chicken burrito enchilada style with rice and bean and a drink  when i went to get my drink they were out of diet coke it came out as just water  ok i thought mayb they had been super busi as it was about 1pm on a weekday  lunch rush perhap  i took a seat and wait for my number to be call  the burrito was good noth that knock my sock off but a decent burrito  the rice was nice and fluffli but the bean just lack flavor  they were blah  will i come back  sure but i will tri the taco next time and hope that they can rearrang that counter a bitas a non nativ to phoenix this place strike me as one of those restaur  everi citi has at least one  that repres a slice of local flavor and history

denv has casa bonita dont tri and disown it denver you know what im talkin about boston has the oyster hous and other new york has sardi and ani number of other uniqu place  i guess phoenix has rustler roost

they captur the old west the cowboy mytho and gitsch all togeth in one locat and pair it with decent food friend servic and a great view of the city

i wouldnt dine here regular but it is a good place to bring visitor  they definit get pack and there is not enough park on the hill top so you may have a hike if they are realli busigood fri bread  i actual prefer it over the corn muffin that were also in the bread basket  salmon was ok noth to write home about  pricey menu for littl young me who wouldnt be abl to eat enough food to justifi the pricetag  

id say the best thing about this place is the view  the resort has other restaur with bettertast meal so tri the happi hour here but grab lunch and dinner elsewheri was veri excit becaus i had won a gift basket at la noch de yelp elit event in march for rustler roost and thought well my mom is come from washington for a visit in april whi not take her there it would be a 1st time for the both of us sound like a great plan right

mom came into town i told her my plan of take her out to eat so sunday came and we are readi to go  oh let me give you guy a littl insight too my mom had a stroke when she was in her 30s so walk is hard for her 

we got to rustler roost around 425 i never bother to look at what time the place was open but found out they didnt open till 5 i drop mom off at valet park and they were sweet and show mom in through the exit so she didnt have to walk the step so when i park the car the valet told me where my mom went for a slow walker she sure did disappear fast  now it about 435 one of the server saw my mom and told her that when the place open at 5 someon will seat us by the window if that would be ok with her it was close to the exit and she was ok with that

wel 5pm came and noth was happen so i went up to the stair and found the hostess and explain that my mom was handicap and unabl to walk up the stair and where we were told we could wait to be seat she said did you have reserv i said no again didnt think ahead mayb i should i have she said well i have peopl upstair that have been wait for tabl and left   walk back to mom and told her i didnt get veri far    from my impress from the hostess onli way i was go to get a tabl was if i walk upstair to get it for us and this left me with a bad impress that mayb the rr isnt handicap friend like onli those who can get up the stair can have tabl hurray for the walk   my mom who is more even temper then me and is ok with just wait said just be still so i wait anoth ladi show up about 6 min later and ask if we had be help and i said no we havent and she must have been someon import cuz she made it happen   

we were show to our tabl our waitress was jennif veri nice and veri sweet she explain the menu to us sinc it was both our 1st time there we order the cowboy stuff which was bbq rib  chicken crispi shrimp steak  seafood kabob bean veggi potato wedg and some other stuff i have to say the one thing that stood out was the rib omg they are fall off the bone melt in your mouth good rr know how to make some rib go to have to come back from some more of them

i have to say jennif and the nice man at valet park show get custom servic but the hostess left me with a bad impress and she is where the dine experi startive live here for three year and this was my first visit to star of india not sure what took so long other than i had no idea it was here  buri in the back corner of the strip mall in ahwatuke that hous the trader joe i frequent that where i procur my cornbread and my tea tree lavend liquid dish soap among other staples

anyhow i give star of india 35 star the food was great and the dig were what you might expect them to be for an indian restaur buri in the back corner of a strip mall in ahwatuke simpl but clean we didnt come here look for a scene we came in search of fine ethnic eat so the modest decorum was cool by us and the eat were inde fine and ethnic

th staff was friend i do have some advic for our server howev you have a nice smile and were seem help in make suggest from the menu but tri be a littl more reassur onc i settl on someth i have enough uncertainti in my life example

serv how spici do you like your food on a scale of one to ten

m think gee this is nice im use to the onetof scale offer me by most thai restaur there must be a favor exchang rate right now what with the economi and all i like my food mild to medium so let say five

serv are you sure

m ummm  i think so is that consid mild to medium

serv is this your first time eat here

m yes

serv you may want to go easi then

m so  three

serv really

m think dont do this to me i have enough uncertainti in my life i dont know again it my first time eat here so i dont have a baromet by which to measur your one to ten scale what do you suggest

serv five should be good for you

m perplex that what i was origin thinking

serv do four then

m again think dont do this to me i have enough uncertainti in my life let go with that

serv positive

m realli unsur now yes

th aloo parantha was great to start with it like naan onli whole wheat and stuf with potato and green pea tasti my chicken tikka masala was veri good although i will do five next time alexi s had veget korma and they were veri accommod so as to prepar it without nut someth she has grown increas intoler to especi recent sigh lucki me i snuck a tast when she bent down to pick up her napkin it was excel the korma i mean

uncertainti in my life asid one thing im fair certain certain of is that im pretti sure well be go back to star of india i must tri the korma next time and yes im sure i thinkthe tabl across from us dine and dash the restaur is make the server pay that no bueno im not sure if that wasnt a ploy by the server to get sympathi dollar ad to her tip

i normal dont dine at tgi unless im drag kick and scream but the wife was jons for the pretzel and chees on the 12 off appet menu so be a nice guy i said okay let go to tgi friday tonightth pretzel was awesom by the way and i would high recommend it

i like their rib it about the onli thing on the menu that i do like they are meati and delici they have special deal dure sunday footbali total dont get this place  aw hit menu and terribl tooloud top 40 hit play on the stereo system  i was attempt to enjoy dinner with cowork but the environ was just too loud too visual busi and had a similar vibe to the indiana jone ridejungl cruis section of disneyland

to their credit the white sangria thing was fair decent  servic is good and attentthis place is cheesetast to the max

th decor remind me of a place you would find insid a six flag or safari theme adventur daycar or someth there are eleph everywher i get it eleph bar but there a way to do it and there a way to beat a dead eleph into the ground and then run it over with a safari jeep and then wear it as a hat 

mi friend and i had just seen that chimpanze movi in the same complex so we thought we would be clever and come here for a beer i cant report on the food sinc we werent hungri we did check out the menu though and holi crap it huge i realli dislik huge menus it usual a sign of lack of focus it all sort of fusion stuff and if you dont know what fri shrimp or mac n chees look like dont despair there are pictur of everi dish ugh 

it interest that everi inch of this place is cover with safari theme decor but the patio is complet devoid of decor it just a few patio chair and tabl fenc in on the side of the build as an afterthought i guess it was a nice respit from all the eleph and giraff and nonsens 

22 get you three larg beer not includ tip for the nice but complet averag bartend who call me dude 

mehwent here recent with the tour aroundtheworld lunch group that i organ   this was a great lunch  i appreci a restaur that understand that a group can grow   our group doubl in size from the start and our server were more than accommodating

i order 2 thing at this restaur for lunch  i order the haemul pajeon seafood pancak to start  i ate a small piec of it and had it packag to bring home for lunchdinn the next day  a veri tasti pancak with lot of shrimp and squid in it onion and other spice  similar to an okonomyaki that we frequent see in japanes restaurants

for my main portion of the meal i had a bowl of the kimchi chiga  kimchi soup  httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosselectpiisc06bvmh6csrpy7rvhwuseriddhqwshz6b7jsya04m1cia  the yelper that said this was a delici dish were  not mistaken  a veri well season and delici bowl of soup that had nice chuck of pork in it and the veggi  fellow yelper and atw lunch groupi dawn k said she realli enjoy the somewhat fatti meat in the soup  i person enjoy the spici  i would eat this again and i cant wait to have it again

i wasnt veri impress with their banchan select  the side dish just were not as tasti as i would have likearizona onli hipster bar or so the sign says

w discov this place when they start do a tuesday night drumnbass night  the bar is great  dark nice round booth good decor ton of beer on tap even more in bottl great sound system with a stage  theyv got a few pool tabl in a separ littl area so you can still hear the music but still hear your friend  staff is friend courteous and all in all pretti cool

iv eaten here onc for breakfast where they screen movi on a bigscreen use a projector  omelet bloodi mari erin brockovitch ok that part suck ftw

that be said i will prob never eat here again  last night we were chillin wih friend enjoy music and they were enjoy some burger when out of the corner of my eye i see a roach just wake along the top of the booth  cruis around from one side to the other check thing out  

now im not an idiot i realiz there are prob roach everywher but someth psycholog happen when your two feet from a roach in a dine establish  unfortun ill never be abl to eat there again howev i will return for beat and beer  if you read this far you will prob not eat there either but i encourag you to drink there bottlill give this good egg 3 star for standard breakfast food  we came on a veri busi sunday and our food still arriv fast and fresh  mani a chain diner or breakfast place cannot pull that off  ive never realli understood whi that is  breakfast  diner food is short order stuff and should move out of the kitchen quickly

our server border on an attitud when we were seat but quick regain his composur  i guess he was just fluster  i have not ventur beyond breakfast food heresome peopl have said that this place serv the best chines food in the valley  other say it suck  i have an opinion between the two extremes

b from the san francisco bay area i have had a lot of chines food of all qualiti and type  this stuff was pretti mediocr middl of the road stuff  the place realli doe have the look of a 1970s chines joint as has been said by other review  they also have that littl mini grill lit by sterno that they put on the tabl so you can cook meat on a stick or burn it if you are not care  they dont have that back home  

sure id eat there again some time but this place cant compet even with the averag chines restaur in the bay area  you will get a plate of quit edibl food here for your dollar will get good attent servic and will leav fulljust dont expect anyth special in term of tast       this review is for the weekday lunch buffet       

hey hey it a new buffet  ok it been go for a littl while at this julio too locat onli but it was new to robyn n  myself today at lunch time  

this mexican buffet includ 10 main food item includ chimichanga hard shell taco fanci tamal wet burrito with either pork or chicken bean rice  help yourself chip with a varieti of salsa  there were also other goodi avail includ pico de gallo  sour cream

i didnt think the food was to die for or anyth but everyth was good serv at the right temperatur the staff was friend  the restaur clean  comfortable

it a high 3 star for julio too where the fun begin at 1130 am  the cost is 795  ¡ole     we had been want to come to this locat and tri it for quit awhile
too bad we came the night we did becaus we were not impress at all 
food was not hot when it came out our server did not know ani thing about the tea that they carri she had to be ask to refil our drink more than once

it just was not a pleasant experi we so like the one in chandler so much better
i do not think that we will return to this locat mayb it was not a good day for them but now that i have tri it i cannot ever see a reason to returnhave grown up in mesa ive been here mani mani time the last time i was here was 15 year ago when i was in high school tonight i brought my husband and kids

th place liter has not chang in all these year it crazi like a time capsul these lose a star for me becaus of their total antiqu pos system ok it not even that it a manual old school cash regist it cash onli i mean serious also you have order your pizza in one line and get your drink in anoth line and pay separ it make absolut no sense

they also lose a star becaus the pizza is terribl i mean just awful

ok now that the gripe are out of the wayw had a blast my kid were all smile laugh and danc the whole time they were fascin the the huge organ and all the bell and whistl the danc cat the bubbl the light the kid love it the organist was realli good he play a stun version of phantom of the opera that i loved

w got the kid ice cream which was onli 2 each not bad

bottom line the entertain is great the venu is veri casual and super famili friend it a great time with the fam but mayb ill just get a salad next timei have love el pollo loco sinc back in the 1980s  i think there were onli two in the us when i first discov them one on alvarado st in la  mine at the seedi corner of sunset  western in hollywood next to the pussycat x theater  you would drive by  el pollo would look like it was burn down  theyd have the door open  you could see the flame shoot up out of the grill  smoke pour out the door but park somewher home depot  go in  ooh the great chicken  sinc then i have eaten mani mani time at differ locat  just about went nut live in otherwis terrif charlottesvill va for a while where there wasnt an el pollo loco

with this background i stop in with mike c to tri this one  unfortun after have rave epl up to him for month this one was less wonder in some way than usual for this chain  i had fulli expect to give this first one i was tri in arizona 5star as i would for most of the one ive been to in california

first of all the restaur itself was a littl blah  they usual have booth  this one onli had small tabl  chair  then the servic from the girl at the counter was realli weak  some of the shortcom were

  she had taken my name but didnt call us over the pa when our order were up but rather just let them sit there to get cold  she didnt cap the soup either to keep it nice  hot which they usual do

  i had salad for one of my side dish  she didnt offer me ani dress for it  i had to go back  ask

  we both had the tortilla soup but she didnt give either of us the tortilla chip that you add in  i had to go back  ask for them

  she didnt give me a spoon to eat the soup with either  when i went up to ask for one she gave me a teaspoon rather than a soup spoon  hey they have soup spoon ive been eat there for about 30 years

ok so the servic was 1star but epl here still net three  im almost certain the next one i tri here in the valley will be better  i actual went to a bad innout onc too

i didnt write down the price of the combo meal but el pollo loco is veri reason  it fast casual food for fast food price about 5 or 6 for lunchadequ  it fill me up and was conveni to where i was at

i was go to give it two star for meh ive experienc better but the wing were pretti good so i up a star  the wing had a good sauc on them vinegari and spici and they were crispi  they could have been a littl bigger and meatier 

the burger i order was a littl overwhelm in flavor and i actual had to stop eat it befor it was gone  the burger itself was rather small for a restaur burger slight bigger than a patti from innout  the fri were real potato that were nice and crispi but not outstanding

th atmospher was pure chain through and through  the servic was adequ but not exact great

i wouldnt go out of my way to go back but if it was conveni i wouldnt say nowe have been here mani time and everi time realli enjoy it
thi time howev is the rate for our server 
mi girlfriendhav work in mani restaur say this is one of the worst experi ever i have to agree
our server tracywa not have her day at all i dont know if she was mad to be there or she did not feel well or what it was 
 she never brought us the bread basket and when we ask for it she brought it right befor the meal was over it had one roll and one veri small piec of the cake bread they serv if you have been to mimi you know the bread is a big plus 
she never took away the dirti dish and slam the plate on the tabl when she brought them she never even refil our drink the manag was do a drive by and ask if traci was take care of us 
we had to say well we would like more drink please
w were watch the other server give great custom servic as they alway do there we just got the one server that did not want to be there
 custom servic can make or break your experi ani where you go
w were not feel it
 we will go back but make sure never to get this server tracii tri pita jungl for the first time and i am deepli disappoint that i was not greet with 

welcom to the jungle

what a miss opportun seriously

i found the food to be pretti ok not outstand  i had the chicken schwarma aka mediterranean chicken wrap on the menu and it was no schwarma from al hana at biaz market my friend

th chicken was plenti and cube the lettuc was fresh and plenti  the sauc was some kind of garlickytahinihummus tast concoct that was fine  the portion was just fair for the near 8 dollar price tag

mi server valeri was a real treat so i would rate the servic as 4 star even though that doesnt seem to jive with other reviewim dock a star becaus they have remov my favorit item from the menu 

the huevo con tortilla is no longer avail see pic 
whi oh whi would they take that away from me 

im so sad right nowthe food at cyclo is entir overshadow by it outrag owner justina duong  if justina was a gay man she would make a great drag queen  i think shes a hoot but her outlandish behavior and brash comment do not work for everyon  

i have a veri dear friend who live in chandler and she and i would go into cyclo quit often  my friend is marri with three kid but just she and i would go in  she would alway tell justina about her famili and show her pictur of the kid  justina realli get into teas the custom and after a coupl of year she told my friend you crazi faghag  you never bring your famili in here  you just come in with your gay friend  you dont even have a famili  crazi ladi you just carri around those pictur to make your lone self feel better  justina also play up the vietnames accent  she can be offput at first if you dont know what up but the floor show never disappoint if your will to play along

th food is good enough now but it was better when the restaur first open  the star dish includ tom rang hat tieu an appet of shrimp on toast baguett slice with a savori black pepper sauc that is plate lickin good  anoth delici starter is banh xeo  it a crispi rice crepe with shrimp pork sprout and lettuc leav for wrap the crepe slice befor you eat them  for entre ca ri ga is a tasti chicken and pineappl curri and com tam is a mix grill of a marin pork chop beef shrimp and egg over broken rice  as a side dish the dau xanh xao toi is a sublim prepar of spici garlic green bean with chili and sweet soy  

howev the qualiti now vari  the last time i went the pineappl curri was total bland  even though i have eaten at this place mani time i didnt say anyth becaus i didnt want to be bother with justina reaction  instead i havent been back  

i have been into cyclo when justina was not there and the qualiti of the food was nowher near the same in her absenc  my concern is that justina has announc plan yet again to open a second cyclo in the valley  this time it suppos to be on central avenu south of camelback and across from brophi with a fall 2008 open  onc that place open i assum justina will move her floor show to central phoenix and i am left to wonder if the qualiti of the food will continu to slip in chandler

cyclo has a byob polici and some peopl are realli into it  for me it not a huge sell point  i prefer not to schlep my own booz to a restaur but it cool if your into it

if you go to cyclo hope that justina is there  your realli go to cyclo for justina antic rather than the foodwe tri the 13 cours tast menu with extend wine select the servic was wonder and 100 spot on

th food howev was quit a let down some dish realli excel in their tast and present while mani were just a puzzl question mark follow by a mediocr tast 

a few memori includ a shot of squeez juic which is consid a cours which is more suit as a canap 

a salad which includ a few leaf of lettuc with two small sliver of chees i appreci the craftsmanship of the 30 year old chees but it in no way compliment the lettuc and left you wonder whi it wasnt pair with someth more suitabl or to paraphras enjoyable

out of the 13 cours there were 3 or 4 that realli shine the buffalo be one of these 

when you averag in the odd interior decor it appar that attent has not been paid to all the detail and that what a fine dine experi realli should includ if your aim for multimichelin star experi detail detail detail 

on anoth high note the wine pair were absolut wonder and the sommeli was both inform and wonder in not onli introduc each pair but be abl to provid excel altern when pair didnt go quit well

th card which gave us a list of all the cours  pair was a nice touch at the end

for arizona this is a step up in experi and im happi to see restaur of such calib realli offer altern to place such as binkleys

it worth tri but for us there werent mani dish wed be crave on a return visit for 

after read other review it may be an issu that kai has invest a good amount of time in perfect the smaller tast menus and main entre but struggl to fill the larger 13 plate experithe first thing you will notic about this review is that im give the highest rate restaur in arizona a 35 this place is the onli 5 diamond restaur in arizona that a pretti heavi distinct to live up to i cant say they didnt live up to it but i cant say woohoo about my visit either

i want to point out that this place has what i can onli imagin is a true 5 diamond experi down to a well orchestr and choreograph scienc the menus came with a stori  as did the food and everyth we consum it was a littl heavyhand handpaint menus and live pan flute music play in the background along with a waiternarratorstori teller come to our tabl everi few minut to be our person wikipedia for the evening

th food was good but this is one of those place that has tini portion present on big plate most cours were mere bites morsel mani were complimentari as some of us order item with more cours than other i wouldnt ever again go out of my way for the food here noth spoke to me in fact i dont realli rememb much of what i ate i know i had a steak at one point a bonein ribey that had quit a bit of gristl 

the servic was incred it was over the top that was the biggest problem here realli there were four of us dine and they kept refer to us by our last name  mr and mrs so and so and mr and miss such and such and what her face it was offput enough to all of us that we request they knock it off everi time they brought out a drink or a cours there was a brigad of waiter carri shit six peopl serv four it was too much 

i guess im just not the type of person who need that much pamper it make me feel uncomfort mayb i need to seek therapi for it  theyll tell me i dont love myself enough and make me cri about my dad becaus i dont feel like i deserv that kind of servic but serious it overkil 

this is the sort of think that peopl with too much money and not enough selfesteem need to do to feel power and import ive heard that sometim rich billionair oil baron just shit in the bed instead of go to the bathroom and they have peopl who clean up after them they appar keep these habit when they stay at hotel sometim as well 

it just all remind me of the gap between the superrich and the rest of us the elimin of the middl class 

the whole thing is overpr if your not all about everi bit of it you have to like the pamper the stori the food and the special import drink if you appreci all of that then you will enjoy yourself most of it just made me feel like a pretenti asshole

for me im happi if you dont spit on my food make sure i have my refil on my drink and that you dont seat me next to the bathroom the food is whi i go out to eat  not to have someon serv or entertain me the food here just wasnt strong enough on it own
 to warrant a return

i will say this though  the view is amaz and the place is beauti tranquil and classii have a loveh relationship with jasons

i love that
they have a huge menu of sandwich salad soup pasta etc
they have bake potato bigger than my head
their simpl but perfect salad bar
th ginger bread muffin at the salad bar  1 reason alon to go
th assort of wrap cracker at the salad bar
everyth  look so good and is so big
they alway have some new special when i go in
if you have room after lunch you can help your self to a soft serv ice cream cone

i hate that
they are alway pack like sardines
they arent veri clean
they serv a pile of greasi broken ruffl with the sandwiches
th tuna isnt good
ther is bare room to walk between the tables
th sandwich arent ever as good as i want them to be but are ok nonetheless see pics

a ami b said the space is on the small side and seat is limited

a hand down winner over ihop denni or ani other chain dinereh the food is okay  i realli like their carnita and their cilantro lime rice  the black bean were pretti damn flavorless though  i think for what you get it a bit too pricey  about a buck and a half too much in fact

and for god sake whi the hell doe everi chipotl have to be so deafen  did the architect that design chipotl not consid acoust when they design the place  

mi lunch was fine when i start eat at 11 am but by the time i was leav and the lunch crowd had filter in the din of nois was like be verbal assault while underneath a tin pail in a hail storm  there are no nois baffl anywher and the corrug tin wall and booth and concret floor make the place uncomfort loud    this is not the first time i have notic this in a chipotl locat either  they are all like this

i tri not to visit chain restaur as much as possibl but when mom text that she could meet me somewher for a bite to eat it was much easier to tell her to meet me at the cheesecak factori at the mall than it was to give her direct to tri a local place in downtown phoenix or elsewher  believ me ive tried

sinc we were there dure happi hour we decid to share the spici ahi tuna tempura roll and she want the hh caesar salad  the ahi tuna roll and the salad came out fair quick and no wonder sinc the roll onli consist of four tini piec  we were hungri and the piec were so diminut that i didnt even get a chanc to take a photo of the dish  it was veri tasti but certain not substanti so i took anoth look at the hh menu and settl on the hummus  while wait for it to arriv mom and i share the nicelys caesar salad which was crispfresh and not overlydress  

we decid to hold off on the salad for awhil so as not to fill ourselv up on it  the hummus and grill pita bread arrivedl and they too were flavor we couldnt get enough  while we normal wouldv stuck w the happi hour menu mom had caught sight of a neighbor tabl two platter and admir one of them so i decid to order not the one she thought look appet the menu descript turn her off but what i had origin want to order instead of the hummus plate a chicken pasta dish from the season menu  two chicken breast pound thin batter then fri sit atop of spaghetti w a basilpesto cream sauc  on top of the chicken were slice of prosciutto and dress arugula green sprinkl w grate parmesan  this dish tast fabul and the differ textur it offer made me swoon  i knew mom enjoy it as well for she repeat at least two time how great the food was  howev i knew that the greasi of this dish would haunt me after  still a great savori dish and next time ill just skip the happi hour menu save the caesar salad that a must and order from the dinner menu instead

great servic as alway although i just rememb that the honey wheat bread i had ask for arriv stale  funni that the server had even bother to serv it as she did warn us that it wasnt as fresh as it could be and that a new batch was bake in the oven  whi even bring stale harden bread to the tabl  it the reason whi i downgrad from the previous fourstar rate to a threeit not that i dont like burger i just need to be in the mood for a burger last night when i went to red robin i wasnt whi the hell did you go to red robin you say i had a leftov gift card to use ok 

so i went with a veggi burger prepar like one of their 
signatur burger it had melt chees bourbon sauc and onion straw of cours it came with fri i didnt finish the veggi burger and it didnt sit well with me oh well good tri 

the servic was outstand and garner a nice tip by the way 

so for this visit 2 star i did have a burger here sever month ago and it was pretti good 3 star for that visit52010

it has been year sinc i first tri the roast sweet potato fig confit mozz arugula tomato fennel sweet potato and balsam vinaigrett on herb foccacia here 2003 so i decid to have it again sinc last have it in sedona a few year ago  it wasnt a fave wbc item of mine in 03 it was all about the lemonricotta pancak for me then and still now although i havent had ani sinc sedona and that bec it rare for me to make my way to wbc on the weekend when breakfast is serv till 2p and befor 1030a on the weekday but i realli am a fan of it now  even if you arent a vegetarian as long as you like your veggi you would find someth youll like in this sandwich  wbc is also will to custom most item for you omit certain veggi and sub other if need be  this sandwich was veri fill and i could easili have squeez two meal out of the serv  i didnt

w have been here befor and had realli good food and realli good servic 
not last night 
we came here for dinneri was veri tire after a long day of work i just want ice tea no alcoholwhich i veri rare drink anyway t went to wash her hand and ask me to order her a hot water with lemon
when our server sareena came over and i gave her the drink order she seem mif we did not want alcohol she kept say you dont want ani cocktails

i got the fish taco and they were quit good made with mahi

howev sareena never pick up ani dish from our tabl or trash the manag did a drive by and she clean up the tabl for us
even the tabl behind usyel out to her hey can we get some bread
i do not agre with that but clear she did not know the proceedure
when t ask for more hot watera she was not offer ani  our server onc again brought out the cup by the top and when she put it down she actual ran her finger over the lip one more time for good measur it has a handlewhi are you finger the cup 
of cours t was freak outbecaus she is such a germ aphob anyway
but even i do not understand whi you would serv a glass or cup like that

w have alway had good servic at cpk but not last night howev the food was veri goodonc upon a time fleme was the place culinari dream are made of but ala thing are a changin 

the last coupl time ive visit i was increas unimpress 
just last week i took my husband for his birthday dinner as we do everi year boy what a let down 

let start with the raggedi famili wear their beani and harley davidson basebal cap that was seat right in front of me 

hello dress codemannersanyon 
whi did i bother dress to the nine i could have worn  my pajama and nobodi would have care 

that right there just made me feel i might as well have went to black angus 

now for the waiter who lack the experi and train to be serv in a fine dine establish 

he was horribl 
unprofession inattent and careless to sum it up he was so interest in my nation that he had to ask me my heritag then made a point to refer someth greek each time he return to the tableso annoy 

not to mention bring me dirti water and wine glass even the littl wine decant they bring your wine in was dirti 

now for my salad i alway order the fresh mozzarella and tomato salad this time it was appar they improvis the mozzarella was not near the qualiti it usual is and instead of sweet slice tomato and fresh basil it came with chop grape tomato on top of shave cucumb see pic 

i realli should have complain but be the hubbi birthday i want to spare him the scene 

for my entre i decid on the chef mix grill petit fillet tempura shrimp and sear scallop although as alway i ask to replac the steak with an extra shrimp and scallop as i dont eat beef 

i got a plate of six giant scallop and three shrivel shrimp 
i had to send it back becaus i was told i was get tempura shrimp and these shrimp were not 

they return it to me quick but still was overkil on the scallop see pic in the pic you cant see the other side of the plate had 3 more scallop i would have like anoth shrimp instead 

mi hubbi steak was perfect for him but he too was veri disappoint in all the thing ive state abov 

now for the biggest let down of all 
normal for special occas they will bring out their signatur creme brule and chantilli cream with a candl 

not ani more boo 

we got a cheesi littl gold box with four tini crappi chocol cover strawberriesnot a fan 

after this experi im sorri to say that we will not be go back ever again they are lucki to be get these three star090110

mi first and so far onli visit to fleme  i give it 25 stars

first thing i notic was that it was veri dark insid a pet peev of mine  second the servic look either harri or aloof  where were the smile face  it was 415 pm which meant the door had just open 15 minut ago and there werent mani guest yet wait to be seat  there were about eight peopl at the bar area  i soon met my server whose cold gaze and unsmil face alreadi had me think mayb this place was not such a good idea  

after studi the menu i decid id tri the prime burger for 6 i also ask if i could sampl a coupl of red wine befor order a glass of one  ive been to mani venu where this is not a problem and sometim when i cant decid even will offer  this fleme locat isnt one of these venu  my queri brought about a more negat chang of attitud from my server but i did get to tri two veri small sampl befor choos a glass

whil i wait for the burger to arriv i began to boot up my laptop thank good i brought it bec the burger took a long time  the bar area was fill up fast and the server start to look even more agit that i was start to wonder what was all the fuss  final just under 20 minut later my beauti burger arriv  huge patti smother w chees and top w thickcut pepper and smoke bacon tomato onion lettuc and a pretzel bun  the one huge onion ring was a nice touch  the burger was juici cook to my specifi medium quit substanti and delici w the cheddar veggi and bun  the thickcut bacon howev was so salti that i had to take the slice off  i was a bit disappoint sinc it was such a hearti portion of bacon

i wouldnt mind have anoth prime burger minus the bacon for happi hour again but id choos anoth locat 

btw as i was enjoy the burger i final figur out whi all the harri face and the server hustl and bustl it seem like everyon in the bar area had chosen the burger  the tabl of six in front of me all had burger at 6 it a steal for diner but perhap not expens enough to garner a nice tip  hmm well not if the server attitud continu to be cold and distantafter anxious wait sever week to tri this restaur i was not that impress with meal 3935 for two peopl for breakfastholi cow we ordered
 bacon pancakes
 liberti potatoes
 side of eggs
 side of sausage
 griddl bread pudding
 kir royal 

pros
 appreci the abil to order my food befor sit down
 you can see the chef prepar the food in the open
 bacon pancak were awesom load with plenti pig 
 liberti potato were well season and on point
 sausag was accept not too salti which i prefer

cons
 major attitud was given when i polit advis that my glass had appar lipstick of sort and not from my lip the person tend the e61 bar suggest that it wasnt  i dont give a damn what it is my glass is appar dirti the manag was not all that pleas that i brought it up either but so what i just paid 40 and expect stellar servic and clean tableware
 potato egg and sausag were brought out sever min befor the main dishuh i prefer my entir meal at onc and not in cours 
 griddl bread pud was a bit soggi for my like 
 kir royal immedi gave me a headach clear sign of cheap alcohol
 the line was a tad bit long to place an order i would expect if your stand in line to order and pay that it would move along much quicker than 25 mins

whil the menu had sever item i would love to tri it will be quit a while befor i revisit i never place a dollar amount on a good meal howev i do prefer to get what i pay for this was not a 40 breakfasti come here everi year with my famili for the pumpkin chili festiv they have for halloween this is a great place to take your younger kid and have a great famili daynight not onli do you have a lot of farm like stuff to do hay ride pig race pet zoo they also have a ton of fun stuff for halloween like the spooki train ride face paint corn maze and more you have to keep in mind that this is a famili own farm and doesnt have a lot of fund so the ride are worn down sometim break the food is mediocr and it a bit ran down but that is the whole point if you are expect realli cool ride fanci dish and to stay clean your go to the wrong place it all about simpl easi thing cute littl ride for the kid lot of dirt and have a good time there are all kind of activ for the whole famili just make sure to bring cash all the littl placesshopssnackfood onli take cash

th onli complaint i have this year is how un friend the staff was usual the farm has great friend employeesvolunt but this year there were a lot of upset cranki rude worker make sure each person visit knew they work for tip aw atmospher this year hope it get better next year

great layout like usual kid had a blast fun time thank schnepf farmmikado realli surpris me  i didnt expect to find a japanes restaur so close to home with a nice atmospher and pretti good foodbut here it is 

sushi is realli the thing here  the tempura is good although the shrimp tempura had an odd coat that didnt match the veggi and it didnt seem like authent tempura  miso soup is pretti good too

but go for the sushi  theyr all about the sushi here3 star for the food 5 star for the uniqu experience

i stop by this mcdonald locat for a quick lunch one day and order 2 doubl cheeseburg and larg fri  while i was wait for my food someon told me about a free car show they host in the park lot everi saturday night

mi food was readi and i had a decent lunch  it mcdonald so my expect are pretti low  not bad for a quick meal

i then return the next saturday night to check out the car showit was pretti cool  there are probabl close to 100 car hereeveryth from old classic chevi corvett camaro mustang to newer rice rocket acura honda toyota to exot ferrari lambo  i was amaz  best partit free

bi the wayth mcdonald was pack and make ton of moneygreat idea

return factor  100 the car show was a lot of fun will definit be backso i realli fought come here becaus it alway look like a hole in the wall to me 
mi mom love come here but then again she love wildfish so i said what the hell she chose this place for here bday 

we got there at 530 right when it open so we were instant seat 

it was happi hour and they had the basic roll half off we order the spici tuna and the tootsi roll 

the tootsi roll was not the normal salmon cream chees schpeal it normal is it was just cali roll with shrimp tempura 

i would give the spici tuna roll 3 star it get 3 and not 2 onli becaus it wasnt fishi 
it was just rice and heavili mayod tuna with no spice 
they should have ad a littl green onion put half as much mayo and mayb ad a littl cucumb for crunch 

the tootsi roll is imposs to f up there so it was good for what it was 

we also order one of the speacialti roll the yellow tail tempura it was ok again 3 star onli that high becaus no bad fish flavor 

it seem the qualiti and care for the fish is there but the sushi chef destroy all the roll with too much mayo or krab they should invest in a few new chef or train or someth even the shape was off it seem this guy was straight out of school mayb it was  just the guy who happen to be there that night

i would go back but onli if i was meet someon thereincred odd layout to this place  i need a few minut and a rosetta stone to figur out whi there need to be segreg dine  still a mysteri  
the food is pretti good  i echo the overal sentiment about the authent  but theyv done a decent job of meld the upper east side with the southwest one thing they should have left on manhattan is that nyc attitud  becaus custom servic matter in the rest of the worldi am annoy 

let me be clear ive purchas dozen of bagel from this chompi and theyr alway good big fluffi with a littl exterior crunch the order process is simpl and quick and the price is low

yet i am annoy i came in this late morn for a breakfast sammich i order an everyth bagel toast with a fri egg and sausag i dont get down with the chees i get my sammich home and open it up and am immedi annoy henc whi im annoy 

i will attach a photo but allow me to describ the bagel is burnt on the insid edg like black the egg is overcook not hot and runni like it should be and the sausag is liter the size of a silver dollar it bare cover half the bagel i mean come on i ate most of it but it was dri with no salt or pepper or ani season besid the bagel itself the sausag tast like noth so annoy 

i will continu to buy bagel from chompi but i will never order anyth els 

and some old ladi cut me in line after hover over my shoulder for five minut back off ladi grrrin my effort to live and love local i tri to show basha some love sinc they are a local own chain everyth about this basha is just ok the produc inventori and servic are all par but noth stand out i recent bought sever bake good from this basha for an event i was on the hunt for sugar cooki that santa littl elv could decor dure a shop crawl they didnt have ani out so i ask the ladi behind the counter she told me they had cooki in the back for a dollar a piec this was too high for my budget so i polit declin then a coupl minut later she came back and told me they were actual on sale and onli 50 so i decid to buy them coincid that i said no to cooki for a 1 and then they becam 50 cent or just oversight by the employe who know 

dure my visit i also purchas some donut i need two dozen donut and unfortun they dont have donut by the dozen premad so i end up make my own while this is good becaus you can choos your own i think it would also be help to have premad dozen for those in a huge hurri like i was that day 

in summari this basha is just ok but i love support local so i will continu to shop herewas in the mood for breakfast at lunchtim so i drop by this locat  i was abl to find a tabl pretti quick  i had my mind made up on what i wanteda veggi omelet tomato mushroom bell pepper onion wsourdough toast and hash browns
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosjfhfvtt8xnjtwqsdraiwselectm3ssxbas8dcfylaa6qww

th food came out fast and i was surpris to see larg slice of tomato on top of the omelet instead of chop up insidethi was the first time ive ever had a veggi omelet like thatturn out i like it this way  the omelet was cook well not runnywhich is a good thing  the onli thing i didnt like about the omelet was the mushroomsthey were definit can and not cut freshoth than that it was a solid omelet

th hash brown were ok and the sourdough toast was veri goodshould have ask for it dri but forgot to do that  i like my toast dry

overal it was a nice breakfast dure lunch

return factor  70pretti consist averag sushi and hibachi experi or in other word eh

iv been more to the sushi side of the restaur and sat both at the tabl and the sushi bar ive also done hibachi on sever occas  the servic is just ok  i kind of consid benihana to be like the fast food chain version of sushi

i was there over the weekend and had a fli in my water other than that the food was fine but it still end up be 25  35 per person depend on how hungri you are

im sure ill be back when i am crave sushi and dont feel like deal with a wait or care much about atmospher  howev im not rush eitheri think it had been a solid 5 month sinc my last visit to benihana and i still stand by my 3 star review  it was just as i rememb  same waitress and all  i took my bfs sister for dinner there on a sunday night  we each order a benihana salad i do love that dress and a miso soup  i think they gave us a differ kind of soup but we ate it anyways

w share a las vega roll a spici tuna roll and then each had our own select of nigiri i had ikura and she had eel and handrol i had spici scallop and she had eel  it was all edibl but not spectacular  i recommend against order the las vega roll  it has way too much cream chees and sauc on it  other than that go to benihana for a quick sushi dinner that is decent qualiti and price for sushi but no atmospher  dont say i didnt warn youhad lunch at zinc for the first time recent right as they were open  consid they were not yet busi we had pretti mediocr servic  to begin with we were not offer bread  sinc it was our first visit i wouldnt have necessarili assum we would get bread but i notic other tabl had it so natur i felt slight  and then the cardin sin of serv  i was mayb 25 through my meal when our server appear with our check and ask if we would like dessert  well i dont know  i havent realli eaten yet  my husband wasnt even finish and he eat like hes still in the militari  needless to say i just took the check and shortchang her tip in return for shortchang the time i was appar allot for eat 

as for the food  i had the macaroni au gratin with smoke ham as well as their up sell of parmesan truffl fri  i like the mac and chees  not the best ive had but pretti good  the fri were okay  but ive never understood the concept of dress up plain ole french fri and serv them with ketchup  if im not go to get a nice aioli or some other special dip sauc id rather just have the fri san all the other crap

i wouldnt necessarili object to a return visit if im in the area but i wont be break down their door  just as well i doubt they would carei dont realli like cheesecak factori they have an amaz caesar salad but other than that i dont like anything

their strawberri shortcak is made with biscuit what is that all about way to ruin strawberries

i do have to agre with lorena that it is great for group and the server are usual pretti awesomive experienc better but for an outtaway bar it okay i would return 

now this place is half restaur half otb off track bet salon with quit a few local famili for dinner and a few diehard track bet happen at the bar on the farside

now im a bar rat i enjoy sit at the bar talk with the staff and meet the regular but i may of hit an off night and i like to have dinner at the bar if i can i am comfort here but they have too mani bar stool cram togeth to maneuv on and off in and out

th even i was here they had a trashcan fire out on the front stoop possibl from the mani discard lose bet ticket thrown about but most just from a careless smoker

our two bartend werent on the same page i order a round of drink and the next round was a complet differ price wasnt pleas and in ask was kinda frown down upon enough that it was time to leav and tri friendlier jointbought by corpor landri and the camelback locat close this former steak giant is head south and fast

what do you think about when you think mortons
strang tan vinyl booth yes ive seen them in chicago and i final get it
sinatra standards
bow ties
to be shown what a beefsteak tomato look like from the cart
to be shown what a life lobster look like the poor kiddo
to be shown what a porterhous look like oh yum
crabcakes
and the best darn steak you can get in town no matter the cut
dont forget the sprig of watercress my favorite

but landri isnt have it a multimillion dollar brand is take a new direction
no more sinatra
no more cart
maitr has no tux
limit champagn option 160 tatt is a plain ripoff

steakhous are a dimeadozen these day and with eddi vs nearbi put on the ritz with live jazz and magnum of the heitz martha vineyard besid great steak landri morton wont be here for longthis place has good bagel but tepid servic i get bagel to go and the last time i was there the kid make the bagel had no food servic glove on and was take money make bagel etc not the end of the world but it doe kind of junk you out anoth odd thing is that when you like your bagel doubl toast for some reason they put so much butter on it almost like the bagel is deep fri i havent been back sinc the kid had poor food hygien practic but i need to get back therethere are a lot of good mexican food spot here in az so much so that you realli have to do someth great or uniqu in order to stand out from the crowd of other mexican restaur ajo al is good but it isnt quit good enough to leav a last impress or warrant return visit 

first off i have to give the place high mark for their décor the place has a fun western feel vibe the booth all have strip of cow hide and are adorn with old time western movi poster among other thing i could see this be tacki in certain circumst but it work here the tortilla chip came out nice and warm and the salsa was flavor definit not bad to munch on while wait for the main dish to arriv we tri the taco del mar plate fish taco and a combin platter which includ a taco green chile tamal and a chile relleno everyth was pretti good but as i mention abov it just didnt have that wow factor it was just one of those meal that met expect but didnt go abov and beyond in ani way the same could be said about the servic it was passabl but not anyth abov averag id be happi come here again if the circumst were right i just feel like the food need a bit more pizzazz and mayb some more distinct flavorsdish to set them apart from the crowd for exampl mayb they could have some chef special that you couldnt find anywher els rather than have the major of their menu taken up with the usual suspect tacostostada etc while theyr good reliabl mexican dish itd be nice to have more adventur option like some of the higher end mexican spot offer 

alo al is definit worth tri at least onc i just wouldnt expect anyth too differ than the usual mexican stapl theyd be on to someth if their menu was as fun as the décorhappi 25 year anniversari ajo als

y it a local chain with four valley locat and this is one of the two locat ive actual been to but it famili own and oper and still go strong after 25 year  there someth to be said for that

it not at the top of my list but ive never been disappoint by ajo al  i go mayb onc or twice a year for lunch or dinner  when i recent had a crave for mexican food i suggest this place to my friend and they glad met me here  

our waiter was attent the atmospher is fine the chip and salsa are addict and the food is aok  portion are larg  i had a burrito enchilada style per the waiter suggest and a salad and took half of my meal home  my friend went with a burrito and a quesadilla respect  none of us ooh or aaah over the food but we ate it and it was fine  price are moder  oh and my leftov were just as good the next day for lunch

on weird thing on their menu they list sever item with guacamol but it funni everi time that guacamol is list they put meatless by it  has anyon ever had guacamol that is not meatless  i found that realli awkward

anyway if your in the mood for tradit mexican food you cant go wrong with ajo al  im sure ill end up there again in anoth six month or sobefor i delv into my person experi at hiro i will discuss the import factor of what make a good sushi restaur accord to my criteria 

for credibl ive eaten sushi my entir life everywher from cali to vega to thailand i believ i can distinguish between the differ level of qualiti in regard to sushi grade fish 

 fish qualiti 
   i order the dinner sashimi platter 21 2 order of the spanish macker nigiri11 1 order of the giant clam nigiri 11 
             the sashimi was averag and the tuna had a distinct fishi smell to it the portion were of averag size and the layout was aesthet pleas the spanish macker was out of this world good i high recommend it albeit the cut are small the fish is delici the giant clam was overpr base on it size and fresh 

 rice quality
    this is pretti hard to mess up the rice is perfect balanc as it should be the fish to rice ratio was good 

i went into this restaur with high expect first from the high review on yelp and second upon enter the restaur you are overwhelm by an abund of japanes celebr pictur plaster all throughout the entranc they are all somehow affili with the restaurantown the pictur suggest that these japanes celebr have eaten at this restaur and give their thumb of approv 

3 star becaus this restaur in regard to nigiri and sashimi were just averag the problem with sushi review on yelp is that you get a lot of review talk about roll and sake bomber it sad but true that so mani peopl will judg a restaur base on how good their roll are when the true judgment of a sushi restaur should be in the qualiti of their fish 

the sushi review on this restaur and other here in phoenix are skew becaus restaur accommod too much to their target audienc and unfortun their target audienc doe not includ me 

the phoenix sushi market is tailor toward the noobi of sushi this trend in phoenix has led to inaccur review of restaurants

who care about how much mayonnais sriracha imit crab and fri stuff a place can put in a roll let talk about the good stuff the stuff that peopl crave 

i have given up on sushi in phoenix from now on i will get my sushi fix from cali vega or seattl you cant go wrong with these place the sushi is tailor toward sashimi connoisseur and true sushi fanat 

it unfortun but phoenix is a noob citi when it come to sushieven though i live relat close to this taco bell i rare come here  had a coupl of meal here recent and got my favs

7 layer burrito 229
2 bean burrito 198

the restaur is kept clean and unless it the lunch rush it alway fast  nice cheap option when your hungri and on the run

return factor  60a friend of mine invit us to dinner here  it been a while sinc weve been to macaroni grill  we use to eat at a macaroni grill for lunch all the time but in recent year have ignor it

i have a favorit dishth pasta milano roast chicken sundri tomato mushroom farfall pasta in a roast garlic cream sauc 1199but i got it without chicken sinc im on a no meat diet

th better half order the crust sole filet of sole top wlemon butter  serv wsundri tomato spinach orzo 1499

i didnt like my pasta milanoth cream sauc was veri wateri and didnt have much flavorbland which has never happen to me when ive order it

th better half enjoy her sole but didnt think it was anyth beyond average

mi friend order the king salmon 1799 and enjoy it

if i was rate this dinner on my experi alon it would have been 2 starsbut sinc the other two dine with me enjoy their meal im bump it up to 3  the servic was sosoyoung wait staff here with plenti to learn about servicei didnt ding them becaus of their inexperi  they were pleasant and sincerewhich goe a long way with me

return factor  30back in the east coast i enjoy romano macaroni grill becaus of the good food in larg portion casual set and gracious and fast servic  dure the uye i attend here with fellow yelper rand mike robyn georgi arlin and masha i found the set to be just as casual the person who serv us was courteous and friend but it seem that she was swamp at the time we were there we came in at open time and there were quit a number of tabl she had to attend to simultan and though she was veri busi she tri veri hard to accommod everyon perhap the restaur should have more staff around at that time as for the food the portion were not as larg as i was accustom to from back east but suffici and it was tastithought we would tri a new breakfast place and after check yelp near our hous jp pancak pop up  we saw more negat than posit review so initi pass howev our normal place was realli busi so thought it would be fun to tri someth new  went into it with low expect and have to say was pleasant surpris  

decor is fun simpl and feel veri famili own which is a good thing  waitress good custom servic recommend we tri the oven bake pancak  we had our kid with us so she kind let us know it take 20 minut to bake  if you are in a rush or have crazi kid with you as we did make sure you order the bake pancak as soon as you arriv  we went with the appl pancak and they were realli good

w would have given jp pancak a 4 star due to the appl bake pancak howev some of the other menu item we tri were not as good  the home fri were fine just a littl too oili and need season  my kid had a gallon of syrup just becaus they like to make their parent super nut when hop up on sugar with a side of pancak sausag and bacon  they said they like it so that is good as they are somewhat breakfast snob  the kid menu had good choic and price were fair 3order

if you are up for tri a uniqu bake pancak experi give jps a trilook for a quick casual place for a bagel and coffe  this could be your place  just know go in that it no frill it exact that a quick casual place for a bagel muffin coffe or sandwich  the menu is pretti limit beyond those things

lsb is a fastcasu concept where you order at the counter and pay and then sit down and they bring you your food  i met a friend here recent for sunday breakfast  i had my husband in tow and she had two kid  we had a decent experi but it definit didnt blow me away

mi friend went with a bagel and lox plate i assum this is their signatur dish  i had a bagel and egg sandwich jare had a coupl of bagel and the kid had a bagel and a larg cooki  the food was just ok  i have to say i like the bagel better elsewher in the valley and even in detroit  i know not to compar to ny or my rate would be even lower  

posit reason for come here are that they are super quick they offer indoor and outdoor seat friend servic and a lego tabl where the littl one can play  park is easi as wellhidden in the shop center just north of via de ventura on the west side of hayden is buster  buster along with a chipotl a flower shop and some other busi that i hope to make a better mental note of next visit 

i could easili have gone along with my life and not notic buster although i drive by the area all of the time  but when my friend allyson suggest it as a central spot for a few girlfriend to meet for dinner one tuesday night i went along with the plan  im alway up for tri some place new

bust offer tradit bar food along with some seafood steak and specialti item  we chose to sit in the bar although none of us partook in their happi hour which goe until 7  asid from the waitstaff we were the youngest peopl in the place by a decad or two

noth realli stood out and the food was fine  not amaz  not bad  just fine  i had a greek salad with chicken and my two friend each order 12 portion of the lavosh pizza and side salad  they seem happier with their order than i was  i will point out that the lavosh pizza do not come with ani kind of sauc on them but marinara is avail for dip upon request

th bill was under 20 a person out the door but then again we didnt order much  i wouldnt choos buster as a goto place again but i wouldnt be oppos to give it anoth shot sometim either  

ps  i didnt notic the musti and damp carpet smell mayb they replac it natali22813

redeem a coupl of free fish taco coupon i was given at the yelp event held here a coupl of year ago   was told they were for the alaskan pollock the same one we were given at the parti  while i wait for these to be prepar i realiz i dont like the atmospher indoor as it felt too fastfoodish for me and yes i realiz that i am write a review on rubio i guess dine al fresco is the way to go when your here  should i ever go back i will choos outdoor dine or just go for takeout and head to a nearbi bar with a better select of beer and wine and better atmospher as well

oh and i like the beerbatt pollock with the green and signatur white sauc on flour tortilla  just wish each taco came with more than just the one lime wedg i need more acid to cut through the grease

i it gourmet no

i it high qualiti no

it fast food and the order was correcttummi full mission accomplished

return factor  60i hang out on restaur patio as much as possibl this time of year this place has a huge cover patio which is alway a plus in az the restaur is locat in a high traffic area but i realli didnt hear ani of the nois from the traffic 

i came here for happi hour and it was busi they have lot of high top outsid but they quick fill up if you come around five oclock the crowd dwindl down outsid by about 6630 pm which is great if you want to sit on the patio and take advantag of their happi hour  they have discount on drink and app are 25 off from 37 pm  monfri they also have other drink special that chang everyday

it start get a littl chilli onc the sun set but they start a fire in the outdoor fireplac which was surround by some pretti comfort chair and a love seat anoth plus didnt tri ani food but the menu look pretti good standard american food and the price look reason look like a great lunch spot ill have to come back and have someth to eat next timeive been here to eat befor but not in some time  i swung by here after the hors show on saturday with john c as we were starv and he had want an alcohol beverag i figur it was time to stop in and eat here sinc it been a while for me

thi place has a decent menu with a varieti of menu item and a full bar of drink to choos from  we were in here on a saturday around 5ish and there was hard anyon in the placejust a famili sit kitti corner to us and mayb one or two parton in the bar  kinda dead for a saturday in my opinion

servic here was good and john c had a bloodi mari and some quesadia i went with the slider appit and we both went with sweet potato fri  alcohol price were reason but the place was darn near empty

anyway i got my k odonnel fix for now and im glad i went  left feel full and had some tasti sweet potato fri in the mean timeim take my rate down from 5 to 3 star becaus k odonnel food has been inconsist the last coupl of time i have been there

 i was realli disappoint with the forgetaboutit pizza this past weekend it look to me that the cook forgot to put italian sausag on the pizza the artichok was cut in fourth instead of in tinier slice to be spread upon the pizza yes i complain to the server but she explain to me that the ingredi are measur out i think that the cook was sloppi and lazi and sent me an inferior product the server who was new had no concept of what this pizza should look like in fact i didnt see ani of the old timer server in the din room when i was there they would have rectifi the situation

 i dont know whi manag didnt show up they would have immedi known that the pizza was just not right ive been go to k os about onc everi 10 day i am definit cut back on my patronagya know how peopl say i realli want to like this place or i want to like this place more than i do it such a stupid thing to say becaus obvious you want to like a place you dont go somewher and say i realli want to hate spend my money here and eat their food 

well anyway rant asid i do actual want to like this place and i come here pretti regular but the servic is so annoy my work buddi and i like to come in after work for a few beer and some food the food is pretti good i love their spici thai hummus and the beer are obvious great the patio is comfort with heater in the winter as well but the servic just irk the crap out of me the girl usual are swamp no matter how mani peopl are there most of the time we dont even know who our server actual is becaus two or three peopl come over and take our order sometim the first girl leav and trade us off to someon new or the girl just flat out disappears

most of the time our drink sit empti until someon final see us and take anoth order other time our drink arent even halfway empti and theyr tri to get us anoth round 

theyr friend and nice but be nice isnt realli the onli way to do thing meh mayb im too critic but i shouldnt have to ask the food runner for plate napkin and silverwar or glass of water like three or four time 

ill keep come here becaus the altern option suck even more ahem twin peak ahem skeptic chymist ahembig citi bagel doe a veri nice job

now that brooklyn bagel desert ridg is close big citi is the onli game in north scottsdal  they tend make what i call plump bagel  in other word you might not see an open in the middl  but they are great for make sandwich and tasti too

if you are an earli riser i would high recommend come here earli and get the bagel when theyr still toasti hot  the smell insid the store are amaz and dont forget to get your card stamped

enjoyrememb high school footbal when there was the a  b freshmen team well big citi is on my b team i go here when my top choic is swamped

they have a decent select of bagel and assort breakfast type sandwich and soda there is a nice outsid patio

th major problem i have with this place is that they dont understand the phrase ez    on the butter invari i have to spong off the extra gob of butter from the bagel it must be a new york thing someon pleas pass me the secret codethis updat for la fonda del sol lunch buffet

it was 9 month ago when i origin review this nice mexican lunch buffet so it seem time to tri it again  do an updat  i was join today by norm r  robyn n  i found the setup to be just about the same as last time  this buffet doesnt offer as mani food choic as those of pancho or camaron but the food the servic  the price are all good  it a comfort place  they do need to keep a closer watch on the serv tray though as both the beef  chicken fajita were allow to run out as well as the flour tortillas

weekday lunch buffet  895anoth tourist spot this place is not about the food as much as it is about the novelti and charact 

fun spot for kid and families

and even if youv been there a million time someon ought to wear a tie just for gigglback east is well not back east qualiti as i know it i realli do detest new york except for the metropolitan museum of art but i have to say that the best bagel i have ever had was there back east is at least better than the limp sticki thing from einstein imho 

i work veri near here for mani year and i would have to say that their lunch fare was better than breakfast their egg are microwav in a dispos plastic contain and i alway pictur tini littl carcinogen gleefulli nestl into my morn protein i swear that the major of the time the earli morn staff was in serious need of a caffein jolt mmmmm how i love have some slitti eye colleg girl yawn in my face and not cover her mouth wake up bitch and get my order right for once

lunch was far better with a wide varieti of qualiti bagel sandwich so satisfi and fill i would never be tempt by the snack in the breakroom for the rest of the afternoon the blt was super yum with cream chees sprout and cucumb as well as the b the l and the t

drink are are a littl pricey and i alway found the coffe to be just alright the best cup in the immedi area is gold bar but in the direct i came it was a bigger pain to get to most morn you have wors option in the am on the corner of southern and mcclintock than back east bagelthis place has realli gone down hill in the last year i cannot say i know whi either
they use to be veri good
they are not open for lunch which is a bummer in my mind we like to go out to a big meal at lunch at time reather than dinner becaus then you have time to let it digest

anyway this place is veri busi but it seem so corprat the food is get like red lobster where everyth tast the same
i think they realli tri but it is just not there
they realli want to push alcohol on you and starter i know they have to  but it just seem that they are forced
steak were just ok not fantast the potao were rock hard i mean the bake potato so hardeven when we took them home and re cook they were hard
veri strang bathroom are clean our server seem veri over whelm as if she could not handl it all
it is not horribl just not wonder they keep put out coupn and they are good one as well i just do not want to go there when there are so mani good other place sorri it is off my list of good place to go now dayok our second experi at final round was not near as fun as our first time there we went back last saturday night with some friend from out of town and were disappoint to find that it was not as much as of a hidden gem as we thought it to be as i said befor i can realli appreci a good ole dive bar with karaok cheap drink and interest peopl that be said the second time we went even though the drink were still cheap and the crowd was still divers the wait to sing was realli long with these two veri veri loud and grate regular get turn what felt like three time as frequent as everyon els the sound system was turn up way too loud so you couldnt have a convers and the bar servic was realli slow for how mani peopl were there we all left with our ear practic bleed and onli have gotten one chanc to sing in two hour or so 

mayb it just wasnt a good place to take a big group or mayb saturday night are a lot crazier than friday night either way im go to have to retract my origin 5star rate and give this place a 3 im sure well still go back at some point when were in the mood for karaok on a friday night but if we could go to kobalt instead and have 1 more chanc to sing 2 betterqu and justascheap drink 3 friend fast servic and 4 regular who sing well and dont act like they own the place whi wouldnt we35 stars

lunch time it 900 for a larg bowl and a drink  come with unlimit brown or white rice and soup  not a bad deal at all  this is your typic mongolian bbq spot thin frozen meat veggi sauc slap onto round grill eat

mi onli complaint with this place is i feel there are too mani sauc choic  my favorit mongolian bbq spot near ucla had two option  garlic yesno and spici yesno other than that the sauc master did his work and the dish turn out amaz  ycs has like 10 differ sauc combin they present to you and i feel that the last 3 time ive been here i could have chosen better but frank i dont know becaus i never rememb which one i chose previous  in this case like abuj like to say too much custom is not good  perhap im just chase the dragon and tri to get it to tast like my favorit ucla joint and ill never reach that high again no matter how much i tri but damnit im go to tri a few more time sinc ucla is a 6hr drive on a good day

th hostess  cashier was easi on the eye as was the sauc girl  both pretti friend too  girl tend to flirt with me so noth unusu here  5 star for thistwo thing seem to stand out  when i read the review of this place befor dine here good food but lessthanstellar servic and that pretti much what i experienc when i had dinner here with friend we werent sure how mani would be in our group but eight of us had arriv and two small squar tabl had been join togeth for us  a good fit for six peopl but a tight and onli margin accept fit for our parti of eight when anoth person call and said she would be join we request that an adjoin small tabl be ad to our joint tabl which would have also eas up our cramp arrang instead the dour old man mention in the other review grouchili insist on just ad anoth set to one end of the group tabl forc two peopl to squeez into that small space this is extrem unreason given that all the tabl around our parti were empti and remain so for the time we were there in fact veri few other peopl were dine in the restaur that even the gentleman who took our order was a lot more friend but gave us a strang highpressur sale pitch for some dish as jenni r had warn in her review i had given my order for keufta khachkach but he kept push the beef stroganoff say that they may not have enough ingredi for my order  huh he desist when i told him i cant have a creambas dish actual i can i just didnt want anoth dish be push on me it turn out they did have enough ingredi for my dish after all  how bout that

i must say that the food was good and reason price for the qualiti and quantiti and everyon in the parti agre about the qualiti of the food they got  my rate for the food alon four and a half star for the servic alon one and a half star therefor a 3star averag if you plan to dine here expect good food as a reward for your put up with the servic that tri your patiencvisit the phoenix area i want to tri someth that phoenix yelper rave about and ted hot dog appear with a 45 star rate from 7 yelper  we were excit about a place that serv up hot dog and warrant five stars

even though they sold burger and sandwich you have to order some type of sausag or dog when that what they are fame for  my friend and i opt for the polish sausag 325 the bf chose the bratwurst 329 and my other friend went for their regular hot dog 205  i read about their fabul milkshak so chose a chocol shake 305 and their amaz onion ring 259

i request all the sausag and dog to be load up with everyth which look like it includ onion pepper a pickl spear relish ketchup and mustard  i must admit they did look a bit smaller than what im use to  and the cashier couldnt tell the differ between the polish sausag and the bratwurst

in term of the hot dog my friend was not impress he said the hot dog itself tast like ani other hot dog but he did like all the fix on top  the polish sausag tast a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion  you can see lot of spice and stuff in the polish sausag but there wasnt enough kick for my tastes

th chocol milkshak was thick and made from real ice cream  their onion ring remind me of an onion blossom becaus of their thin batter  i wish they had a differ kind of dip sauc for it instead of ketchup

overal my experi at ted hot dog was just okay  mayb it a local thing and you have to be a true local to realli appreci their hot dog and sausag  i guess i just had a littl more in mind

sidenot cash only

tot cost less than 1900 you can see the photo of everyth we order in the busi profil pici wasnt impress  i was excit to tri this place after read so mani of the great review and when rand suggest we go here for lunch i was all for it  

i had a regular hot dog yes they are grill not flame grill but the hot dog are sit out on the back of the grill befor theyr put on the hot part  i thought the hot dog was bland and not veri tasti even after ad some spici mustard onion pickl and tomato  the onion ring were fresh but super greasi and the batter had no flavor at all  a littl salt would have done wonder and i rare put salt on anyth  i even like my french fri unsalted

i do give them a star for have diet dr pepper though

giv me a vienna hot dog ani day over teds

i probabl wont be backi do not know what is go on at this place it use to be a lot nicer
i know that they are fise this whole place up to be high end again but they should just shut it down and start fresh shut it down remodel and reopen

w were stay at the hotel here so we want to give them some busi we went at happi hour the server suggest some realli good food item actual we order about 4 thing they were all realli good
th best thing was those canadian french fri they were realli great we order those on suggust of our server glad we did 
all the food was good  but those were best
it just look old and dirti and worn out in there the manag was stand around do noth the whole time i thought mayb he should of been more pro activ help the staff they were not slam but you can alway help your people
if not whi even be out there helping
i hope they fix it up nice again then we will be back but for the price they charg on everyth it is just not all thatbare resist crazi buffet  their brand new mongolian bbq just across the park lot i stop into this nice coco for lunch start with a delici littl crock of pipe hot chees  potato soup  then it was on to a club sandwich on good qualiti whole wheat toast with a big tasti dill pickl spear on the side

everyth was right about this place includ the ambianc seat comfort food servic  price 799in the neighborhood clean and decent price 

guarante to see crazi line dure peak shop time and never enough cashier to manag this    yet plenti of employe in sight on the floor 

when you have two cashier to everi 1020 custom you can do better come on safewayid like to thank jason w for point out the odor sarcasm  im sure i notic it befor but it didnt bother me until i read his review  

this is the closest groceri store to home so i come here by default  the produc is fresh and a great select  i have no idea how they do it but the avocado are alway ripe at this store  the cucumb are never good though  i should tell the produc guy that who by the way is a total hotti  tall dark and handsom  they also have boar head in the deli cant go wrong there

i was veri excit to see that they were ad a butcher shop this summer  i love to throw bbqs and grill up some delici meat for my friend and famili  sad their select of meat and cut did not increas with the new addit  make me miss my butcher by my old hous downtown

th staff is nice  there an old crabbi cashier that i tend to stay away from becaus she blame me for their machin go down when i swipe my card too fast  other than that everyon is friend and helpyo yao serv american chines food that is pretti good  the food fall solid in the 335 star range

in my onli visit to yao the servic was definit lack  i dont know if this is the norm or they were shortstaf  i had to wave peopl down through the entir time i was at yao to get
refil on water
refil on tea
box to take home leftovers
th check
i final gave up wait for someon to take the bill and took it to the counter

i would tri yao again but probabl just for takeaway35 stars

thi place is definit outsid my 5mile radius  in fact onli the idea of see some of my favorit yelper could entic me to make this hourlong drive from hell  but if i do end up in a hell that requir me to do noth but drive across town over and over again im glad siames kitchen is along the way

veri small restaur with onli 2 peopl run it made for understand slow servic but they work incred hard  i did feel somewhat bad for anyon outsid our group well technic i was outsid our group arriv so late that pick that night to dine at sk

now on to the food  we share spring roll chicken satay and green curri  the chicken satay was just okay  the chicken was just chicken and i thought the peanut sauc was lack  it wasnt rich enough for me but neither is my husband so i cant complain too much  the spring roll were nice and crisp  the green curri was delici  sinc i just like a littl heat i order it mild thank  i guess that true thai mild sinc it was more like medium  but full of flavor

i would definit recommend siames kitchen if you find yourself nearbinot bad pie but probabl not up to newyork expectations

ord two slice and 20 wing hot one slice with mushroom one pepperoni this ray use can mushroom which is ok and they load it up for us and the pepperoni was classic nyc style thin crust with lot of greas im give them 4 star but subtract 1 star for the wing sorri guy buffalo wing need bleu chees dress and a coupl stick of celeri there is no other way do some research ranch dress doesnt cut it period the sauc was fine but they need to be a tad bit more on the crispi side when cook other than that they were good  ok would i go back yea mayb though there are so mani more place to tri i not sure if i ever get back over on that side of town but thank you guy you have a good oper clean  friend as a consol they treat me to a refil on my soda thank you

hop you could make these small chang for your futur custom work my way through my phoenix trip my next dinner out was to meet yet anoth old friend from high school this one i hadnt seen in almost 21 year and thank to fb we got reconnect 

macayo is anoth local mexican chain restaur this locat is the newest probabl open about 8 or 9 year now long ago the locat on central avenu was all the rage but like ani chain sometim growth doe not necessarili equat to great

mi friend and i share a chees crisp i like the one here better than the one at garcia i also had a shred beef taco and black bean and rice the taco had much better flavor than garcia and the bean were good we each had a hous margarita and i onli drank half not becaus i was get sauc but becaus it was kind of nasti 

all in all decent but not blow me away good might come back but there are sever other great mexican food restaur in the valley that i will have to visit next time sad with mom live in sun citi west the schlep to get to some of these place is a bit too great

th waiter again was nice and accommod my friend and i had such a great time get reconnect we also close down this restaur and then sat in front chat till around midnight this becam the second night i did the tip toe walk through my mom hous hope not to wake anyon upi cannot lie i am in love with their pork enchilada but that pretti much where i draw the line i think their decor is obnoxi and the salsa suck even though for some godaw reason it was vote best in phx for 2008 i do not agre i also think their uniform are possibl the ugliest i have ever seen im not sure you could pay me enough to wear those bright ass parrot theme button up although the food is decent this place has never been my first choic for mexican cuisin i onli came here becaus the garcia across the street was close down which upset me to no end becaus their bean dip is fuck amaz well was stupid economi i had a margarita and an hour later still have a decent buzz so cheer to the bartend the portion are big enough for two dude so i alway have leftov their servic is suffic but about as bore as this review is 

i am now in a food coma from the food babi they serv me time for a napwhere do you go when you are extrem hungri have a yen for asian food and onli have 13 to spend  as long as you dont mind the spars and tacki feel of be in a place that look like it use to be a dime store in it prior life then the great wall could just be the place

hey ambienc cost more  the buffet is 995 drink soda milk tea is extra  the waitress are veri attent and refil drink without be ask at no addit charge

com when they first open  you may have to wait a few minut for them to finish bring out all the food but it worth the wait  at least you will have first pick and it all fresh

lot of dim sum in addit to what you expect to see at panda  they throw in a littl japanes tempura and a littl thai just for good measur  all the dish are mark clear and indic whether it hot or spici  person i am partial to the babi octopuss crab puff and bao  for the kiddi there is some american fare like salad jello and egad chicken nuggets

it kinda funni realli but if you are not picki what the heck

thi is not gourmet by ani mean but they wont tri to chase you out and they are kid friendly

if buffet is not your thing they do have a regular menu but whi botherwe came here for valentin day becaus my husband sprint phone was not work   we drop off the phone and walk over for a quick bite  we were lucki we got there befor the crowd  we wait for a few min befor we were greet and sat  within 15 min the place was pack with peopl  

we sat down and receiv a basket of warm chip and two salsa  then we got two cup and a pitcher of water  the ladi did not say anyth to us and left  i was not sure if she is come back or not    

then our server came to greet us  she was veri nice and told us the special  she took our drink order and swoosh she was gone  she had a ton of tabl  she came back quick with drink and to take our food order  

i order the comb 11 chimi with chicken serv with bean and rice  the red sauc had good flavor the chicken itself was bland the rice was good and normal i am not a fan of refri bean but their was pretti good  

to sum up everyth it was okstop into this arriba today for their wednesday lunch special consist of a big bowl of substanti warm tortilla chip a cup of salsa roja a cup of  warm bean dip and a big platter with a machaca taco chees enchilada spanish rice and refri bean  

the background music play too loud for my tast and the tabl servic was amateurish but all the food was delici and fabul inexpens at onli 499 for everyth     good varieti of beers

great locat near arrowhead mall

plenti of parking

food was decent for chain food

servic was a tad slow but the server was friendso were cruis back into the valley of the sun from a week long archaeolog dig out in prescott where it was apenut freez but we still somehow manag to be sweati and dirti i think chang a tire in the middl of bfe was respons for that lug nut dont turn too well when your finger refus to follow your brain order becaus the wind chill enough to make a grown man cryand then freez those futil tear to his cheeks

so we were super psych at the prospect of sleep in our own bed and enjoy posit balmi 50 degre weather and what better way is there to celebr than with a quick stop for a piec of pie

rock spring cafe off the i17 is just what the sweet tooth order 

just dont depend on them to satisfi much else

th good thing is that road weari folk fit right in among the multitud of famili that frequent the place i mean it out in the middl of pretti much nowher black canyon citi region so trucker and kiddo are forc to coincid in harmoni and man was that place crawl with kid not my cuppa but the wild west general store and saloon environ with antiqu cover the wall is certain the kind of place where kid will have a ball so consid stretch your leg here if your on a road trip with the littl ones

wel provid you can get a seat to begin with the wait staff consist of small town folk that realli seem to dislik their job theyr either 60 or 16 we wait a good ten minut or so to be seat becaus all the waiter and waitress onli had eye for their current custom and the hostess had appar taken an extend smoke break unfortun onc we were seat we realiz that while the waitress did onli have eye for her custom they were evil evil eye she was a crotcheti old granni figur that look disapprov upon everi decis we made 

the food was pretti sucki we order the fish sandwich tuna melt and open face hot roast beef and came to the general consensus that yeah it edibl not ten buck an entre worth of edibl but it too late to rectifi that now the fish had to be a freez dri puck that was fri doubl it cook time the gravi for the beef had to be reconstitut from powder natur to accompani the mound of what use to be potato flake the tuna melt was flavorless and the fri were probabl freezer burnt it was a foodlik product probabl reflect the fact that it was out in the middl of bfe and they subsist off a biweek frozen food shipment

but the pie jack daniel pecan tennesse whiskey lemon and your good mayb a rhubarb if your feel friski the rest of the fill tast like ani groceri store brandstop in for  a quick dinner at rock springs

real great servic but the food was just ok i know this place is known for it pie so mayb i should have had that for dinner

had the chicken fri steak and it was ok but wasnt exact a tast sensat i would be back becaus the servic was fast and charmour kid love the food at cracker barrel when theyr away from phoenix they lament rhapsod reflect on the heaven food last serv to them at cracker barrel 

darrin love the catfish and green order it for breakfast lunch or dinner everi time hes in town chrissi enjoy the light fluffi pancak 

although jr jake prefer pancak at coco hes smitten by the general store fill with candi curio and toy toy and more toy hes amus by the checker board wait for the next set of player to sit and play and hes delight by the peg board at each tabl wait for him to invent his own fun

w ate dinner then breakfast the follow morn at cb 

 except custom servic 
 enchant general store decor for christma uncommon yet afford tree ornament and toy 
 mediocr foodif you would have ask me to review cucina tagliani 10 year ago my 13 year old self would have imperi declar in that haughti know it all tone hormon tween use to berat their exhaust parent that they were the best italian restaur in arizona if you were to ask me 3 year earlier who would hold that place id have bold dub oliv garden 
nowaday i am a littl older a smidgen wiser and a tad bit more experienc and i can confid declar them to be aok at best
certain tagliani is not the best italian restaur in the valley let alon the state but they are pretti darn tasty
i would describ them as oliv garden more voluptu and come sister
i have fond memori of cucina tagliani old locat when it was situat around 59th and bell my famili would come here on birthday and when we had relat visit it was alway a pleasant visit i cant realli speak for the locat off the 101 but im assum it is in the same vein as it ghost which linger in a sad strip mall mile away from my tweenhood
i cannot conceiv of whi anyon in their right mind would wait in line at og with these guy down the block either ignor or a past bad experi who know but tagliani you are aok in my bookeveri onc in a while ill meet my henderson friend here for a drink or three  we enjoy meet here becaus it a fun place to meetup  well head to one of the bar and have a beer and for the gambler in the group they enjoy the huge select of video poker machin offered

sinc i dont gambl i stick around the bar area and peopl watchgood times

th casino is alway kept clean and the employe are most friend  the onli thing i dont like is parkingi prefer the park garag in the back of the properti rather than the surfac lot which seem to be a magnet for road ragers

return factor  40on becaus i live on the other side of townafter have a pretti good experi at the last l  l httpwwwyelpcombizt8hbrjam5r1z0hh0i4wajqhridnx30xaimago3kjtmqsvq i was crave for more of it  howev instead of go to the s maryland parkway one in vega i was at the n stephani locat in henderson

a alway i had a regular order of pork lau lau  it was about 7 and came with two small scoop of rice and one small scoop of mac salad  the mac salad was creami and pepperi  imagin my surpris though to find not one but two pork lau laus in my order  wow  they were alreadi get four star just for serv up two of these babi  in all my year of order this stuff i have never gotten two in a regular order  they never offer a mini order of pork lau lau either  howev the pork lau lau was a bit wateri  it wasnt dri thank gawd  but it lack flavor  i had to dous it with a lot of soyu unfortun  they did have a good amount of pork and fatti good in there though

th bf request a combo with chicken katsu and hawaiian bbq short rib  his order cost 770  upon open the box he saw the chicken was a bit darker than he would have prefer either it from overfri it or old oil  i think it was from the former becaus the katsu was realli crunchi  his order was surpris larg and we both end up with leftov  his short rib had a distinct sauc on the rib like they put the sauc on top of it after it was cooked

cleanli of the store was an issu here  initi we were seat at a booth and saw this red sauc on the wall  uh is that hot sauc   yeah  uh okay thenlet move  there is hot sauc up on these wall and dark mark too that i think a good wipe down would take care of  they obvious have a leak in their ceil as you can see by the dark water stain from abov  and it just a bit grimi here  i dont think anyth bother to clean up the tabl or seat here  

sidenot they do offer a weekday lunch special  for 495 you get  a choic of chicken katsu bbq chix or bbq pork and it come with a 16 oz soda their daili appet rice and mac salad

overal i give them four star for the amount of food your get for the price  in term of qualiti that where the star go down  and plus stuff on the wall should alway bring your star mark down too  take your order to go so you wont have to see the grimei final ventur to weiss for lunch with my friend i have heard talk of this place for age so was excit to tri what they had to offer sinc everyon seem to alway rave about their chicken noodl soup so i knew i had to give that a chanc i decid on the half sandwich and soup to maxim the amount of thing i could tri im not typic a big fan of deli meat but still went with the corn beef 

the soup came out quick and was enorm lot of meati piec of chicken and a huge matzo ball in the center the matzo ball was perfect im usual easi to pleas with these the soup was a littl underseason for my tast so i had to add some salt and pepper i rare ever have to add salt to anyth so this was veri veri rare for me the soup was veri fill and by the time my sandwich came out i was stuf i ate about half my half sandwich which was enorm as well and packag the rest to go with me my friend order the pastrami burger with fri it was huge and look realli good and meati the patron at the next tabl were impress as well and kept ask him about his order and if it tast as good as it look to which he answer yes my sandwich was good and i enjoy it for the mot part the bread was a littl dri but ad mustard realli enhanc the flavor i would be curious about their club or reuben next time as those look tasti as well as their breakfast item 

servic was friend but they were short with us and we felt a bit rush after our second drink refil the server left the pitcher on our tabl without a word make us feel like we were bother him a bit our other server was effici but not veri chatti and didnt make much effort beyond what was expect 

for the most part we had a decent meal and id be curious to check them out again and tri some more item from their veri extens menubonsoir bon appetit  what  wait staff use more french phrase now  alright what go on here mimi total makeov francai takeov that what
 
mimi hq has new handler now from the tone i got from read the menu they are go away from famili style and turn it up a littl more fanci schmanci dine boeuf dip francai aka french dip look at the menu youll see  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosmimiscafehendersonselectjnwhodjwt3cbkju715ajnwhodjwt3cbkju715a   dinner menu is cut down to just one page i thought mayb there was anoth menu float around but our server said nope that the new menu now  oh and it look like kid menu is gone too i didnt see ani kid friend menu select mayb you can request it

what is cool is they are use more french tradit cook techniqu what is not so cool it all still tast meh  when i start eat my order of pot pie nouveau english translat chicken pot pie there was no chicken in it  think to myself mayb i order the vegetarian version no lie i thought i was be punkd there for a minut  it was then my server came up and ask is there chicken in there oop  staff apolog  this new menu was just implement this week  they were all still get use to the new procedur and forgot to add chicken it all good i understand i actual feel sorri for the employe though they look and seem to be awkward  with the whole french style but despit that servic was cest magnifique

with all that said i will be back sinc i am intrigu by the new transform au revoiri go back and forth with this restaur ive been come here a long time i do like the complimentari chip salsa and bean dip it my favorit part about gong to a mexican restaur instant snack 
the chip come out hot and are refil as need 

servic is usual pretti good our waiter made an great effort and kept our drink refil 

i just feel that the qualiti of the entre dont equal the price the food is ok but not amaz 

i order the taquito dinner but the rice was dri bean and taquito were averag i had mine fill with beef which was ok my friend order a burrito but she found it to be dri she thought it should have had some chees on it  all in all 30 for two mediocr entre doesnt seem to be that good of a deali happen to be in the mall of all place while on vacat in vegas

decid to pop in and relax while i had a littl lunch  see how shop can realli drain your energi as well as your wallet  i know what your think  red robin there a ton of great place to eat in vega  whi the hell would you end up there  well i was crave a great burger and i need one fast

thi rr is probabl just like all the other rrs youv ever walk into in your entir life  i was seat in a small tabl near the window look into the busi galleria mall  after check out the menu i decid on a keep it simpl plain burger   the server apolog for the longish wait and took my order  it took what i thought was a long time for my food to final arriv  but i was pleas with both the qualiti and how larg my burger was  i wasnt in a big hurri so the wait didnt realli bother me

if your in the mood for a gourmet burger check out rr in the galleria mall  id like to explor the menu and tri differ burger the next time im there

3 outta 5 star from me  worth check out if your in the areawell i realli like the improv they made here last visit the menu was just a two side lamin card now the extens menu is a mini booklet new drink some new appet too

 still i wasnt impress with the new signatur burger that is be market pepper  smoke  smoke sea salt smoke and pepper ketchup black pepper bacon ciabatta bread   sound awesom  good combo of ingredi sad execut wise the handmad angus beef burger was a fail here  i didnt tast a hint of pepper or smoki flavor at all  now that i think back on it could be they gave me the wrong order sinc it resembl more like a bbq burger with fri onion and bbq sauc  either way though the patti was dri and no flavor  

i realli like the servic though this time around  the side of  yukon potato chip and onion dip is pretti good and i like the price point for the side 35 and 7 dollar  so mayb ill just keep this place in mind for happi hourwelcom to dan adventur in the ghetto a friend and i decid that we need to explor the option in our work neighborhood emphasi on hood  our first pick uss fish and chip  

im not a big fish and chip person  most of the fish and chip dish i have tri have been soggi dri or just plain nasti  even though uss is a korean restaur i decid to tri their claim to fame cuisin  a big plate of 3 big fish strip and potato wedg cost about 675  i was complet blown away  this was the best fish and chip i think i have ever had  they were pleasant fri not too thick and greasi  the fish was tasti on it own but even tastier with some malt vinegar and tarter sauc  the potato wedg were shape like littl chip about a centimet thick they were light and fluffi but meati at the same time

you dont come to uss for the atmospher  you probabl dont come for the gourmet servic either  you may have to dodg the occasion drug dealer or hobo but for a decent fish and chip dish it is worth it  pleasant surpris  i would return  bewar of the cash onli policii heard some kid at the local target call this the ghetto wal mart  i still dont agre  yes there are peopl in their dirti sweat to shop there were sever beat up car in the park lot loud play music at the mcdonald insid for an egg mcmuffin and coffe it smell like vomit  anoth custom ask the secur guard about it and he nonchal said yeah about half hour ago mayb i read him wrong but it sound like a common occurr the way he talk  they certain didnt use bleach like theyr suppos to the mcdonald tabl and  floor were dirti but at least the egg mcmuffin that i had to wait for was fresh made  the store bathroom were not veri clean either

th store was a bit cleaner but as far as select and qualiti veri hit and miss produc wasnt fresh sweet corn husk were dri enough to be decor  lot of shelv were bare but i can forgiv that right after thanksgiv  the watermelon i bought wasnt sweet at all not good sinc i almost bought two of them at 4 each  the cloth select onli had even number inseam which mean a 6 tailor job  

on the good side electron were well stock and so were most cloth a lot of the great black friday deal could still be found throughout the store at 10 am includ their 32 inch flat screen tv  checkout was slow but not bad for a black friday  lot of manag were on hand to resolv problems

pric are good though and the cashier realli work hard to be fast and courteous and employe realli do tri to help you out but i think the new wal mart about five mile north are a way better shop experi over alli like chipotl the servic at this store is spotti though it right down the street from my bfs hous so we go here often i alway get a steak burrito bowl or salad as well as a bag of the lime tortilla chip then i ask for extra salsa and sour cream but on the side they dont charg for extra side of top so now i have like 4 thing to dip my chip into and they were all free it funni becaus they have chip and salsa on the menu for like 165 and in realiti you can just do what i do and pay for onli chip which are like 95 cent winif this place were a bar by itself on a street somewher id probabl be consid it for 4 star  unfortun like mani thing in las vega it is tuck away in the corner of an obscen larg casino  the casino in question is way off the strip  the pub is up on the second or third floor and way off in the corner    our search for this place felt like an episod of  lord of the ring  follow sign backtrack split up and meet again etc  we had a great advantag over the hobbit in that we had our cell phone to keep in touch  furthermor we could stop and rest along the way with booz food and of cours crap  those poor littl hobbits

our 8 person parti was escort to a tabl through a labyrinth of small roomsanteroom and seat for dinner  we drank like fish ate lot of fish and chip and enjoy the band  it was for the most part a great bar band the kind you often see in vega if your just walk around  it was a littl jar to have to leav the nice dark wood and dim light of the pub to go out into the casino and find the restroom but we all surviv  
unless your alreadi out in green valley for some reason i cant imagin ani great reason to hit this place  howev if you are alreadi in the build it a decent place to drink  they also show lot of rugbi premier leagu and other europeanintern sport event at the usual earli morn time if your so inclinlook for a late night sushi place that offer happi hour special we were refer to osaka in henderson

walk into this pretti big and establish restaur were given three menus to perus  there seat avail at the sushi bar the tabl and even tatami room  the menus are quit extens and you have to spend a great deal of time do the match game  one menu offer the happi hour special but in order to find out what in each roll you have to read through their regular menu  it take a good while  a larg select of roll and thank good for pictur  they all start to sound the same though and mani of them overlap  they also offer this buy 10 get one free from their special roll menu    you can also do shabu shabu sukiyaki or yosenab here if youd like  

we final decid on a few thing from their happi hour menu and surpris we didnt end up with much sushi  

777 roll 995 hh price 1295 reg  shrimp scallop miki tobiko cream chees top with avocado albacor and serv with garlic and yumyum sauc  it a pretti good roll but fatti as hell becaus that yumyum sauc is a mayonnaisebas sauc  you can tell how bad it is for you onc you take the first bite  

deep fri tofu 350 hh price 495 reg  also known as agedashi tofu  it was a bit tough not easi to break apart  i prefer my agedashi a littl softer so my spoon can gentl cut into it

tonkatsu 350 hh price  im not a particular big fan of the pork cutlet but the bf is  he thought it was pretti good and such a great valu that he order another

shishamo 280 hh price 380 reg  grill smelt fish with smelt egg  it was okay here  ive had better  a bit tough and on the smaller end

th mackerel was cure just fine and cover with my fave veget green onion  the uni was okay  the salmon skin handrol was stuf and it was prepar with gobo kaiwar cucumb and avocado without sauc which was veri good  the quail egg shooter had 3 quail egg yolk masago green onion and ponzu which was differ and tasti  i got the amaebi last  the sushi was good and the fri head were enorm and cover in tempura batter  they were on top of shred daikon and serv with ponzu  i was veri full after all of this and i am glad i tri it final  howev there is no excus for poor rice when sushi is about rice so i do not see myself returnthis was my 3rd time here anoth food trip inspir by a restaurantcom 25 gift certificate

i will buy anoth gc  restaurantcom but i will stay away from the burger and stick to the pork tenderloini give it a 3 star becaus the servic suck my roommat dog left nut

today was the first time in 10 year of come here that everyth about it was pretti crappi salti but otherwis flavorless duck won ton is miss the chunk of shrimp that have alway been there add to that some pretti bland broth and you have a good size bowl of sad and disappoint 

qualiti of our other usual have also gone down in the past year or so  beef chow fun singapor noodl salt  pepper pork chop and the whole friend chicken hate to say it but im almost readi to give up on this placeserv fine chinesevietnames cuisin out on spring mountain in chinatown

thi place is usual pretti busi and popular it is also veri clean with nice decor start with the beauti and color larg fish tank at the door good feng shui 

they have a larg menu of vietnames and chines dish so you can have a bowl of pho all they way up to a canh chua ca bong lau sweet and sour catfish soup or tom ham rang muon bake live lobster with salt and pepper and everyth in between like hu tieu mi com bun ga bo and chao

w had pho tai and pho tai nam we ask for medium size but they came out more typic of a small in littl saigon or san jose but the broth was veri good with not a lot of junk float in it but a lot of flavor in a more clear broth than the muddi water some place  tri to give you it had a great flavor with a hint of sweet like good pho should 

unfortun for some reason my noodl didnt tast fresh and silki as they should with a littl chew to it instead they seem old and chalki somehow the beef tai was full round and the nam was tender and tasti 

the price were about 1 more than you would pay elsewher but they have the broth down veri well and with the nicer decor it is a good choic if wasnt for my noodl it might have got  4 starcrawfish is a new addit to pho kim long and that what brought me here in the first place  they onli start offer this shellfish in june weekend only

mi luck that the sunday i choos to come in they werent offer it we still sat down for dinner and this is what we got 

 hu tieu hoac mi bo kho beef stew egg noodl  795 the big f enjoy his noodl soup  i was too busi with my plate to eat much of his

 dau dua xao xo sauc stir fri string bean with xo sauc  995 tasti string bean a bit on the pricey side though  a nice spice kick as well

 com ga hai nam hai nam style chicken with season rice 850 ive alway like hainames chicken sinc my friend mom made it for me along with the season rice  it good here but definit not as good as my friend mom version

pho kim long ii is a huge restaur with lot of big tabl for larg parti  a great place for famili to eat and friend to gather after a late night  their menu is pretti extens so there plenti of choic for everyon  and portion seem pretti decents too  i wish they would get a bigger fish tank though becaus there are way too mani fish in that tini thing up front

from this experi i give it a four stars

i love hot n juici crawfish up the road and i definit believ in some healthi competit  so last friday we decid to final check out their crawfish and see if it worthy

w decid to start off with two pound and see where we went for there     we notic a neighbor tabl with their order of crawfish and was definit excit  it came in a larg bowl with red potato corn on the cob and sausag  they also brought extra bowl for the shell and a plate for us to eat on  the big f request lime salt and pepper to make a dip concoction

i dove right in and notic the big differenceth crawfish was not fresh  it was old or way overcook  the tail meat didnt come off the shell easili and was broken up  i thought it was just the first one and continu eat  unfortun this wasnt the case  there was littl to no head juic either which was veri disappoint to me  the big f was easili disgust with the crawfish and we were glad that we onli order two pound to start  we usual go for two pound each  the corn potato and sausag were good though but it didnt make up for the bad crawfish  sinc it come in a bowl there no sauc on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it  no bib were provid which explain all the stain on my shirt

when im crave crawfish ill drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at hot n juicy

for this experi i give it a two stars

overal a four star for their vietnames food and a two star for their bad crawfish  im give pho kim long ii a three star

pic are postive alway heard from numer peopl say that this place was the best place for pho 

on a friday night me and a group of girl decid to come after clubbin at tao after drop the drunki back off at the hotel we head to pho kim long we didnt get here till around 430am and to my surpris this place was pretti pack but they still had a coupl of tabl open park around this place look pretti decent

th pho was pretti good and is alway good when your still drunk or if you have a hangov the rice plate here are also pretti good price are compar to that of the price we have in sf for pho the servic was good all the waiter were super nice overal the pho was good but ive had better before

not ask one of the waiter to call a cab for you if you didnt drive here becaus you cannot flag down taxi on the street they will not stop becaus they cant pick peopl up off the street or you can wait for a taxi to enter the park lotwell it open late that whi everyon come here  if kinh do a block away didnt close at 10 pm i wouldv been there  on a saturday night at 11 pm we were quot a 30 minut wait time but end up onli wait 10 minut for a tabl of four

i live by littl saigon in southern california so if compar to the pho there pho kim long pho and bun dish are normalabout averag  there wasnt anyth that stood out good or bad about them  i had the vermicelli with grill pork and egg roll  my friend had the pho  

drink here are a tad expens  i think it was 350375 for ice coffe fresh lemonad with soda and preserv lemon with soda  

the servic here is good  numer server came to check ontak our order  if i was crave some late night pho after a night out on the town id come here againthis place is veri authent mayb too authent smallish seat area kinda of confus upon arriv and the languag barrierif you speak spanish your in if you dont well there is some slight misunderstand natur the big thing is the food is done veri well and the portion generous veri tasti food and done while you wait that the short stori 

now for the longer stori veri obscur and strang locat on the inner corner of an out build in the se corner of the strip mall where the saver is at sahara and decatur 

when we arriv we were met and ask if we spoke spanish we dont so they then locat the one person who also spoke english and she ask if we had eaten colombian food befor well we had and explain how and where we were then told how colombian food is not like mexican food and other thing we alreadi knew she was veri patient 

note i thought everyon knew colombian food is more like argentinian food than their norther cousin guess not 

we were then given sampl empanada fresh made littl pocket of joy is a better descript word especi when taken with a spoon of the accompani sauc a must tri if you go

w order tongu on arepa  corn cake  and colombian chorizo on plantain we also order the fruit drink next time well skip the fruit drink but if you order them have them with milk the water one separ too quick and tast well water down realli 

and we wait and wait not a problem for me but the ladi take our order seem worri for me i  am one who doesnt mind wait for food prepar after i order it not wait for me under the unhealthi glow of heat lamp  think bad chines buffet  so wait is not a problem besid i like look around im nosi what can i say the dine area will not upstag the food and the smell of the place is wonder do not be in a hurri to eat 

but

th wait is worth it except i got shred beef not tongu which was veri nice done though the food is fill and has fresh veget garnish for cool the palett nice and the proport generous but i had to ask if they were out of tongu or didnt rememb me order it the gal thought she told me but forgot honest mistak at least she wasnt tri to slip one past this gringo and i realiz tongu isnt alway avail but tell me first and ill order tripe soup or someth els other than beef which i can get anywhere

bottom line i think this is the place where the food is king the atmospher isnt go to shine and the servic is ok but you go for the food they do have a websit menu check it out first 

i plan on go back for a few thing and know what to expect take away ani disappoint mayb next time well get treat like the foodi we are not mcdonald patron who wander into the wrong place

ethn place need to rememb im here for the food they cook not a hamburg and fri give me empanada or give me death just kid ill settl for arepa and tongu thoughcheap meal close to vega can be found in the vega chinatown where the asian food resides

i was skeptic that this restaur would be mediocr becaus it was a vietnames  chines fusion restaur but i order my 3 banh mi regardless lot of bread it was just okay  the eggrol on the other hand were surpris delici 

anoth vega budget meal for those gambler whove lost too much money at the tabl but bewar you get what you pay forso you are crave pho after a night out and about all over lost wage what are you go to do go to chinatown err asiatown and get some pho

th pho is ok the other stuff is ok also it seem a bit pricey on some item like an extra buck or two over so cal price but it is vega so yeah 

pro tip make sure that the waitress complet understand your order our was wrong in 34 place out of a group of about 15 

sinc they do not speak english veri well here be warn the food is veri averag as well i have had much better and much wors none the less a bowl of pho in lost wage can be a veri good thing even when it veri average

also they dont take all credit card i think just mastercard and visathis is your classic diveasianrestauranttakeoutbuffetjointandmapaconveniencestor 

this place special in quick take out food with a steam tabl of rice and other vietnames deli food to make assort com dishes
ther are also a few shelv of dessert and deliconveni food  

but it has about 6 tabl to sit and eat and you can watch the tv with a dvd play over and over again the tradit vietnames outfit contest portion of the miss univers pageant in nha trang vietnam

they have a decent smatter of vietnames fair in a grungi envirn devoid of ani charm but the food is pretti good khai vi pho bo about 17 combo hu tieu mi xao com dia che and special dish like bun bo hue bun rieu  banh cuon goi du du nem nuong cuon etc 

they also have boba drink coffe etc

dont expect great servic 

the pho tai bo vien and pho tai came in quit larg bowl with full size round of rare beef and decent size meat ball there was also a lot of noodl more than most place onli 499 good price even for san jose or littl saigon 

if you want quick to go viet food or a cheap and larg bowl of pho in las vega tri here it is in a 2 stori strip mall just below korean garden bbq

open 7 day a week 9 am til 9 pmso aloha mean both hello and goodby  now how can i work that into my review

her goes

to begin with it ive never seen a combin bar and hawaiian fast food place

aloha hello kitchen remind me of a typic hawaiian fast food place well lit with a lot of cheesi decor
besid have the basic plate they also carri some uniqu stuff i tri the adobo fri rice and the wife tri the saimin soup  the food wasnt realli anyth to yelp about but sinc it is a chain kinda place you shouldnt expect too much
id be will to go back just becaus they serv poke one of the item i dont find at a fast food place on friday and saturday
so until then aloha goodby kitchen

aloha hello bar is right next door to the kitchen but is a 180 from the kitchen dark with a dive feel to it  but it still gave off the laid back island life vibe
bartend was cool and even spoke to me in dakin  thanks
sh stop though when my face went blank and didnt respond  sorry
th music had the kinda beat i could groov to for a coupl hour and the crowd was chill
aft a some drink and a coupl game of pool i was say aloha goodby bar  good thing sinc they just fire up the karaok machine

overal ill be say aloha hello sooner to the bar than the kitchen

a special aloha to all the vega yelper from hawaii
ther are a bunchmy gal pal and i stop by for a quick bite while in the neighborhood 

we place our order at the counter our first time so my friend ask how did they do their macaroni salad my friend is from hawaii origin and has had macaroni salad mani differ way she was curious so ask as she did not want to regret a doubl order of a style of mac salad she may not likeyou catch my drift

th clerk repli that she had no clue howev she ad she think it may have chop cucumb in it she also state she had never tast it befor ok so be the type we are we go for it and wield the consequ laterso doubl order of the mysteri mac salad it is

it was a bit bland not made with best food most like store brand mayo not sweet not veri flavor howev if mix in with everi other item on your plate it doe the trick

w order the the pork laulau serv with rice and macaroni salad
thi dish was good the laulau was a great present veri tender juici and tasti it was a nice portion inde the sticki rice was good as well

i also order a side of lumpia shanghai wsweet chile sauc the way i like it mmmmmm yummy

i make chicken lumpia at home i will come here for my pork lumpia

al in all was an ok meal some good balanc with some bland rate this review with a 3 star

suggest is have your employe know the food question about their menu is someth they should be prepar for just sayichiza is one of the spot we we frequent when our famili come in from japan  i recommend call in for reserv ahead of time if you have a larg parti becaus of limit seat rememb if you get the 2 tabl in the back you usual have a 2 hour max time slot

w usual order a bunch of differ dish and just sharefamili style it is an izakayahalf barhalf restaur mani of the dish are tapa style

wev had better izakaya but the go to food at ichiza that we would recommend are not necessarili in this order

1gril eggplant
2 uni pon
3 broil miso cod
4yellowtail tartar
5 robatapork belli in shiso leaf 
6 beef bowl

peopl rave about ichiza and i say they are ok ive tri mani of their to die for menu item but i wasnt wow i suppos we could give ichiza a 4 star but it hard to mayb becaus we visit famili in japan a coupl time a year we set the bar high and our expect are base on that they are not as consist as they onc were with their food the price are decent the servic weve experienc is sub par right up until my wife speak japanes to them and late it been pack and veri loud probabl due to the fact that they dont do lunch servic  anymore

dont get me wrong they are a good bang for your buck type of place just check out the other yelper they love it dont take my word for itgo tri them out im sure youll find someon thing delici on their menu

alohamy sister came to vega a coupl of month ago and was rave about the roast duck she chow on from sam woo  she live in san francisco and my parent were veri skeptic about her excit about this fabul duck that she beg them to fli back with on their recent visit they refused

th husband and i want to see if it was all quack up as she said it was suppos to be  

mission roast duck to go

w did the quick take out side although a peek at the menu definit reflect that it a better deal to take out if you can

12 for half a roast duck
19 for whole roast duck

it was pretti easi to go for the whole duck  we also order a coupl of box of steam rice as well so we could eat on the run

it was good  but then again we havent had ani other roast duck in vega and it been a long time sinc weve had roast duck in general  sure ive had fattier duck though than what sam woo offer but there was definit a good flavor in there  the skin is the best part but they could definit have more meat on them

w ate half last night and the other half tonight  we think we got a pretti good deal on the duck and we were satisfi with that

i spent some time live in socal so ive had a few visit to sam woo bbq there  it definit has me look for other place that serv up roast duck though

cash onli on the take out sidei wouldnt say this place is bad but it not great either here are the item you should order on the ayc 1595 steam egg pork belli beef brisket also they have pretti good side dish but in particular i didnt like the broccoli that they made in the end it all a pretti good price for what they give you but those are the best item in my opinion 

servic was good for me there wasnt a long line or a ton of peopl eat here it was veri privat and bright insid plus they have a great window view ofchinatown haha i feel like they did make our grill way too hot it was burn my face and my food and i had to ask them to turn it down 

id probabl come here again becaus it cheap and good plus there are no extrem long line next time im just gonna turn the grill down and keep that brisket cominthere are some place that i order the same thing 99 of the timeand this is one of them  i alway get the 3 item combo with

fri ricechow mein
orang chicken
sweet  sour chicken
beef  broccoli

thi locat is solidfresh ingredi and quick service

wil i return  when i need a quick chines fixsurmy experi here wasnt as great as i thought it would be base on the number of averag star food express has for the number of review  we had a languag problem a coupl of time last night

i order the moo shu pork for an appet for the two of us and chicken with green bean for a main cours also to be share  the moo shu was brought out in a relat quick time  there were four plump pancak fill with good  it appear that food express use the tortilla like wrapper instead of the thinner tradit pancak  the roll were flavor but befor we even had one eaten the server was back with our main cours  i hate that so much

when the chicken arriv it was not chicken with green bean but chicken with broccoli  that was a languag problem or simpli an error on the server part  we took the meal  i wouldnt wast that food for one vegetable

when we were finish i ask if there was a dessert menu  the server mumbl someth point to the kitchen and then left the tabl  a few minut later he came back with two small bowl of warm sweeten red bean soup which was our dessert i guess but he never said anyth more

mi wife didnt care for her dessert so i finish two  im glad it was small

ther are mani thing on the menu id love to tri but im a littl gun shi  im not sure ill be back  spring mountain road i think ill go your direct next timethey are call island style but onc you see their menu you will discov that they serv hawaiin korean and american dishes

first off if you are not activ look for their sign you are definit gonna miss it even when i park i still had to look around for what door i had to go in the door to their restaur isnt label so after stick my head in there i confirm it 

so i sit down and the nice ladi hand me a menu just like that they put a small to go box of boil peanut on your tabl i guess you can take it home if you dont finish nice they also give you a glass of water by default also nice but that where i notic my good experi ends

i order beef teriyaki they bring it out accompani with a sampler plate of kim chi which consist of cabbag bean sprout some kind of radish and slice hot dog as for the teriyaki beef they actual give you a decent amount of beef and rice refer to my pic 

i probabl would of enjoy my meal better if i got a refil or two on my water as soon as i got my food the next time i saw the server she was bring out my check i ask nice for a refil on my water i decid to pay with cash for i had a feel it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refil think that charg my card will also take some time i wasnt in ani rush or anyth but there were peopl wait to sit down and eat 

so overal i wasnt realli blown away my bill was about 10 dollar i tip 2 buck which was what i thought was more than generous consid my mediocr experi i dont think i will be go out of my way just to eat herei came to diamond china with some friend on a late night after watch a movi see below yelp review too for my movi theatr review  it one of the chines restaur that is open late in vega outsid of the strip they are open till 200am fridaysaturday and sundaythursday 11001200am

w order togo and i was quit surpris how quick they got our order cook and readi the food we got were 150deep fri pork chop with pepper salt for 775 and the 130 boneless chicken with veget for 750 

the boneless chicken with veget was nice becaus there were differ kind of veggi i found the deep fri pork chop a bit on the salti side overal i thought the food was just averag portion were small which was a bit disappoint the size were not what i would think would be serv for a dinner it was small and not someth i would expect for famili style chinese

i like that this is open late  i like their quick servic but other than that i found this place just sosoit late on a sunday night and the bf suggest tri out the origin osaka after have visit their second locat a few week back 

walk through the front door you immedi face a wall  not the most feng shui im sure but make a right down the hall and youll see anoth entranc which bring you right to the sushi bar  i note to the bf that this locat was way smaller and he then point out they had more room in the back  we took a walk down there after eat to check out their tatami room lot of space semipriv booth and a hibachi grill area too  they are pretti fanci here with slide show run on a comput screen at everi booth in the back  i would be even more impress if it was a touch screen where you can order all your food by press your select  that would be super high tech  

anyway back to the review and the food  the menus are pretti much the same at both locat for the most part  from their late night happi hour menu this is what we ordered

 shishamo 280  it came with three piec  again a bit tougher than what im use to  they season it with black pepper but i ask for some salt to give it a littl more kick too

 koreanstyl spici chicken 450  it liter stirfri chicken with korean spici sauc on a bed of lettuc  i wasnt sure if the lettuc was garnish or to eat  oh well i ate it

 crazi hors roll 420  it tuna salmon masago and mix togeth with spici sauc  it a veri basic roll but pretti good

 fire roll 390  crab meat and spici sauc  unfortun it look like the ca roll you buy from the supermarket but without the avocado in it  it had a bit of kick in it

and from their regular menu 

 ankimo 695  monkfish liveroh how i love this stuff  it an acquir tast  i like to soak my chunk in ponzu sauc and then break off a tini piec and savor each littl morsel  the bf like to dunk his piec into the sauc and then toss the whole thing in his mouth  he like to then mush it around in his mouth  haha

they are known for their exot and color roll and they can be a bit a pricey  it our unfortun luck that the onli two roll we order were so visual bore  

servic it wasnt too busi this late in the even  a hand of peopl at the bar and few peopl at the tabl  the bf had to ask for his soda to be refil and the waitress never came back with his drink  when he ask for it the waitress got him anoth one  then a few minut later she came by and took his drink away  we were wonder whi she did that  when she came back with his drink she said she was refil it again  i guess to make up for his drink disappear in the first place  the bf ask for my own pot of tea sinc im a big tea drinker and to save them the troubl of have to refil my teacup everi five seconds

on waiter came by twice to take away dish that we werent done yet  in the process he would tri to squeez in between us to reach for the plate onli to realiz there was still food on it  and final at the end of our meal when the plate was clear empti then he ask if he could take it  we were amus  and actual when we are both done share a plate we actual put it to the side to help them out for that reason  so they dont have to reach in between a coupl of lovebird  duh     

dont forget that you can get a 10 coupon when you visit their website

yep there pic of our food eat in the busi profilsinc raku was close for the first coupl day of the new year we had to search for anoth new place to eat
w found osaka japanes bistro

first of all there some histori to this place  it been around for over 40 year so you have to assum they know what theyr do  it also in a slight shadi part of town where onli local should go or those who are lost search for ichiza find themselves

w start off with some sushi roll and sashimi  meh  ive had fresher sashimi and better tast roll combin  although i did like the fact osaka offer half order on most of their rolls

th entre we order was a littl better  we order the john special and had a good time to share  tempura was batter a littl heavier than im use to but the chicken and beef teriyaki had a good flavor

th dessert was surpris good  we had the green tea tiramisu i know it a tradit italian dessert but doesnt it just sound japanes  i would have never have guess that the flavor of mascarpon and green tea would marri so well  it was pricey but worth the experience

overal id be will to go back for late night eat dessert and drink but will have to pass on have dinner here againfor 2 year ive been drive by jimmyjohn today i stop in

i am alway hesit of ani place that has gourmet in the name that usual just mean overpriced

right away you are greet by everyon readi to take your order immedi you will notic a small menu board of onli cold lunchmeat sandwichesno phillyspizzasetc

i order a 14roast beef  turkey on wheat 7

dont get me wrong it was all fresh and a tasti lunchmeat sandwich but noth to write home about ill keep drive by in the future

p they delivonc upon a time i was a huge fan of this baja fresh locat  my cowork and i  use to come here all the time for lunch  then about 4 yrs ago i notic a rapid declin in their food qualiti  their chip start to becom thinner and not so fresh  their beef didnt tast as good  and when they start post nutrit info onlinei was afraid veri afraid    most of my favorit dish here had a gazillion calori  oh no

wel everi onc in a while ill visit an old friend and have a beef burrito  was at this locat recent and enjoy one for lunch  noth special though

wil i return  possibli chop yo chicken i chop yo chicken into small chunk i dont minc yo chicken i just chop into tini juici piec this is the reason whi the egg drop soup with minc chicken didnt suck unlik most restaur which tend to abus their chicken capitol seafood joy did chicken right like your gam gam make homemad chicken soup but not everybodi is your gam gam and most tend to abus their chicken becaus chicken is so lean it lead to dri bland chicken bit that you will choke on i just want to put choke and chicken in the same sentence

th spici and probabl sour shrimp was decent but not stellar although they did do a standup job on prep those onyern onion which was slice thin  most chines restaur will just quarter the onion slackers

also order the tau miu which was your standard garlic pea shoot veget dish noth like your leafi green veget to keep you regular this might be good for you if your one of those peopl that disappear for an hour or so with a magazin under your arm fyi  im innout in record time the secret is leafi greens

th last dish was some beef dish with a generic indistinct flavor that whi ill generic just say it was decent

th reason whi i tri this place out is becaus i cant stand get screw with all the high price hype up crap on the strip instead i like my crap off the strip speak of crap those leafi green i had earlier is work their magiccame to tea station for the first time last week never been to a tea station before
ord a mango frozen drink and butter toast
thi place is realli popular at night and a lot of peopl come here to hang out with friends
not sure if it worth come back to tri more thing but im open to that idea
lot of drink and food to choos from not sure on quality
indooroutdoor seat casual
br an open mindmy gal pal and i decid to stop here after dinner to get a boba drink i had not been here previous and was a bit nervous as to what i should order i was pray that i did not order a boba drink that i may not like and that would be disappointing

luckili i final decid on the rose milk with boba after review the menu which has a lot of beverag options

mi drink was the perfect amount of sweet and i truli enjoy it which was realli like a perfect dessert after just have ramen for dinner

th price are for sure high for what you get my small rose milk with boba was 575 which is more expens than my favorit larg drink at starbuck ouch

i will be back after i hit the lotteri or a vega jackpot so that way i can order a larg drink to enjoyquestion where can you buy a cheap beer in vega without have to spend all your money at the tabl wait for a waitress to come take your order 

answer 7eleven

quest can you drink your purchas beer on the street

answ of cours after all your in vega veri few rule appli in the citi of sinwhat we call 4 taco at 74th street baptist church we call a sinnysinsin 

3 is the most i would ever pay for a taco so how did i end up pay 4 each for 3 here oh the top are extra yep extra on top of an alreadi overpr co lord know how they figur out what what 15 here 35 there 07 around the corner 27 for a bag 

this whole experi was a mess i tri to get all three taco without sour cream and 23 end up with it my veggi taco end up be carnita and 4 it took 12 min at the window to get my food the wrong salsa was in the bag oh and the taco were 4 each three taco shouldnt cost more than 2 burrito 

the three star is bc natur they were delici 2 for the price and wack job servic even for a drive through next time im head to taco el gordowent to lunch on a friday afternoon here sinc i have been to taco el gordo so mani time i want to give these guy anoth tri sinc the first time was the taco trek uye month ago thank nelson q

i was pretti hungri so i was think the standard carn asada burrito would fill me up base on the taco i got last time if you  refer to my pic the burrito was not all that big in fact if you dont tell them you want it with everyth which is chees guacamol and sour cream for an extra 150 all that in there is just the meat and bean so for 575 you get a tini burrito add the 150 just so you can a littl more stuf in it i paid a total of 784 with tax now i dont know about you guy but lot of other place would give you a huge burrito for that price so yes i was a bit disappointed

whil i was eat i notic a major of the patron were caucasian weird if you go to taco el gordo it main mexican so what am i miss are you tell me that los taco is more of an american establish dont get me wrong to me there noth wrong with that it just didnt look right 

some other thing i notic they dont have a salsa bar they do have salsa verd in squeez bottl on just about everi tabl i guess you have to ask them for other sauc on the side if you dont like the green sauc which i thought is pretti good

next coupl of visit i will tri the shrimp cevich tostada becaus i saw somebodi order it and scarf it down i was so tempt to interrupt their first bite just so i can ask to take a pictur of it lolexplor the citi german fare the bf and i head over to cafe heidelberg the past friday even  upon enter the waitress look at us and then the clock  i ask if they were close and she said no but we had five minut to order  i guess the last seat is definit at 8 pm

walk past the small market and into the back we seat ourselv into a quaint littl booth  a bunch of older folk fill the other tabl and you get the feel that this is definit a famili kind of place  hofbrauhaus and cafe heidelberg are in two total differ leagues

th waitress hand us the menus and a beverag list  the food menu is veri basic noth fanci at all  and the beverag list has a decent varieti of beer and wine  

i want spatzl and that all i care about  so i order one of the few thing that came with spatzl  the jagerschnitzel 23 pork schnitzel light batter and smother in a mushroom  wine and onion sauc  pair with red cabbag and spatzel

th bf was torn between the mix wurst plate 23 bratwurst knackwurst and bockwurst  serv on a bed of sauerkraut and mash potato and the oktoberfest platter 25 a classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo bratwurst pair perfect with red cabbag and homemad spatzl  he chose the former sinc i alreadi had the pork schnitzel and spatzl in my dish

a we wait for our entre bread and butter arriv with our beverag  we also took a littl walk through the market to check out their german groceri and deli  a limit choic of food item but youll find your herring spatzel and sauerkraut avail here for home

mi pork schnitzel was cover with dark brown gravi and was quit tender  pretti good  the spatzel was okay but mayb it becaus i prefer it with a creamier sauc instead like mushroom  i think i should have order the kase spatzl 16 hous recip german noodl smother with melt swiss chees  garnish with tomato instead  the red cabbag was blah noth special but the side salad was pretti tasti  

the bfs wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauc for dip and a huge help of sauerkraut  the differ wurst were pretti good and the sauerkraut was okay  then again i think im a fan of it on the colder end and crunchi than soggy

they were both veri generous order and we had leftov to go  we never made it to dessert which was bavarian appl strudel with vanilla sauc 7 and black forest cherri cake 5  

overal cafe heidelberg may probabl be more authent german fare than hofbrauhaus  they were recent vote best of las vega for other ethnic restaur again  so if you want your german fix head on over to cafe heidelberg just dont expect the loud music crazi game and the long wait of it competitor

i ad pic of our dinner in the busi profilin a larg yet hidden plaza rest komol a quaint thai eateri with great lunch special  the interior is cozi and cover in veri pretti purpl fake flower  the paint on the wall and other knickknack all show a lot of thai pride and are set up quit well as to not clutter your dine experience

i came in with a friend for lunch on a monday for the lunch special  there are mani option and all come with an egg roll and a soup or salad  go with the salad sinc the peanut sauc is amaz  just the right amount of sugar and salt  the veget soup was bland and forgett   

i order the panang curri with tofu my friend got the indian curri with chicken  i ask for the panang extrem spici but it came out mild  the curri was a littl chalki and need to be cook a bit longer or need more water  the indian curri was spici and tasti  

the menu is veri larg and i would come back to tri a few more item even though the one i had were noth special  

the biggest short come of this place is the time it take for your food to get to the tabl  it wasnt busi at all and we still wait a good twenti minut after our soupsalad arrivit is with a heavi heart that i downgrad my belov komol  i love the place so much that i had been look past all the slipup the last few month but i final decid enough was enough  if i had the same experi the first time i visit i would have never come back

sinc at least decemb thing have been fall apart  mani time the food qualiti just wasnt there the herbal salad was miss all the flavor it use to have or the tofu was fri into someth unrecogniz  order were put in wrong  and everi singl time the servic was just nonexist  the server are still friend enough but there were time we wait well over 40 minut for our food to come out or 15 minut for a check  onc we were in the restaur for two hour just tri to have a simpl quick dinner

and pleas let just put it out there the place is in need of a good scrubbing

i still love you komol but you need some time to work on youin a citi with some incred restaur and dine experi how the heck did i end up here for lunch the quick answer is that i was work for a cheapskat which mean mari callendar has good price for their meals

our server was superfriend and brought us a basket of fresh bread with honey butter yum i notic our tabl was a bit sticki which alway result in an automat onestar deduct i order a turkey croissant club sandwich with a side of fruit  the sandwich was actual quit good although the fruit was on the hardunrip side my dine companion were a bit annoy with my croissant which spray flake across the tabl with each bite

it was a decent meal but noth memor exact what youd expect from a mari callendar they do make incred pie here but i left without have a slice on this day i heard about this place through a bank teller that hada sign in front of his window that portray his favorit food burger so i ask what the best burger youv had here in vega he repli at the seven sea it in the ghetto the loui burger tell me what you think

plac wasnt as bad as i thought i walk in the food side entranc the other went straight to the barloung look up at the menu and saw the burger surround by a whole lotta southern lovin comfort food item mmmmmmmmmmmmm but that time i was there for one thing only

loui burger plump bun thick stubbi patti red onion tomato lettuc came with a mound of fri the burger had a nice char quit juici tender that familiar home grill flavor but a littl too salti for my tast remind me of a smash burger and a gorden biersch burger at same time the fri were decent but a littl over greas in my opinion 

extra friend and corteous staff price were fair cash onli locat wasnt that bad dine area cozi the barloung was play some smooth jazzrb jam nice look like a popular african american hang out burger and fri were decent overal i may comeback to have their catfish or chickenthis is my third or perhap fourth toni roma restaur that i have been to around the world it was way less crowd than the bangkok locat light seem brighter than the one in fremont ca and i cant recal at all the locat of the other chain outpost i have been to

th menu still have some of the regular old school item but it has definit been revamp in the last 68 year sinc i ate at a toni roma the steak  wild mushroom flatbread in the appet section and the basil pesto mahi mahi  veget linguin in the pasta section both look realli good which i have to tri next time

but here my review on what i order for dinner on this visit

i was crave the origin back rib with the trs origin bbq sauc which came with cole slaw and i opt for the load mash potato as the other side item  it came out of the kitchen befor i could finish read a page out of a book i brought with me  was told it was becaus they were slow  so who know how long it has been wait in the kitchen to be serv  the full slab of rib look kind of small it didnt even cover the length of the oval plate and i knew i would have to order more food  the flavor was good but the rib didnt match my fond memori of it  elli island rib is definit the way to go for me while i am in vega  rib 253 stars

ord a chop wedg salad after the rib arriv and as simpl as it was it was a highlight of the dine experi the rice pilaf was the other  crazi i know  4 stars

from the seafood section i order the norwegian salmon pan sear with sesam crust and finish with thai sweet chili sauc it was serv with great rice pilaf and steam broccoli  the fish was prepar well but it would have been better if it was not cook all the way through  3 star the best part of this item is your abil to custom your salmon or mahi mahi and the cook method and finish options

servic was friend and attent  there were onli 3 tabl my waiter was respons for and onli 2 at the most were in the restaur at the same time so it wasnt hard to check up on the guest and bring refills

they also have a full bar but i didnt order anyth interest from them

ambiancedecor 35  had some pictur and such as wall decor the light at the booth were fair bright which i like for take food pictur and music play in the background  nice feel but noth special

servic  45  pleasant

food  35  portion is notic smaller with the rib flavor still the same but the salad was refresh and tasty

pric  35  compar to other casual dine competit and has option that will meet the need of those on a modest budget under 15person and other that can slight splurg a littl more

dur lunch they have the 7 for 7 promot and their happi hour are from 3pm to 7pm and also from 9pm to close

loc  west  not at all close to the strip so it is for locals

park  plenti to select from as it is in a larg strip mall complex with sever larg nation retail such as best buy

3 star  but the rib will no longer be the reason for my futur visitok so i was in the mood for authent mexican food today and want to tri someth newso i head toward the hood  i figur id find someth good there

a i pass by pepe ive seen this place a 1000 time sinc ive live in vega but never stop  i did today

it was pretti busi in the restaur and i was glad to see a typic menu for a taco shopremind me of when i live in socal  i order a carn asada burrito and a bottl of mexican orang sodai love their soda becaus it made with natur sugar and not high fructos corn syrup

anyway my burrito came out and i was pleas to see it was a good sizenot too big and not too small  i went to the salsa bar and got some of their spici red salsa  the burrito was oki thought the carn asada was too salti but it had good flavorth bean were goodth rice was dryand the salsa in the burrito was ok

overal the experi didnt blow me away  it was a good visit but not the one i was hope for  i guess next time ill have to go deeper into the hood

wil i return  ehnot sureok so this is realli a fun review i am excit to add to my yelp collection

at approxim 2am in the morn my yelp buddi jon call and invit me for a bite out yes even though i was alreadi in bed relax watch tv i accept his invit as i am veri spontan and alway readi to stuff my mouth ok so i got dress he was at my hous in 15 or so minut and we were on our way head to pepes

i had eaten here onc befor preyelp day this time was most definit yelp worthi we were crave taco so taco we had

first off they are open 247 to satisfi our late night and earli morn munch cravings

th taco were good i order a chicken and asada soft taco plate which came with rice and bean my pal order birria soft taco which were delici i have never had marin goat meat he gave me a tast of his and those were yummi as well

remind me of the street and truck taco you can get in town definit better than the other more commerci mexican food joint around 

we had fun sit chat and grub although the food was great i still have mani other taco joint to check out

mmmm until the next mouth stuf rendezv i am out  peaci rememb when this was origin miller steakhous that place was no good but pepe took over year ago and it seem to have stuck be a fan of pepe in cali i was alway hesit about tri this place i didnt know if it was the same or complet differ with onli one way to find out i head on my way 

the park lot was pack i was lucki to nab the last spot it was busi insid i place my order and wait mayb 810 minut for my food i saw other wait too so i knew it might be a minut and they were cook it fresh i order the carn asada burrito and the chees quesadilla the tortilla are yummi the burrito was good in size and tast decent but wasnt spectacular the real winner was the quesadilla it was cheeeeeesi 

i notic a sign insid that said they onli accept cash howev the cashier ask me if i want to pay with cash or debit 

pepe is open 24 houri love mexican i mean mexican food

pep compar to roberto 

pepe knock this one out of the ball park the reason be the qualiti of food is way better i want it to be known that the staff here is veri friend mayb a littl to friend i had a guy in the back wink at me
also the first time i was here one of the employe actual ask me for my number at that time 2010 i was singl and to this day i still talk to him as a good friend

overal you can order anyth with the carn asada and it will be great the carn asada is fine chop and has veri minim fat they season their meat veri well not to salti nor to bland the add a side of bean and tortilla chips

th onli thing i would do differ is keep the salsa station cleani give this place 35 star  i live veri close by and opt to go here or even order out  good sushi  havent had a bad experi here yet  the staff is veri friendly

mi favorit dish here are

th volcano roll which is a bake california roll top with scallop and mayo and roll up in salmon

th tuna karai sashimi which is an awesom japanes version of hawaiian poke

and the johnni roll a delici light shrimp tempura wrap in cucumber

besid the all you can eat they also have bento box avail  

overal a great place to eat sushi on the northwest side yike what happen to macaroni grill i use to love come here 

we did get seat right away but get acknowledg by our server after be seat was anoth stori they seem veri busi 

after quench my thirst becaus i final got my drink order was under way i ask for a hous salad with extra ranch to start then for my meal i order the build your own pasta it was noodl arrabbiata sauc and buffalo mozzarella the server brought me a caesar salad instead if the hous salad i order then brought the right salad after i was almost finish with my pasta 

the food was good but servic was lack veri much 

it was clean insid and they just finish a remodel so they now have both booth and tabl to sit at 

they still have the curbsid to go if you want to phone in an order to go

outsid is a nice patio should you feel like eat outdoorthis wendi is an okay locat  it isnt the best or the worst just averag  let me tell you whi if you realli want to know

1  the food here is usual good  the burger are alway great  i heart the bacon  i mean it is burger bacon and chees without anyth to distract from meat and chees heaven  yum  i know it is probabl the worst thing on the menu but i love it anyway  when the crave hit off to wendi i go  the other sandwich are alway good too  and the chicken nugget are alway great snacks

wher this wendi get a lower rate is due to the fri and the frosti or is it frosti  both are alway a crapshoot  sometim the fri are fresh hot and amaz and some time they tast so blah  the frosti are usual good but everi now and then they tast like they forgot to add sugar or someth  if these 2 item could be more consist my score would go up for sure

2  the staff  sometim you get the best peopl help you which is alway so veri nice  and then there are the other one  one ladi who work here usual the drive thru is simpli ugh  she bark at you to order doesnt give you a minut to look if you ask for one and practic throw your food at you when you get up to the window  you are almost afraid to ask for some ketchup from her  

overal i think 75 of the staff is realli friend but if you go on the wrong day and get the other 25 then i am sorri for you

so most of the time this locat is good  my advic to you is to alway check your fri and frosti befor you leav to make sure you got good onefirst and foremost wal mart is the place to be when there are those night where you have noth to do and you are think of somewher to go and someth to snack on  the wal mart on this side of town though is open 24 hour but i dislik the whole park lot situat the lot is not at all organ and there are not ani stop sign where there need to be peopl zoom in and out of here so if you are ever die to go on a whimsic trip to wal mart on nelli pleas proceed with cautionwe realli like super mex  it has pretti decent tex mex offer and a pretti larg menu  they even have a discount and a lite menu for even more option  you are bound to find someth you like here

w start go to super mex when i found a few buy one get one coupon from the vega entertain book  i love a good coupon and the place was around the corner from where hubbi work so of cours we had to go  i am so happi we went too becaus the food is pretti yummi  it is good solid tex mex style food at reason prices

our favorit dish are the chimichanga gigant burrito taco and the flauta   i actual get the chimi 8 out of 10 time that we go becaus they are so addict  you can even get them enchilada style mean cover in red enchilada sauc and chees which is simpli amaz  my hubbi is the same way with the taco  yummy

on top of the menu item you also get chip salsa and bean dip  the chip are actual tostada that you break apart and scoop the yummi onto  the salsa at super mex is realli good too  it doesnt tast like your averag salsa from other place  it is darker in color and has differ layer of flavor  tasti  and the bean dip rock  i usual finish it off befor my hubbi and daughter can even get a bite  hey you snooz you lose when there is bean dip on the tabl next to me

th servic here is hit and miss though  sometim you get awesom servic and sometim not  that is whi i wen with 3 star  the food is easili 4 star and is pretti consist in my opinion

so see you at super mex  i will be the one stuf my face with a chimichangai current view mcdonald as more of a restaur serv inexpens snack than meal in my opinion mcdonald is a level or few below the fast food powerhous star in n out rais cane and panda express when dinner is far in the horizon and i want to calm my appetit i order off the mcdonald 1 menu as i look forward to a better meal the 1 menu featur larg fountain coke beverag a sausag buritto a hot  spici chicken sandwich a doubl cheeseburg  small coffe and other foods

   both my checkin here were when i hike on the angel park trail system this mcdonald is conveni to the angel park trail system which includ the bonanza trail kellogg sport complex and lone mountain trail the restaur is a conveni respit from outdoor activ to reach this mcdonald from the angel park trail system from bonanza trail which is realli the east spur of angel park trail to youd walk past the kellogg sport complex walk under the buffalo drive tunnel and after the kmart turn left on lone mountain trail after cross washington avenu with a pedestrian signal youd turn left and mcdonald is on the right

  as far as locat  i am curious whi mcdonald pass over build the restaur at the corner of buffalo at washington the exist restaur a few thousand feet east of buffalo drive on washington avenu is out of sight line for motorist drive on buffalo drive one traffic signal north of summerlin parkway then again be mcdonald there is anoth locat a coupl of traffic light north at buffalo and lake mead boulevard  

  this is an older mcdonald this is not surpris consid it is near kmart there is no theme just a basic mcdonald with a dine and indoor playground area

  the two checkin in this basic mcdonald were for a snack on my first checkin  i quaf down the limit time chocol strawberri frape it was a yummi caffein boost at a cost of 4 and 600plus calori fortun this was the halfway point of my hike and id burn some of it off on my followup checkin  i snack on a hot  spici chicken with a larg coke the coke was flat that is a no no if the servic wasnt decent and there wasnt a manag presenc this review would fall flat of 3 star and sink to 2 star 

  i tri to review place when i am a regular now that i am a duke that will probabl see that status fade at this locat it is time to emphas that this is a decent restaur for a snack or light meal off the angel park trail system and in the vicin of washington at buffalostop by this starbuck after a lunch at northsid nathan pizza which is a few door down  i enjoy come to starbuck to studi and get some work done  the free wifi is a big plus for me

although ive been to this starbuck befor it was the first time ive been here to studi and work  i like how they still serv decaf after 1 pmwhen most starbuck in vega stop brew it at 1 pm for some reason  i like my halfcafand cant do full blown caffein starbuck  i like how their free wifi gave me no problem it was fast and i stay connect for over 2 hoursunlik some other starbuck where the connect sucks

i didnt like the arrang of the furnitur  although the chair i was sit in was plush and comfi the atmospher didnt feel comfort to memayb it the feng shui of the joint  i dont have a clue about feng shui but someth just doesnt feel right in this place and i dont know how to explain itwhich is too bad

wil i return  for the halfcaf yesto studywork nothis is an ok port of sub locat  my hubbi love port of sub so we eat at them regular all over town whenev he get the crave  some are yucki some fantast but this locat is right down the middl  the staff at this locat are veri hit and miss  some are friend and welcom and some seem bother you are make them work  the store is clean but look like it need a littl refresh with mayb a coat of paint or new floor or someth to updat the interior  

i am bore and alway get the 1 i call it the italian meat buffet becaus it is load with pepperoni salami capicolla ham and provolon on bread and it is fantast  i am drool just think about it  i am kind of antiveggi so i go with just the meat chees pickl extra mustardmayo spread and all of the season  it is tasty

mi hubbi alway get the 2 which is the turkey ham and chees  he love it and is alway a happi camper afterward  i guess we just know what we like

i like how everyth is slice fresh for your order  the veggi even though i dont eat them all look fresh and much nicer than the veggi at subway  the bread is alway flaki and fresh and tast great  they alway have a huge select of side as well with about 10 chip type cooki and browni  i am just happi with my jalapeño chip though and realli havent tri the other item  my hubbi like their cooki and browni though and he get at least 1 everi time we are there

overal if you want a sandwich quick this is a great locat to grab one and gook bk realli now im not one of those littl food snob and im a cheap beezi so after pay outta my butt for my car here is where i came for a littl treat

i onli came for a ice cream sunda after saver and i went through the drive through now they recent remodel this place and it like stupid the way they put the exit right by the exit onto lake mead you would think they wouldv made the open big enough to enter and exit ala there is a sign to not turn into the drive thru ok sooooo if your go to tri and enter after leav chase saver or ani of those place you technic are suppos to go all the way around to enter i was like wtf and just went through anyway bc i had alreadi pull half way in so i proceed to order my ice cream and the guy was ok not amaz or super nice just ok servic was quick but he gave me a dumb look when i ask him for a cup holder for 3 sunda and a cup of water hello bro i dont have 4 cup holder 

anywho ice cream was yummi as usual and servic was semi quick not bad just a weird drive thru entranc and a huge slope go down the drive thru haha ill prob come back i do love their 1 sundai usual go to the walgreen that closer to my hous but today i was near this one and decid to stop by and pick up some dove dark chocol candi for the better half  it is her birthday today and one of her favorit thing is dove dark chocolate

i can count on walgreen to be abl to provid me the awesom that will make me a hero for today  sinc she had to work on her birthday i thought id surpris her with some of these bad boy and anoth one of her favorites

th roll are veri mediocr and dont even tri the spici tunasalmon bowl it basic a roll with more rice the sashimi is veri fresh but it such a small dish to wast a whole order on sinc you onli get to choos 3 item the chicken teriyaki bowl was veri tasti but it hard to go wrong with chicken teriyaki

dont get me wrong it a great deal but you get what you pay for  i still have hope for this place so ill continu to dine here for lunch when i crave sushi next time mayb ill grab a noodl dish make sure to checkin with the mobil yelp app for the 10 off 45 on your bill

mi boyfriend and i came on a friday night around 12am and it was pack i heard and read good thing about this place so whi not their happi hour menu is pretti good with halfoff on their select nigiri and simpl roll they had a larg hous sake for 450 dure happi hour

decor small pack loud clean kind of regret not grab a seat at the sushi bar faster servic that way

w order a few roll johnni that what she say to start it took 3040 minut to get 3 roll type by the end of the night we had 6 roll hous sake and two order of gyoza in an hour and 40 minutes

th fish was flavor fresh rich and delici pretti generous on the fish as well present was beauti the sauc were drizzl with care on our roll the sushi itself tantal our tast bud 

it a bit pricey sinc it all ala cart and we know it not allyoucaneat for a nonayc joint we expect mayb faster servic despit the qualiti roll they came out at a snail pace that we kept get hungri in between finish each roll dish we felt a bit sorri for the lone waitress do everyth from clean tend to other custom get side dish order etc she was do her best to serv everyon though mayb the servic wouldnt have suffer as much if they had anoth waitresswait or mayb an extra chef dont get me wrong we didnt expect them to come out with our order immedi but it took forev to get each one  

for the price we paid around 80ish by the end of the night just between the two of us i kind of wish we chose anoth place it was a delici meal just notsogreat time on the sushi i dont mind pay for sushi but if im pay quit a bit extra for an ala cart place i expect a bit better in term of timeli mayb well come back and tri it again on less busi nightwith the high review i realli want to love this place i did and i kept come back hope thing would chang with the custom servic and wait time for food but it never did see the end of my review for whi 

the first time we came for happi hour and got huge slice of fish veri generous we then went back again and this time the fish slice were liter cut in half the size it was the first time servic was sllllllooooowww and we had to ask for them to check on thing ask for water refil but my main gripe was that the fish slice reduc in half i would appreci them keep thing fair consist if it larg slice or small either way i know what i would get 

i do like the qualiti of the fish and so i would alway tri to convinc my hubbi to come back and each time i liter had to convinc my husband that thing would get better in term of the wait time for food sometim we just dont have 2 12 3 hour to wait for our food 

we came here onc on a major holiday and onc on my birthday so that show you how much i realli like their fish but i start to feel like i was just be hope by keep come back hope thing would get better we also came about 5 other time 

the last visit was my most memor in a bad way we order tuna regular on the first order and had a convers with our waitress and she told us how blue fin tuna was much better and we should get it we said we would think about it she said if you order all of our differ type of tuna and have them side by side and compar tast you would notic the differ we then later ad in blue fin tuna with a differ waitress becaus our was too busi to talk to us for about the 10 minut we tri flag her down the regular tuna arriv at the tabl we were hope to get them togeth but after wait and wait we never got the blue fin so we just ate that first tuna regular  more wait and wait and got some other order we got anoth plate of tuna it look exact the same as the first but what do we know mayb it was differ  it tast the same as the first we were confus we ask our waitress whi it tast exact the same when she claim they tast differ and she went to go check on it and after some long convers with the sushi chef and waitress she came back and said that i had order anoth order of regular tuna i said no we order the blue fin tuna per your suggest we werent impress with the regular tuna and that is whi we order the blue fin she kept insist that i order the regular and i kept insist i did not becaus that is true this went on with her talk about it with eric the sushi chefown and the 2 waitress involv it start to get uncomfort for me watch it all she then come back and say if you want to order it it past the happi hour time but we can offer it at the happi hour price ummmm no thank i alreadi order it befor an hour ago we are done eat alreadi spent over 100 and so over it at this point whi not just bring us the correct tuna that i order especi sinc they know us by face eric even came over and said he recogn us when i mention that we have been here mani time 

it just upset me that they made such a big deal about it instead of just give me what i order the waitress insist i was wrong and made it known make for a realli awkward date night with my husband it was also the waitress that kept say there is noth she can do it not her restaur and she is sorri but that is the decis she kept apolog for what happen but like i said we were done eat and just readi to go not want to argu over fish 

the owner could see us talk and he final came over long after we had alreadi been talk about this for an extend period of time which i just want want to drop it at this point i expect more from a place with high review and wish he would have taken the matter into his hand from the start onc he realiz there was a problem in the end he remov the second order of regular tuna and made it seem like he was accommod us it was the right thing to do but we still never got the blue fin tuna we order to each his own and he is the owner if he feel this is how to treat regular custom that is his choic unfortun after come here regular for about a year we decid that we want to feel a littl more appreci as custom i think the problem could have been fix quick even if the waitress did not admit it was her fault instead of drag it out and make for an uncomfort dine out experi 

the fish is 4 star 5 star tast 4 star size of nigiri 
the custom servic to me is 0 staras someon from the south the las vega bbq scene has alway been a sourc of disappoint most bbq place are comic bad both in term of the meat itself and oftentim more so in term of the side so i went to the road kill grill with pretti low expect 

mi expect were great exceed the food here is definit passabl and i think this place more than earn it best vega bbq reput befor i get to the pros let me explain quick whi i took off two stars

1 onli outdoor seat in vega let me tell you someth about the averag bbq eater they are fat peopl when it 100 degre outsid they go into hibern like a grizzli bear they dont want to sit outsid when eat their bbq

2 the servic was pretti slow there were onli 3 peopl in front of me when i got in line and get the food still took about 25 minut i dont mind a wait especi when the food is good but this delay was clear due to under staffinginexperi as all the food was readi it just need to be dish out more effici the design of their servic line leav much to be desir a littl rearrang so that more than 1 person could get involv and this problem would be instant solvedservic would speed up 10x 


the food

i got a 3 meat plate the highlight was definit the sausag in bbq sauc which was veri flavor the rib were definit a littl on the dri side but still quit good for vega the brisket sit in a vat of liquid so it was moist but a littl toughneed to be slow cook longer the mac and chees was veri decent but the bake bean were way to vinegari for my taste

i will definit be go back although mayb in winter and check out the butcher product as welli have to take off a star and hope i dont have to take anymor 

part of the reason whi it was comfort to be here is the night time staff was friend and attent we sat in our usual tabl and even though the bartend was stuck behind a bar he still walk over and ask period if were still do alright

 the bf and i went in and there was a bunch of new staff we walk up to the bar to order to go last week sinc we didnt feel like hang out and have beer the bartend and the bar back ignor us a good 510 or so minut even though they were not busi they were even have a convers direct in front of us and ignor that im look right at them i was just sit there like wtf and debat on leav if anoth 5 more minut elapse

 there was a girl who seem to have come up to the comput to check someth she was on her break and she stop midway walk away and ask if we need someth sinc i probabl look cranki sit there she put in our ticket and put the check in front of us i put my card and the whole time the bartend never acknowledg us never came by to take my card hes even joke around and danc to the music but no time to payout my bill 

even when our food was readi he just hand us the bag my bill still wasnt paid becaus he didnt want to take it the 20 minut i was there wait for my order good thing im a honest person so i wave my card to be taken instead of chees it then he went to the comput and rang up 2 other peopl first gave them all their paper befor get to me who was the onli togo order need to get home befor my food get cold 

ugh i sure hope this guy isnt the new regular night bartend becaus he doesnt know how to time manag nor the abc of servic if the next time i come in and it the same guy and none of the waitress are work im walk back out serious i wont scratch my eye out to get servic at a place i rave about as a friend attent neighborhood barthis is a great altern to store bought pizza it tast fresh ad take half the amount of time to cook compar it to a local joint or domino and i say this isnt as good just my opinion

cal ahead and order it for a quicker experi sign up for their deal i love their valentin and halloween pizza which are shape like heart or pumpkin pretti neat 

i like that if you go in person to order you can watch them make your pizza with the fresh ingredi noth to hide

custom servic was okay they look like they hate their job poor fellow 

the last few time i was here they were super busi becaus they accept ebt noth wrong with peopl on it but it made it super pack near the begin of the monthtaco bellmi favorit place to grab a quick bite when im short on cash in the wallet  my son enjoy a bunch of menu item here but im a simpl guy  90 of the time i get 2 bean burrito sometim i order a 7 layer burrito  

this locat alway has fresh ingredi and alway has quick accur servic  it nestl between sun citi summerlin which is a retir communiti and the origin summerlin which is a littl over 20 yrs oldso there rare a long line or wait here

wil i return  im sure i willthis bk is near my hous and i get coupon booklet in the mail often i wouldnt eat here as much if i didnt have the coupon the burger are fast food averag and the veggi are usual fresh the worker are nice but the wait time can be brutal often i do like the cinnabon option they have i just dont like when they put in the box and bag upsid down so that when i open it the frost isnt everywher but on the bunwhile on lunch break from work i decid to check out fazoli again after my first experi about six year ago at anoth location

noth has chang other than the price go up up and up and the flavor go down down and down

i order the 8 which cost 979 it is penn with creami basil chicken and a slice of pizza wsmall drink the pasta dish i did not eat becaus the balsam tomato were just too overpow and the pasta be the main cours of my lunch i was truli disappoint the slice of pizza was actual veri good and i began think that i should have just order the two slice of pizza combo instead 

anyway i did contact a store supervisor later to inform of the bitter tast pasta and she did advis it was most like that they ad too much balsam to it which could have ruin it

sh was a sweetheart and put my name in the credit book as that i may return and get a replac meal to make up for the bad pasta dish i had 

the bread stick were tasti and flavorful

i will give them anoth shot as i realli think i just order the wrong pasta dish at the wrong timeive realiz there just arent ani hole in the wall chines restaur here in vega with the same kind of raucous atmospher and cheap eat back in nyc or sf  but if i can get preferenti treatment without have to speak in cantones im happi  base on first impress the attent alreadi seem better than at hk star   how can i forget the smell the greas on the wall  agh

thi may not be a fair review sinc we didnt order ani entre  seafood dish are usual how i measur great cantonesehk style food  me and andi t had a late night snack and share the salt fish and chicken fri rice which was good  ive had this serv casserol style and the tradit way and some chines restaur dont even have this on their regular menu  i suppos it the innout secret menu of fri rice at certain places

overal 3 star for now  i would come back again becaus i think if you order the right thing here there room for improvthis place has been open for so long it might have been my first ayc sushi too i use to go here to satisfi my crave for ton of sushi until i discov sushi mon which is closer to my work this place still hold true though the last time i went the fish was still fresh and the roll were still delici the onli complaint about this restaur now is the locat and the size of the place the bathroom arent all that clean eithersushi on rainbow is not go to win ani award for be the nicest or newest look sushi restaur in las vega but it is a good sushi restaur with some of the more entic promot  can you say all you can drink  and i am not even a drinker  anyway this aycd promot is valid dure dinner time on sunday and monday  which is a great deal when you onli have to pay the regular 2695 dinner ayc price  hous sake or bud light are the alcohol you can get with this deal or coke sprite or ice tea for the nonalchies

i came here for dinner as part of an event setup by a sushi group on meetup although our entir parti was asian from various countri the restaur seem to attract a broad spectrum of custom which is alway nice to see

lik just about all the ayc sushi restaur in town uni ama ebi are limit to one order per person even though you will not find them on the ayc menu  but their select of nigiri and roll are enough to fill both side of their ayc menu and if the chef are not super busi they will make whatev you want as long as they have the ingredi on hand my new favorit is masago with quail egg on top of cook shrimp which is a fanci version of the masago and quail egg that i typic order  thank sushi chef for pimp my roll 

their pepper tuna nigiri was good  the tiger roll too

decor 35  simpl show some age

servic 455  the waitress did their best look after all the custom in the restaur  plate were clear quick sake and beer order were deliv prompt  sushi chef did their best prepar all the order our group of ten was send their way

loc  corner of spring mountain and rainbow same plaza as greenland supermarket  not too far if you are cab it from the the wynn and nearbi casino otherwis it is pretti much for locals

food  355anoth yelper said they were give out 10 free wing to new reward card member so i decid to take full advantage

i sign up for the reward card  got a funbook it gave me 100 free slot playi lost 10 free wing and 2 for 1 beer so i went to hooter had some wing and a steak sandwich the food was decentgood meati hot wing i had them 3 mile island styleth atmospher was incred and the price was just right 20 wing steak sandwich4 beer less than 20
there is a littl bit of a wait sinc this place is pack but they have lot of tvs and the pool has a bar and firepitsgood foodlimit menu but good price so close to the strip
hoot girl arent what they use to be all the girl here look under 21 and they arent so scntili clad as most cocktail waitress in other casinos
th steak sandwich wasnt charbroil but it was still fair good the wing were big and juici wit ha littl crunch i like them
th pool  the porch is the best seat in the hous there lot of tvs everywher to make sure you can catch the game from ani seat in the housyou get what you pay for bf and i came here for a 3 night stay in the middl of the week and i think each night was 20 buck plus resort fees

it not too far from the strip plus we drove there so we could easili get to the strip 

free valet if you must we just park on our own and avoid tip everi time we went to and from the car 

the room are averag theyr clean 

except on the 2 morn when they were do construct right across the hall and next to our room at 7am are you serious i was furious

i went to complain at the front desk and all they would do is waiv 2 night of resort fee serious whi did you put us on a floor with construct and it went on for hour the guy next door to us was piss too

definit minus 1 star esp becaus they were so nonchal about it too unapologet basic they didnt give a rat booti 

overal im ok with this hotel it just that incid that make me protest a littl about return but for the price sigh i guess ill suck it up zzzzzzzyes the room are old  the internet access is extrem slow and patchi in place  servic vari with stellar perform by the male pool bartend gave us a tip of all the frozen drink hooter serv the rum punch has the most alcohol versus the pina colada which has almost none and lack perform by the femal bartend insid the hooter restaur not even a smile  what up with that

however

1 summer special when book onlin  32 for the night not includ resort fee about 14 and tax  this included
a two free frozen alcohol drink 
b platter of 10 free wings
c 10 free slot play 
d 10 free match play

2 sign up for a free card to play in the casino necessari for your free slot play and youll get anoth coupon for 5 free match play and 5 free price of a beer at the restaurant

3 check in offer at the bar  a free beer of your choic if you check in on facebook or twitter  sit at the bar and everyon in your parti can check in apparently

4 sign up for text messag from hooter and guess what anoth free plate of 10 wings

5 sit at the bar when it almost showtim and there a possibl a hypnotist will run by and hand you two free tickets

so overal we made more money off hooter dure this trip than they made off us this is my first time to vega but im pretti sure this isnt how it suppos to work 

definit worth a stay if your a fan of good financi decisyou are greet when you walk in and sat at a tabl 
they will then take your order 
you will get your order within 510 minut 

awesome

but dont expect to see them again for the remaind of your meal this is how most vietnames restaur oper but this locat doe it much more appar 

there is a sign in front that say pleas pay here this save the restaur staff the close step of servic which is to bring out your bill 

i understand whi they do this howev it make pay the bill and leav a tip a less person experi 

the restaur is usual alway busi which make eat here somewhat of an experi but other than thatconsid this a fast casual spotbuffet  asia is a place that has never peak my interest until recent when a famili member rave about their sunday dinner    

come sunday and you have three raven individu who just came from bike outsid in the 107 degre vega weather  yeah were crazy

w walk in around 5 pm and there alreadi a line  straight to the regist 1599pp adult and were seat at a tabl  

there a mongolian bbq station  you pick your veggi and meat and they cook it up on this giant flat stove thing for you  we all skip this which might explain whi we never saw the kalbi short rib everyon els talk about damn

sushi  they have a bunch of random roll with lot of sauc and stuff and some salmon sashimi  that was someth we all avoid as well

seafood  green mussel bake scallop my friend wasnt sure if there was scallop in there bc they mix it up with stuff and cover it up with sauc jumbo hot shrimp old cook cold shrimp fresh and not over cook  over by the salad bar section oyster on the half shell big one  okay a bit too milki for me lobster salt and pepper crab not the freshest snow crab leg we most ate this and a lot of it with drawn butter deepfri frog leg old deepfri calamari okay bake salmon clam pretti good and im sure a few other thing i overlook  there was no crawfish though unfortunately

cook item  stirfri string bean i ate a lot of this mix veggi with shrimp beef and broccoli fri rice steam rice asparagus potstick skin was old crab ragoon eggrol deepfri chicken wing etc

soup  wonton soup oxtail soup egg drop soup

dessert  fresh fruit and marshmallow for dip into chocol egg custard tart blah almond cooki soft serv almond jello with fruit cocktail mango mouss sesam ball malasada would be better if they were hot tapioca and a few other things

servic is super attent especi in clear plate  they greet you right away with beverag order and it not to hard to wave them down for refil extra napkin shell cracker etc

overal you realli cant complain about the price  we went on one of their more expens night and i think we had enough crab to definit surpass our money worth  you have to wonder how they even turn a profit  some of the food is just blah but at least you can have a tast and never get more  and then there a hand of thing that will have you return for more  it work for picki eater too  their menu seem to be chang all the time so you never know what your gonna get  ive had better buffet that cost more and wors asian one too  they obvious are do someth right becaus there a lot of peopl dine heremy mom love this place and come here at least onc a month  i on the other hand think it just aok  there a nice select of food but it seem lack to me  here my  breakdown

 larg select of food  there plenti of option  they even have pizza although i dont recommend itit an asian buffet for pete sake

 decent servic  this place is alway busi and they usual keep up with the pace  food is general kept stock on the food line and the server keep the glass full

 food qualiti is ok for a buffet  it not great but hell it aycethi isnt the bellagio buffet

 price  the price use to be realli good but theyv been steadili increas price over the past coupl of yearsbut still 699 for a lunch buffet  that pretti cheap in my book

 park  park is a bitch when it busyit not the restaur fault though and my star rate doesnt reflect thisjust say fyi

overal it pretti good valu  if you dont like wait i suggest go in between meal period when it slower than peak times

return factor  75yeah i know a commerci establish which i normal dont visit howev this locat deserv a good yelp 

open 247 all donut fresh fri and glaze 

i walk in and look at the display rack of fresh donut liter saw them glisten with their generous fresh just glaze ice 

799 for a dozen well 14 donut to be exact not sure if that is standard or just becaus i walk in with two nice big plump donut of my own anyhow that is a steal for fresh moist melt in your mouth donut at 2am 

servic is great i mean realli i dont expect mind blow servic from a donut shop much less at 2am also doe not take much skill or thrill to fill a box with donut 

the gentleman work this particular earli morn shift had lot of spunk and vigor he is one with ton of person joke and told me my total was 7 million dollar you know those funni type realli refresh consid he work graveyard 

yay winchel s jone locat as i can not speak for the rest as a lot of them are franchis now 

this locat rockit has been over three year sinc i last drop in to blue ox tavern  and up until just a few second ago i was still complet uninform about the signific of blue ox except it has some connect to minnesota  so if you are curious about the name here is a brief cliff note notat about this trivia

blu ox is actual name babe and is paul bunyan anim companion

blu ox was also a profession roller hockey team base in minneapoli mn that use to play in the roller hockey intern league

but if you are expect the interior of the tavernsport bar to be all blue you will be disappoint  hue of light pink is what you will most like be cover with regardless of where you decid to park your hiney for the durat of your visit but dont worri your eye are veri good at filter that out but it could get problemat when you tri to take pictur of your food menu or other pictur worthi subject matter  

anyway i was here recent to catch the slight more than half of the most bore super bowl event in recent memori the place was fair busi but there were still a few tabl and booth that were unoccupi when i walk in  the averag age of the patron was easili over 35 and i am lowbal my guestim so if you are look for young wild and crazi sport bar scene this is probabl not your best bet  best surpris of the afternoon was the complimentari half time buffet that was sponsor by a local law firm the hot link and other sausag and side were a definit hit

their regular menu is your typic nongourmet bar food  you have your appet most fri item and nacho salad sandwich burger and breakfast item  i had a bowl of soup chang daili and one of their burger on both visit  food is decent and portion is relat larg but noth to rave about in our local week magazin and most item are under 10  

servic is decent the waitress check up on you regular so your refil or next order of beer is practic effortless  if you stop in to this sport bar when there are no game on you could save 1 with your yelp checkin off

overal i like this vintag sport bar that has persev through the year with the occasion event promot to draw in regular and snag a few newbi  good experi if you are look for someth differ from your regular routine

review 5 of 2014i am drive in vega in the mood for asian food 

so i drive out toward spring mountain where all the asian restaur are near valley view i have my gps work and for where to i pick food then asian it quick show me a list of choic and how far they are and in which general direct i scroll down look for someth to hit me just right then i see it

titt thai restaur 

wow this is vega my mind race with differ fantasi about what this place could be like with a name like that

1 a vega all nude joint that serv lap danc after your tom yum
2 infam thai strip joint where girl dont use their mouth to smoke a cigarett 
3 an off the vega strip dancedinn review with topless dancers
4 trendi club where panang curri isnt the hottest thing in the hous 

it is onli 1 mile away so i follow gypsi my gps to the coordin 

tipp thai restaur read the sign in front of a normal strip mall restaur in a dark part of the neigborhood

what did they get too mani drunk trucker want more than thai food that they chang the name too mani geek from the consum electron show want breast with their pad thai

wait a minut i thought tipp well that is and integr part of titt isnt it everi mammari has it nippl or it isnt realli mammalia 

or did my gps just have a typo i peer into the restaur it is pretti larg it is 800pm and nobodi is insid eat there is one car in the lot it look like a restaur for sure but somehow the titt or tipp monik hasnt help bring the custom after ponder a bit and strain to see some sign of life i drive off in search of an altern i am realli hungri now and get tire and grumpi 

marne thai show up nearbi a coupl of more car in the lot a few more custom insid by this time i am famish there a karaok stage and light to the right it seem this place is own by the omnipres chines diaspora how do i know well the owner look chines somehow but the sign outsid said marne thai chines food that was my best clue 

i order tom yum soup no lap danc came after but it was spici then panang curri with rice the onli thing steam was my curri and rice i had a sing ha to help cool off my burn tongu 

food was soso the soup i order medium hot but it was hothot with red and green chili and a lot of lemograss too the panang was just chicken and no veggi the chicken was all breast meat though 

realli nice breast no tipp but tender littl morsel in the mouthwe came here on a monday even and order 
1 chicken pad thai 899
2 chicken green curri 899
3 white rice 
for 22

 chines and thai restaur had to tri it
 nice littl stage for perform 
 friend servic we were the onli patron at the time they were eat dinner and from time to time would help serv us while eat we were watch their famili slide show on tv 
 food came to us in less than 10 min we were hungri and that was great
 pad thai had a bit too much flavor almost too much orang color first time i had a waitress ask us how hot would you like it 
 medium is pretti spici 
 rather than chicken beef and shrimp cost more money 
  green curri could use a bit more coconut and more chicken good amount of bamboo 
 spice rack was old and not fresh pepper were soft and almost empti 
 we got our rice for free 
 kinda slow at pick up check
 for the price i think it was pretti good usual when we get this combin of food we end up spend around 2530this is a serious late ass review better late and never right haha

i want dim sum the last time i was in vega and this was the place that i found on yelp and that a coupl friend that live in lv were familiar with

grant that it not the best dim sum restaur out there it decent some of the dish were realli good but after a while if you keep say no to the ladi and their cart they will stop come by which of cours was when i want someth so expect typic minim asian servic but they do come when flag down

th next time im there and crave dim sum im tri the other place pi do not have nostalg memori to inflat my rate of this busi be that i neither grew up on farm basket i imagin i would not be as strong and healthi if i had nor even ever heard of them in ani way befor step in to the lone remain area establish on account of need calori fast 

pro the calori are inde deliv to you fast serious no more than two minut after step through the open doorway i had my food in a tini white bag  seep greas from it in various spot  in my hand and on my way 

con the food provid was grossli overpr as well as fair unimpress if you are go to charg chickfila or rais cane price i expect it to be close to the same qualiti minus the unabash homophobia and jesus music play in the case of cfa

pro they are a nonchain busi  in a world of chain galor 

con they wont be an anytyp of busi if they keep salt their fri so heavili that they will singlehand kill all of their loyal clientel my blood pressur might have tripl succeed eat my small fri which had more salt on them than i have had in month combined

conclus their taglin is were carri away with qualiti the truth is that they are carri away with their use of salt do not recommend unless you are suffer from dilut hyponatremia  enevada chicken café cater my compani christma parti and man did they bring a ton of food

they do chickenrotisseregril chickena littl dri compar to el pollo loco but good non the less

they also had rib which were veri tough  dry

definit would not do the rib again

th side were a littl bland  boringmacncheesesom orang look rice and salads

they have great price so it may be worth check out again when it not cater but made to orderit a starbucksthey are pretti much all the same onli bonus is that is close to spanish hill so not a major driveneighborhood tavern and lodg make it an easi stop for a simpl lunch break

it was quiet on a wednesday as we were the onli one here for lunch  the waitress came out and got our beverag go as we check out the menu

i went for the grill chicken  avocado sandwich marin grill chicken breast fresh avocado swiss chees appl wood bacon red onion tomato and sprout  serv with mayo on a fresh bake roll 895  my sandwich was surpris realli good  the chicken was veri flavor and not dri at all  it was definit a score with my choic 

the husband went for their tritip dip sandwich tender tritip light grill then dip in our slow cook rosemari au jus top with swiss chees and stuf in a toast hoagi roll 895  sad it was veri disappoint for him lack flavor and the au jus definit need a littl someth to jazz it up

al sandwich and wrap come with your choic of fri onion ring cole slaw or side salad  we both chose the side salad and definit appreci that it a generous side salad not those thing you get from wendi 

overal i was realli pleas and the husband was not  i guess it a hit or miss here  they still accept the entertain coupon hereafter be open onli a coupl of day this is the newest mcdonald to open in the las vega valley in a few day there will be anoth mcdonald open a few mile west at blue diamond and durango

  i just happen to have caught this mcdonald act on the way back from hike the blue diamond road landscap seem to chang everi week new to the landscap is the old familiar golden arch sign after hike for six hour i was exhaust and need a snack

  late my opinion of mcdonald is that it doe a better job of fill the void for a light meal snack frape mocha or coffe if a coffe shop is not around to temporarili hold over my appetit and enjoy a beverag besid water that i had been drink all the day on the hike i order the 1 larg coke and 1 hot  spicy

  be a new mcdonald this locat is modern and for now immacu clean first off it is a nice first impress when a mcdonald is not part of a gas station like the one down the road at blue diamond and rainbow i enter through modern electr slide door there were two manag and i got a nice greet the worker were on top of their game there were plenti of booth to choos from the interior is more contemporari than mcdonald land the mcdonald playland is nonexist what doe exist is a chandeli and a more eleg lobbi they did not go modern to the point of some restaur that featur the super coke machin with a 100 plus flavor the typic coke flavor they had were not flat

 mcdonald may not be 4 star dine howev when i just want a snack to fill me up or a frape caramel mcdonald get the job done 

the daniel s yelp 100 challeng review 88i was a littl bit disappoint with letoil i mean i did get a decent meal and by all mean recommend it if you can afford it but for the amount of money i drop on this meal  more than ive ever spent on ani meal in my entir life  i expect noth short of perfect what i got was justgood

to start the servic was weak and unprofession our waitress did not approach our tabl until fifteen minut after we were seat and she didnt appear to be veri talent at her job that is she could be a littl too talkat at time and yet she made herself veri difficult to find when she was need she by no mean was the worst waitress ive had but this clear isnt your stereotyp snooti frenchman wait on you hand and foot experi i would figur a place like this can afford to hire the cream of the crop in servic staff

and the food was realli good but it wasnt great my main cours scallop was alright but not worth the tripl cost i paid for them when compar against mani seafood restaur same goe for my girlfriend pumpkin and squash dishes

i realli truli enjoy the not french onion soup and that has to be the most memor experi for me at this restaur it take a lot of talent to bring a soup up to that kind of silki consist and it was so absolut pack with flavor that i had to work at in veri small sip i also appreci the chef constant send out amuseboch to keep us happi between courses

if there a carpaccio plate on the menu when you choos to come here dont pass it up i dont think you could find anywher els in town that could prepar the dish with such skill and origin i order a paperthin bison carpaccio with onion crisp and a salad on top that combin to make a flavor that was just out of this world

dessert i dont even rememb it the one cocktail we bought was too overpow to tast like much other than whiskey

overal due to the restrict cost this place is onli for veri special occas but for the price im pay i expect way more than a seri of hitormiss and id be much better off spend this kind of money in a place like chicago letoil got veri few competitor in the gourmet restaur game in madison and it realli doe showt you have hard liquor right not just beer and wine 
chautara uhm not realli 
t you dont have a fulli stock bar 
chautara uhm i guess we have liquor but we dont have a bartend so there like nobodi here that can do anyth with it 
t if i walk you through it can you do it 
chautara oh yeah yeah i can do that 

and yeah yeah you can do chautara but id say save some dollah dollah bill and head down the block to himal chuli there was noth bad about our experi i just feel as though the even at himal chuli is a touch more authent the space itself is cooler and it more cost effect if your share multipl plate the menu at chautara is a touch limit but super access for someon just tri out nepales for the first time we total dug the starter though about 6 plate larg enough to share too larg if your get an entre ill head back and mayb stick to that side of the menu the larger entre didnt leav as larg of an impresshung out here outsid with a friend for hour with my dog one saturday afternoon it was the first nice day of the year and it was nice sit out and enjoy the sun we chose this locat becaus they were on a dog friend list i found online

ther are three area to sit outsid insid eateri and insid bar you have to go insid to order and then return when your name is call 

price and food were both decent 

the most fun was watch the tag team street beggar across the street2 star 3 star 2 star 3 star 2 star 3 star 2 star 3 star 2 star 3 star 

2 star 

3 stars

3 star 

i usual ignor star on here and go straight for the meat the review itself so i would urg you to do the same 

here are some thing barriqu has going

1 darn good ice coffe 
2 you dont have to sign a cc merchant copy
3 uhm wine wall anyon 
4 get a slice of pumpkin chocol chip bread realli 
5 you know that wine wall

her are some thing that need attent 

1 been three time each time tabl were dirtay that dirti with attitud 
2 floor need a scrubbin 
3 after i wash my hand in the men room i want to wash my hands

notic a theme

mi vote go for the ice coffe wine wall pumpkin chocol chip bread wine wall wine wall and the wine wall and take your good to go yobrunch was delici the bake good are especi noteworthi and my pancak crave was definit satisfied

but be warn if you are plan on grab a meal here on a weekend plan on wait in line in a bizarr soup nazi style seat system you see sinc you order at the counter youd think find a tabl would be first come first serv like most ani other restaur on the planet where you order at the counter instead find a tabl or even a seat at the bar and then order is verboten instead you will be instruct to order your food first and then look around sheepish for somewher to sit and eat it i imagin on normal day this isnt a problem but for weekend brunch it mean you might find yourself with a plate of delici brunch item and nowher to consum it 

the effect of cours is to give the dine experi a convey belt qualiti in which you feel rush to eat and go at the veri least you find yourself avert your eye from the poor soul stand around eye your plate and check their watch basic the opposit of what brunch is suppos to be like leisur 

but again the food itself was delicii blame myself my expect were high not sure whi but they were

i found no fault per se in ani of the dish we order yet i wasnt blown away i didnt have that eagerforthenextbit kinda feel that i alway hope for everyth just seem average

a usual our parti order an appet of calamari to enjoy alongsid the complimentari bread and oliv oil no complaint though i didnt dig into either too much


a far as entre we ordered

butt pasta and parmesan

woodgril paprika sausag and octopus w red potato chickpea swiss chard san marzano tomato and saffron aioli

chicken milanes of parmesan and breadcrumb chicken w salsa verd and fri egg serv on polenta

orechiett with fraboni sausag and rapini w roast garlicsteep cream and a splash of brandy

8oz cider brine pork loin chop w yukon gold sear escarol grill lemon  tuscan oliv oil 


of everyth that we order what most stand out for me as enjoy was the pork loin chop i was abl to tri a few bite and quit enjoy the dish 

so i wouldnt rule this place out right away i plan on give it anoth tri as some other dish may pleasant surpris meim not so sure whi this place get vote best of madison all the time  i think peopl have a hard time distinguish between someth that great and someth that theyv just heard about

laredo is total averag  the servic is good the food is just okay  end of stori806
breakfast special turkey wrap with countri potato  servic was a littl slow if i wasnt in a hurri to leav and make it to work on time the wait wouldnt have been so terribl  howev onc i place my order in i swear it didnt take but two or three minut for the wrap to arriv  i didnt know how to react realli  i was happi that it came out so fast yet i wonder am i realli get ovenroast turkey here or is it process  oh well

ther are lot of good lunch spot downtown these day  this is one of them  it a cute comfort littl place with insid  outsid seat  i order a gyro which come with your choic of fri cole slaw or potato salad or you can upgrad to a regular lettuc salad for 55 so 655 as i did  i found the restaur to be clean not dirti enjoy my lunch complet  the staff member were veri friend  nice

besid mediterranean food the menu includ burger hot dog larg salad chili  daili special combo  i want to return for sure     

open from 930 am to 230 pm monday through fridaywith the two restaur closest to the dodg theatr not serv alcohol you know who you arebastard  find seamus mccaffrey befor the margaret cho show was like find an ez bake oven under the tree christma morn complet joy i realli dont know downtown so when we turn the corner and saw a bunch of smoker shwill pint on the sidewalk we ran like school girl chase zac efron quick and with our tongu out we were thirsti and readi to catch a buzz befor the show insid it was sort of narrow with a long bar on one side and scad of tabl throughout we spi an open tabl on the patio and were told we could nab that and our server would be right out and she was delight and speedi we order two stella and a coupl shot didnt see ani food but perus a pretti big menu usual fare with approach price thank you though seamus cuz the group on the patio was much more entertain than ms chofirst off didnt stay here veri long may be an hour or so but seem legit cute colleg girl and full bar a plus but a littl run down appet wing were not veri good drink were on the soft side like the live band and will to give place anoth chanc in the futurmy florist is cooler than it is good i think most peopl dig this place becaus it downtown close to the art and has a funki name other than that it kind of just okay

th food is realli overpr for what you get it not like im cheapi mccheap  im happi to pay whatev  but i expect someth worthwhil in return the food is aight the servic is aight everyth is aight

it not bad just overr mayb grossli ill eat here from time to time but i wont go out of my wayso has this restaur ever seen better days

i came here friday night with my guy look to enjoy a semiromant meal befor head over to the subtl sexi that is sidebar  i look over the yelp review decid to give this place a tri becaus the main complaint were about servic which i can deal with

so we walk into a most empti restaur at 630 on a friday not the most comfort sign of a busi  it take our waitress a littl while to stop by our tableso we perus the drink menufin she stop by and we get the ginger girl and the me so thorny

i took one sip of the ginger girl and my throat was immedi burn  i like strong drink but this was pure gasolin  my guy drink wasnt ani better  definit stick with beer or wine at this place

aft 15 minut our waitress decid to stop by and take our order  appar one can onli order one cours at a time  so we order the appet which was the main attract  postino bruschetta in downtown  but it not even close to postino  the bread isnt toast you onli get two awkward piec of each the top arent fresh and they definit dont give you enough toppings

th chees plate was alright two realli small piec of chees in my opinion  they do give you a lot of bread becaus that what your realli pay for

th entre were okay  my crab cake were cold which mean they werent even close to be prepar fresh  my guy shrimp look pretti good but just tast okay

th onli save grace of this place is the lobster bisqu  of cours it was the soup of the day so i doubt mani peopl will get to enjoy it

sad place i can see whi the review are just averag or worslook like this place took a few menu item away now it pretti standard terayaki chicken bowl place  i had an egg roll with my lunch and they gave me a packet of sweet and sour sauc blah  

overal i like this place but now it just standard stuff not as excit as it onc wasi woke up an hour later in the passeng seat of my own car my window plaster with pucker of chickengreas flavor lipstick 

appar we had met up with erica o for lunch at lo los we drank sweet tea out of mason jar the menu had item name after charact from spike lee film there was a toy toy and a betti boop in crooklyn right i could swear there was a sha nay nay in there somewhere

i was told i had order fri chicken smother in mash potato and gravi yes smother as in serv as one entiti accord to misti s i tri fruitless to eat the aforement mad creation with a fork and knife to tri and give our lunch companion erica o the impress that i was not in fact a glutton fatti without digniti as my mash potatoflavor chicken was tri to suggest

i had mention befor pass out in the car that i found the waffl to be fluffi bundl of cinnamon joy and that they tast just fine without syrup which was good becaus i end up get most of my syrup on the damn fri chickimash potatoes

they had offer us dessert afterward which doesnt make ani sens to me if i had just eaten two syrupless waffl and fri chicken soak in mash potato and cover in misaim mapl syrup the last thing id expect is to be offer red velvet cake but im sure at the time the idea seem much more reasonable

th food couldnt have been that bad for though it gave me a food coma as the nativ call it i didnt suffer ani intestin woes

th stori sound so fantast and sensat i almost didnt believ sure i wouldv rememb dine in such a wonderland of soul food stereotyp i was tempt to call erica o and crossrefer misti s account with one of her own but we were in the park lot of arrowhead mall and i need a new pair of shoe or twostraight up i talk too much

i dont mean to i just do but it might have been a good thing dure my maiden voyag to lolo i met fellow yelper kerstin order a two piec chicken with a waffl i also order a side order of mac  chees i also order the red koolaid which came prompt in a jelli jar sweet i was so excit 

then we order and wait and wait and wait and of cours  i talk and talk and talked

at first they said it would be a few minut and then they said that they were go to be make more chicken for us and promis it would be worth it i put my faith in all the other great yelper who love this place that it would be in fact  worth it so we wait some more  the waitress even offer a waffl as an appet yay

mi first tast of lolo was perfect i never had a fresh waffl except for that one time at the windmil hotel  that waffl was rubberi but lolo was noth like that rubberi shoe tread it was light crisp and amaz with it sweet cinnamon good i love it  im now worri that lolo has ruin me for all the other waffl in my future

and then we wait some more and i talk some more and then final our food came well  most of it i didnt notic it until i start to dig in to my own food that kerstin meal didnt come at first she had to wait a few minut for her meal  i felt bad as i stuf my face with my crispi fri chicken wing which was good but great ummmm yeah i guess it was it was better than most but it was a littl on the dri side honest it wasnt worth the wait i couldv been home with a bucket of the colon finest 11 herb and spice in the time it took for them to get our food out 

the mix of the flavor of the chicken and the sweet of the waffl was spectactular now this is where lolo shine the chicken by itself meh the waffl by itself oooo togeth whoa i love it 

but i couldnt even begin to eat it all there was so much food i also sampl kerstin catfish which was waay yummi  so was her green bean  potato side dish it was hot and spici and realli good with some salt

overal i love the decor especi the sign autograph on the wall  crazi kewl the drink serv in mason jar even the color of the wall i dug that the server tri but dude  it took us a few time of remind them of my mac  chees befor it hit the tabl waaaaay after we each start our dinner boo and even then  it was sticki and luke warm and lack soul there i said it a soul restur food lack soul for real

il total go back but not with as much enthusiasm as i did the first time but serious  the first time is rare the best time so here hope for better in my lolo futurive tri dine here twice  the first time i visit the resto was so pack i wait ten minut and then left  the second time debat on leav but stay  had fri chicken a waffl cornbread and the candi yam  best thing were the yam  chicken was alright  waffl was too thin light in color and soggi  it didnt help to wit one of the staff sneak in the back with a bag of bisquick while i was wait for a tabl  i thought the waffl and batter were homemad  cornbread didnt even compar to redfish or zteja  honest it tast like the dri version i tri at big citi bbq and mari callend tsk tsk

if i were to return it would onli be for the candi yamssweet potato  those deserv 5 staryay this is my 200th review

ok so i want to do someth special for my 200th review so i took myself to lolo chicken and waffl for lunch today  i had realli high expect but left kind of feel a littl let down  

i got there and sit outsid the front door was some girl who i guess was the hostess  she ask me how mani and i told her it was just me i felt kind of awkward  she show me insid and ask if i want to sit at this cram littl bar face basic a freak wall  i ask to be seat somewher els as it was realli uncomfort to sit there  

so she sat me in anoth room near the kitchen area  did this place use to be a hous or someth  it had to have been  it feel like there a zillon differ littl room with tabl  

anyway so i final got sat at a real tabl  mazel tov   a girl took my drink order but the servic was slow to order i wait and wait and final a server came and took my order i went for the 2 chicken leg and a waffl  servic actual kinda suck but im will to let it go  i wont hold it against them sinc everyon seem to like it so much

so they bring out my food  i guess it was okay but not the greatest food ive sunk my teeth into i surpris was full when i finish  the chicken was good but i think the waffl is what got me  it came with a nice amount of butter which i smear all over the waffl and then drown it in syrup i like it  thier butter realli made a difference

whil i was eat i was happi to see 2 autograph of the harlem globetrott player on the wall both of which i obvious know  impressive

needless to say i guess i was expect more  servic was spotti unimpress and actual kind of suck  food was decent but not earth shatter  i will probabl return but probabl not for some timewell i final ventur to the south side to tri out lo los let me start by say it aint rosco i still prefer rosco fri chicken i think this is a better to go spot than a dine in the restaur is veri cramp if you are claustrophob dont dine in this place is smaller than matt bb i mean you gotta go outsid to chang your mind i had to take off a star for the cramp quarter 

then i had to take off anoth star becaus it was hotter than hell in there i was sweat like a sinner in church did they even have air that is not cool liter i like that they use mason jar to serv the drink but they were even sweat befor the drink got to the tabl that how hot it was 

the staff was veri friend but we had 6 differ peopl come to our tabl we didnt know who our server was one person came and took a drink order anoth person deliv it then a third person ask if we were readi to order then a fourth ask for our order we gave it then we had a 5th person who brought the food and a 6th that we paid the bill with what the hell was that about we didnt know who to tip we also had to sit for what seem like an etern on the sun to get our bill paid for as small as lo los is they have to mani peopl run around there not a veri good use of fund if you ask me they have about a dozen tabl there and i count 9 peopl work the floor that crazi 

now on to the food i order fri chicken smother potato and butter corn i had to laugh when a girl across the room want to order grill chicken and ask what are the potato smother with this is southern cook soul food it is smother in gravi duh i thought the chicken was veri good and larg piec too the smother potato were veri good just need a littl salt the butter corn was right on point 

mi friend got the catfish and chip the catfish was good i still prefer honey bear cat the fri were good too 

all in all i think lo los is aok it would rate better if the restaur was set up differ and they would use the air conditionwasnt realli what i expect eat at lolo but i should share that i am not a huge fan of fri chicken to begin with that said i can now cross eat at lolo off my thing to do at least onc list 

dottsi describ the chicken perfect it was not greasi nor soggi i did not find it especi flavor but did pick up on the bake soda 

i was expect a much denser waffl but found it to be thin and limp 

the mac and chees was super creami and had hint of cream of mushroom soup 

noth was realli memor for me except the collard green for some reason that the flavor that remain most vivid they had a delici healthi green flavor with a nice chili flake kick 

so lolo didnt knock my sock off but lolo isnt realli for me it for peopl who love fri chicken so if that you i suggest you not miss this place youll probabl realli like itjetta and i end up here after tri to navig chino bandido and fail i just want a menu with item on it  not a score card with acronym that might as well have been arbitrarili assign

lol yup that the same emo guy haha befor work at barrio he work at portland hes a cool guy not realli emo i know  his mother well she own the root httpwwwyelpcombiztherootphoenix  which is where i get my hair cut 

yea it a small world  

so back to portland atmospher is nice upscal bar restur outsid patio avail the bar is circular and you sit around it like attack indian surround the wagon in a western flick it interest noth outstand i havent dare the food yet and might not ive live here a few year and have not tempt this place more then a few time so what the point start now

 oh and if your a marri guy live off 7th ave and georgia i know your secret wink  wink my silenc will cost ya budit is alway about serviceand saturday night i think that servic was lack in so mani ways

i am go to start at the end of the night first  there were 9 of us at the tabl all of us talk and eat  slowli but sure the server remov our plate  when she remov the last platesh plop down the checkeven after we told her that it was my friend birthday  i ask my birthday friend if we were get dessert and she ask whybecaus here is the check  so my friend ask her if we can see a dessert menu  the server repli oh i am sorrysinc nobodi said anyth to me i assum that you were all finish  wowwhat a way to upsel the tab

i have to say that even with that exchangeth server had absolut no person  the food was good  the wine pair for 30 is what peak our interestbut becaus one of our friend wasnt go to particip   her pregnanc may have had someth to do with that    the tabl wasnt allow to take part in the wine dinner  boo  the eggplant look good my burger was well a burger and the dessert were amaz  and one couldnt go wrong with 13 off bottl of wine  especi nice sinc i had an awesom shiraz  

i wouldnt outrul go here again  i didnt get the wine bar feel of the place especi sinc the food wasnt the most wine appeal  i just hope our next server has more pazazzi cant realli comment on the lunch or dinner option at bill johnson becaus they dont have much if anyth for a vegetarian like me they do have some decent breakfast though

th big appl is right down the road from us so we find ourselv here for our firstoth day meal onc in awhil they make a good veggi omelet and the spanish omelet is pretti good too

th good tasti omelet hashbrown we order em crispi  toast delici salsa

th bad the water from their big filter tast terribl to us if your get water make sure to ask that they get it from the soda fountain filter they have no varieti of tea just some black lipton wish they had some green tea and some other types

pro tip you can buy a bottlejar of salsa to go for onli 250 it good stufflet call a spade a spade there realli not that much that separ pullano from ani of it competit of which there is plenti there a hungri howi down 51st street a ballpark pizza on thunderbird pizza by napoli in the opposit direct on tbird and a domino practic across the street 

they all make pizza they all make hot wing they will all make your intestin hate you

what set pullano apart from the other is the atmospher pullano is a fun place to be there are giant tvs all over the place blare whatev sport event is go on the wall are cover with team paraphernalia and the occasion offens but amus show of patriot like a pictur of an f16 with a guy on a magic carpet shop in

pullano is the perfect place to bring larg group of peopl the staff  seem to even prefer the larger group probabl becaus they tip better 

the menu has lot of special that cater to larg tabl depend on the day you can get two for one pizza deal or a larg with 30 wing 

the wing are a littl on the crispi side but you never get the wimpi littl mini wing that place like buffalo wild wing or domino tri to screw you with when you order larg batch 

the pizza chock full of greas but it fill and tast pretti damn good i recommend the chicken alfredo pizza if you ever get a chanc on wednesday it two for one last i checked

im sure there other stuff on the menu but i wouldnt bother it a pizza place 

there a reason whi nobodi buy taco at burger kingthis place is straight up hood

i turn down the street and a dog was just run around my heart broke for that dog for the rest of the night  i want to take him home clean him up and give him to someon for christma 

i see this graffiti cover build onli not realli a build becaus there wasnt a door just a tini window not just ani window but a bullet proof one with prison bar on the outsid ummmm

th back doubl as a junk yard vacuum check gnome check stray dog random couch check check

mi friend shout this is it here it is im so excit 

uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 

there were a lot of peopl hang by this window they were perhap homeless convict i dont know

but this place work like this walk up to the window place your order and wait 

mi friend was like im not bring my whole purs up there i dont want to get pick pocket so i said ok ill bring mine it doubl as a weapon and we made our way up to the window

th food was dirt cheap we got two eggrol chicken fri rice spici chicken dinner and 12 wonton and diet coke we spent a total of 16

the food was aok and while we wait even more peopl came to the window this place was hoppin  the fri rice was the best it was super butteri and i loooovvvee butter the chicken was plain old bread and fri w a glossi spciy not realli at all sauc the fri wonton were just decent and the eggrol were delish but this is not a place i would come back to for fear of be rob 

call me angel princess but i couldnt get over the ambianc to chow down and not think twice about what type of qualiti meat i was eat at such cheap prices

tri it if your brave becaus it was definit tasti for the pricei thinkthe ultim panacea for a hangover

burrito from el norteno

 sunday i awok with a headach that could reduc a lesser man to renounc alcohol rather than do someth so drastic and foolish i opt to meander wearili down 7th ave to el norteno ride my bike there in the alreadi intoler morn sunshin i fantas about what i would order savouri green chile pork creami pollo fundido succul machaca beef mountain of delici bean gooey melt chees gallon of horchata my goal was to be the fat and happi mexican version of augustus gloop drown myself in bean rice and horchata while small guatemalan oompa loompa admonish me in song thick in the midst of daydream i near rode my bike into oncom traffic on 7th ave a wander homeless man gave me a look that suggest what the hell is this guy problem i shrug my shoulder and wait at the cross walk stare expect at my destin mouth agap drool rave and mumbl unawar of my surround tortilla and taco and tostada danc around my head like littl hallucinatori mariachi the homeless guy i saw earlier manag to catch up to me at the cross walk and again he stare dumbfound with the same look i paid him no heed i was so close to my goal if onli the light would turn
 final the punish light turn and i rode across onc there i realiz there was no where i could safe lock my bike up and in this area id either lock it up or end up walk home i walk it a littl up the street and found sound rod iron gate i could hook the ulock around i start walk back and i see the same homeless dude go insid ahead of me i curs my luck and follow him into the cramp littl closet of an area insid where you place your order the homeless guylet call him thurston was third in line behind two port hispan guy assum father and son i sat and sat cramp behind the three ahead of me thurston final got his chanc to place an order and opt for two mexican pizza again i curs my luck know how long it would take to actual get my food
 after thurston place his order he step outsid into the glare sunshin i got up rub my hand togeth rapid and step up to the counter i chose the pollo fundido plate and a carn asada chees crisp with horchata and after wait eager my number was final call i grab my order head to the littl eat area and promplti black out appar over dose on mexican foodas if trap in a bad cowboy movi i belli up to the bar at the origin hamburg work and couldnt help but think what have i gotten myself into

countri music was play on the jukebox and it was a littl unnerv to overhear a convers between other patron about a bar fight

then the buxom bartend said hi and someth in her voic was genuin and welcom and her smile could have brighten a room pour a pitcher of beer from the tap then set an icecold glass in front of me she offer up a menu

whil the 30yearold eateri in phoenix is show it age the attitud is laid back and super friendly

th origin hamburg work has two dine room the bar and a more familyfriend space the tast is decid kitschi with wall cover in vintag sign sport memorabilia and chotchki galor the atmospher is fun larg tabl can accommod big group order are place and paid for at the counter in the bar order are taken by the bartender

lik a campfir there is someth mouthwat about the strong smell of mesquit wood smoke eman from the kitchen you can tell from watch the cook manhandl slab of meat over an open flame that the burger here are treat right

th centerpiec of the dine room is a wagon fill with freshslic tomato lettuc onion and pickl and condiment and salad dress you are in control of your burger destini with as mani ladl of ranch dress as youd like id recommend not go too heavi on the condiment and top the burger here can stand on their own

bit into the big one 409 give new mean to the whimsic say a deep amber charbroil crust surround the 13 pound of fresh ground beef insid it perfect medium as order the meat is toothsom well season and burst with a wonder beefi caramel flavor

potato aka fri 179 were disappoint pale and seem unsalt id opt for the onion ring 269 fri golden brown and addict with dunk into ranch dressing

if you dont eat red meat your in luck they make a juici chicken sandwich 509 cook over the same mesquit coal this sandwich has a surpris amount of satisfi heft the italian version get a treatment of flavor ad italian dress befor get cook to a savori finish

fair warn when eat buffalo wing nine piec for 595 dont wear a nice shirt these are so sloppi that you may need a stack of wetnap to get through the plate but exact how they should be

th origin hamburg work might be a littl bit countri but the burger are a whole lot of rock n rolli never heard of this outfit until i move over here from la at the begin of 09  i see on their websit that they have store all the way across the south  southwest but not in california  now it has taken me all this yearandahalf plus to tri the place a stone throw from my hous but today i final made it

i found a clean comfort dine room here an easi to follow menu friend servic  low price  that certain a start  so i order a burger fri  a vanilla shake  creativ huh    

mi whataburg was a good huski burger with better tast than a whopper or jumbo jack i think  the fri were hot  crispi  the shake good  not as special as the one at jack in the box or carl jr but also much less expensive

whataburg combo wshake upgrad  583

everyth was right about this place  i like itlos compadr is an aok place to stop and have some aok mexican food you order via a friend counter servic and they give you a number i order the chicken enchilada with rice and bean they were good noth fanci or spectacular just straightforward i wish for a littl more flavor in the chicken but it wasnt horribl i also ate ayesha leftov the next day solid 

if your look for a spot that a bit hole in the wall simpl mexican then los compadr is the spot for you i would glad return and tri their other entrei understand whi peopl would want to like mari coyl they serv ice cream in everi way imagin the nostalgia they hand makepack the ice cream they have a drive through 

now here is whi you would not want to like mari coyl it is overpr your cholesterol will rais by at least fifteen point befor you leav dimwit 16yearold work there the bathroom are gross i have had better soft serv cone at mcdonald 

here is the deal everyon should tri out mc onc just to say they have been there but bewar make sure you wear your fat pant and make sure you know where the nearest hospit is just in case someon in your parti get a clog arterii cant bring myself to give thai rama more than 3 star i love thai food and i want to love thai rama but i just didnt  i thought the restaur itself was cute casual and unassum the staff was friend but not the most attent  i was there on a sunday night recent and i felt extrem comfort dine solo big plus for that

unfortun when i was given my menu there was a dri up noodl stuck to it and the napkin on the tabl are pretti but polyest and not the best for wipe the noodl off or absorb anyth at all for that matter  i was also disappoint that i didnt see a thai salad with peanut dress or summer roll on the menu  

i decid to order the 6 to start  lab gai fine chop chicken light saute in lemon juic with red onion and mint  mayb i shouldv order it without onion becaus onion was everywher  the flavor of the chicken was good but it was difficult to eat with so much onion  i went with the vegetarian dish 69 yes i said 69 as my entre  paht paug jae or veget delux  i request that they add eggplant and they did  it was pretti tasti and i clean my plate with that one

overal the meal was ok  mayb im spoil by some other thai favorit in the valley but im glad i experienc thai rama  i probabl will not rush back but if your look for a decent thai meal and your in the cen pho area you can find it at thai ramaive had better  from here too p thai rama is go to hell in a hand basket 

so depress all my old haunt are close or serv up hot crap on a platter 

i am not a thai connoisseur by ani mean trust but i do enjoy a good pad thai everi now and again i went here a coupl week ago with my sis 
she got her hot and sour soup and for me pad thai my mouth was water just think about it 

then it happen me so stupid bring me someth that i did not order  didnt even come close to pad thai wtf wrong tabl but mayb i should have kept it becaus what came next was unaccept 
it look tasti smell tasti but my tasti bud had to spit it out 
1st it was so hot i thought the cook i do mean cook and not chef from ls dos molino was moonlight at thai rama holi pepper batman this shit was hot but serv at room temperatur go figur the noodl were wayyyyyi over cook they were past and i am an al dent kinda girl al dent you know firm but tender anyway

off with you head they took it away and tri again to my dismay i receiv a now flavorless dish with similar noodl i think they made them in advanc and are fish them out as peopl order bluck plth wipe my tongu off 

anyway this is not as i rememb and i dont think i will go back unless someon els is buy tee hee i onli gave it a 3 star becaus my sis said her soup was delish as alway again mayb the cook from los is follow meit good really
it authent realli 
it hard to find really

but the veggi beef stew is terribl really

sometim the ppl take ur order arent the nicest i use to be a part of a indian educ program and we use to get food from there all the time like 56 time a month so i know my frybread hous onc the stew tast like someon drop a cigarett in it 

they have great hot sauc and great indian taco im oodham and yes we are decend of the ancient huhukam those who are gone tribe the owner is tohono oodham and it show in his bread and style of he serv his bean it yummi 

when i go i looov to get the red chili and bean combo and load it up with salt and mayb even get a plain bread and load that up with hot sauc d 

if your on that side of town keep your eye open and drive down 7th street sloooow so you dont miss it and get an extra bread to eat with the salsa  and stay away from the veggi beef stewi want to put sonic on the fast food plateau that i find in n out to be certain burger puke and mcvomit know where they are on the chain of chain and i love the car hop style allow you to perus the menu and hit the red button when your readi while enjoy some depech mode or pet shop boy the chili dog is sad no snap just a sad soggi ass dog in a sad soggi ass bun the burger are ok one up from the king and ronald but well below in n out tater tot that what i like here mmmm but the onion ring no it like they ad vanilla to the batter and they end up tast like febrez ring gross but the beverag are top notch strawberri limead alway hit the spot i dont crave em like i do my in n out burger but when i wanna feel like ralph malph or potsi at the car hop with richi and the fonz i pull my wheel in to sonicwrite this review is so tiresome

too mani noodl and theyr overcook  the result cloudi thicken broth for leftov the next dayi am not sure i have ever had mole befor or if mayb i have had it and not like it so stay away  whatev i did like the mole on my chicken enchilada  the enchilada themselv were soso  quit often in mexican restaur i have to mix the rice and bean togeth to get them down for sever reason  this time the rice and bean each stood on their own merit  the chip were good and serv warm  i prefer the red salsa even though it was hotter as it had more flavor to me  it is sort of runni and is a bit hard to chase around the littl plate that come for that purpos  the enchilada came with all white meat my favorit but i could have done without the chunk of cartilag and two bone piec i found

mani of the custom there dure lunch on a friday seem like regular  i dont think i heard a singl word of spanish from either custom or employe the whole time i was in there  the dine room with it flagston floor has a nice comfi feel to it  there were two waitress that seem like they were work as a team and i didnt wait long or want for anyth  the park lot hold small car easier than truck but there were sever work truck in there

a good solid place to eat if you are in the area but not a destin place from far awaywe have been go to brad for over 15 year it realli has not chang much 

the interior is blah
th staff is strang yet nice
th food is ok to good 

everyth is bread and fri but the bread is good the cod fillet was meati and good 

 it was just too much greas after the ring and fish 

it was 27 for 4 of usnot too badif i say it wasnt as bad as i was expect is that good  25 stars

i have onli eaten at a jbs onc  that was in price ut probabl 3 or 4 year ago  it was memor bad  so when i offer to pick up lunch for an employe and they pick this place i was expect the worst  i went in with diminish expectations

i play it safe with a blt fri and a shake  it was ok  yay  the blt was actual almostwellpretti good  hey that wasnt as bad as i thought it would beopen in 1970 la piñata a famili affair has been dish up sonora style mexican food for 39 year walk into the restaur your immedi transport back to 1970 no time machin requir thank to dark orang vinyl booth plastic wood lamin tabl and stucco wall the onli element miss were the tradit mexican dress though it someth feel like it wasnt that long ago when those may have been retir even in the 70s style la piñata is relax like go to a friend hous for dinner the dark orang vinyl might be origin but you can tell this place is love and well care for  not a strip of duct tape anywhere

start with chip and salsa is almost alway pure happi hot and crispi slight salti pair with thick chunki salsa a real bargain at free be warn if you think thick and chunki mean mild and bland far from it on first bite the fresh tomato flavor burst into your mouth follow quick by a smack of the spici chili heat the 2 contrast work so well togeth that it quit difficult to stop eat until the bowl is empti clever hidden in the back as to make it more special is anoth salsa this one be almost as spici and slight sweet mani mexican restaur have a spicier salsa they keep in back and will onli bring out if request ask for this one and your server will happili bring you out a dish

for lunch la piñata offer a varieti of special there a taco in my burro 495 that use a larg flour tortilla fill it up with ground beef lettuc tomato chees and onion  tri get your mouth around this one letter f 895 combin a taco of your choic and a chees enchilada serv with rice and bean the shred beef taco was decent but it was the chees enchilada that rock this plate the sauc was so wonder creami you couldnt tell where the sauc end and the melt chees began   a dozen of these wouldnt be enough  a taco salad 650 could be consid a lighter option if the delici crunchi shell was miss who want to give up that textur for a few hundr calori choic of chicken or beef and top by larg dollop of guacamol and sour cream pure calor heaven   

asid from the luncheon menu the remaind can be order all day be a great place to start the mari lou 875 may sound like a retir olymp gymnast is actual red or green chile with meat fold into a humong chees crisp serv with a cruet full of sour cream the red chile has a certain creami that further contrast with thick tender cube of beef and a spoon of sour cream so easi to swallow piñata appet 1250 come on a larg dinner plate liter fill with miniatur taco chimichanga flauta green corn tamal and a bowl of refri bean for dip this is the mother lode of appet easili feed 24 diner or for a larger appetit order as a main cours be abl to tri so mani differ item at one time make this the dim sum of mexican food

a you can tell the portion size at la piñata are extrem generous the tio pancho pollo con queso 1195 is an entre forc to be reckon with a deep fri burro stuf with tender season chicken and smother in melt jalapeno cream chees and cheddar chees easili mesmer by it girth one bite and youll know whi you order it simpli fantast the yucatan 1195 is similar in it approach though this time your given the choic of meat chicken or beef onc again smother this time in their spinach con queso sauc that combin chees and spinach into each cheesi melti bite napkin required

ther are also 10 combin plate for the diner who enjoy varieti the number 2 1095 come with 2 red or green chees enchilada with rice and bean again the enchilada here are simpli top drawer refri bean are general the norm but there is noth normal about how good these tast these refri bean could easili make up a meal on their own with a bowl of chip and salsa or you can wrap your fist around a bean burrito 425 and savor each creami smooth mouthful

with so much savori and spici it nice to know that there are dessert to refresh your palat the hous made flan 425 is a great way to finish your meal it isnt possibl but the caramel sauc serv with the flan would make an excel dessert soup light syrupi with a rich butteri tast if they do start serv bowl of it you read it first here sopapilla with honey 295 is alway a sticki and sweet pleaser light fri and delic crisp on the outsid steami chewi on the insid all slather with thick rope of golden honey it isnt just dessert but a simpl pleasure

w are bless to have one anoth in our busi day to day live so it nice to know that there are such welcom place like la piñata where we can tear tortilla eat homemad bean and just enjoy and celebri came here after spend some qualiti time at the dealership across the street  this place is kinda home   i ate breakfast and had a skillet  mm  it was tasti  

this place is noth fanci  price are reason  i enjoy my time herefor the record im the world worst vegetarian well pescetarian but yelp doesnt think that a real word whatev im bad at all of it i have a weak for wing 

what even wors is that i didnt even know i had this weak until jetta r and amanda b decid to pray upon it by take me to angi and jimmi the wing were alreadi on the tabl when i walk in the door i never stood a chanc just like the bacon on christma morn dont judg me 

the interior pizza and ambianc are question at best those other review are so not lie about the plastic furnitur which is weird sinc the serv plate are those trendi squar one in earth tone extra point for not have enough park space  thus result in us park in the lot for the porn store next door if i was half the pig im will to admit id take sick joy in that juxtaposit 

but you didnt come to aj for the pizza you didnt come here to impress a date you came here for wing becaus you trust me to send you to good wing and angi and jimmi know wing they know them like jetta r know wrestl and b movi they know them so well they taught me to love wing and to question my entir veglean lifestyl 

damn you angi and jimmi i have to rethink my entir outlook on food becaus of you mayb i should mull over what im do with my life over anoth order of medium with squeez bottl ranchi use to love cook and when i cook im actual semidec  i taught myself through trial and error and a bunch of cook show a few year back  and then i went to med school  now i rare cook and we tend to eat out a lot

im not realli sure whi we keep go back here  the staff is sometim friend the food is sometim good and i could do without the wild west theme

actu the food especi the dinner are cafeteria qualiti can green bean instant mash potato tough meat i think they should actual serv it in one of those squar plate with the divid to make it more authentic

th breakfast are more appet and realli realli cheap

that it bill johnson is cheap and easi  we keep go back becaus it fill the belli without empti the wallet  it easi to get to from my hous and easi to rememb becaus of it kitchyan old favorit that can still deliv ok valu though it hasnt kept up with the time nor has it retain all of it oldschool flavor

i rememb come here as a small child and be stun by the assort western crapstuff nail to the wall and suspend from the ceil the sawdust on the floor and the shape waitress with big iron on their hip and cowgirl shirt that were cut to fit the food was never bad but the food was never realli the point

now a lot of the former flair seem to have diminish they dont do radio broadcast from here anymor the sawdust has been replac with spars wood shave a lot of the memorabilia seem to have been raid and the waitress have a shape but it main round these day so now you have a sort of lacklust menu of various burger steak chop and rib none of which realli stand out and servic tend to be kinda slow

i would take outoftown here to give them a hokey arizona experi with no promis about the qualiti of the foodif you are on the westsid and in the need for some decent american chines this is a great spot 

first off this place is dirt cheap and the serv are ginorm the menu is actual quit larg for the kind of place that it is with all the usual suspect some of them even surpris tasti they have a daili special that is around 3 buck and is basic a bowl of rice top with whatev the select may be all entre item can either be order in a combin form with rice crab puff egg roll for around 5 or a la cart for around 650 the a la cart is a larg clam shell full of your choic  my person favorit are the orang chicken the hous chicken and the pork fri rice serious i could probabl devour an entir clam shell of their orang chicken it the perfect amount of crunch and spice and at 350 i can nosh on a quart of hot and sour soup basic until i can stand no more 

the ownersstaff are incred nice ex they liter will call you by name upon your second visit the decor is realli plain but it alway clean and tabl are attend to quick 

they offer take out and deliveri if you are in the general area but this is one of my goto place if i want someth fast i simpli call in my order hop in my car and in the 5 to 7 minut it take me to get there they have my order prep and readi to go their hour are rough 1100 am to 830 pm  monday through saturday but if you are on the cusp i would recommend call ahead as on occas famili issu forc them to adjust 

if you are in the neighborhood of 35th ave and thoma give them a tri and see if you dont agre that they are aok and recess friend  good pizza so so wing good pastaok so im sit here now at this starbuck do a job search  ive been here sever time befor on and off over the past few month  this starbuck isnt so bad but here what ive notic sinc come here

th staff is alway friend and help  i like that about this place and they realli know their stuff  the place is a long narrow suit so seat is kind of tight but ampl  not a lot of room to spread out but decent enough that you can at least move around a bit

on of the downsid is that if your here to use the wifi it free hooray the downsid  good luck get a plug there onli two plug avail for devic at either end of the store  if your stuck in the middl i hope your batteri has a long life plus a few time that i have been here there have been plug hog who use all the outlet yes there onli two but whos the butthead who need to charg their phone and comput at a starbuck  if your go to be here a while i hope your batteri life is good

they do have outsid seat with umbrella but their not alway open  park is ampl and it not half bad  great hour etc  swing by if you have a chanc and you can get your coffe and wifi on like me  definit not the greatest starbuck in town but not the worst eitherright off the bat they got 2 thing go for them  they open at 6 so you dont wast half the morn get breakfast and they serv grit with butter

i had the chef omelet grit and an english muffin i happen to like my stuff cook into the egg and i still call it an omelet  the food was good  the servic was good too  if you are a first time visitor you get introduc to all the server  most of the folk there seem to be regular  

while noth was over the top great it is a good solid place to get breakfast or lunchme and my tummi have a veri close relationship the 2 of us are alway in adventur mode especi around my work zone my friend brian also has a veri close relationship with his tummi as well though isnt adventur at all  so when he suggest a place i know that it go to be simpl down home and risk free 

so after a brief convers the 4 of us were off to los compadr we were sat immedi which lucki for us we plan earli sinc this place fill up realli fast warm chip and 2 kind of salsa are put in front of you almost as quick as you are sat the thinner spici salsa was the better of the 2 my tummi agre while brian like the thinner version his tummi was like oh hell no 

now get down to busi we order lunch special and get this they are 495  695 11a3p daili talk about dine on a dime rachael eat your heart out babi order a c taco enchilada green burrito with rice and bean no what brian order has me stump you see we were both distract by one of the other guest a veri lean and handsom latino so i didnt even pay attent to what brian order i think it was an enchilada and taco or someth 

the food and servic here are veri fast and friend though brian said to avoid the bald guy station that hes not veri nice to his guest lunch was out in under 10 minut so we had plenti of time to ogl over the eye candi onli 2 tabl away 

when the food arriv it was pipe hot the portion size were generous and the smell was great i dug right in the green chile burro was pretti darn good it almost had a creami qualiti to the sauc so i spill some of the chile onto my tostada and in a coupl of crunch had manag to woof the whole thing down the taco was eh crunchi but not veri flavorful

mi tummi was pur as we left i could tell our tummi were say good thing about us as well as our eye what a feasti am not a fan of sonic nor much fast food in general but after drag the man around town to see where i use to work  move back to ca just under 5 year ago where i use to live as a teen where i went to hs where i own a hous where my grandpar use to live etc he felt like he deserv a treat and i agre had we had more time and he endur the earli childhood tour 310 he could have had mari coyl 

sonic has these crazi drink slushi concoct and ice cream and just plain stoner food chili chees and frito wrap in a tortilla sinc we were not hungri he want an ice cream cone and a cherri lime slushi thing so we pull up push a button and order i had a larg diet dr pepper he had drink and conetot 300 whi so cheap we wonderthen we seeson has a happi hour on their drink from 24pm gtfo serious cool

whi onli 3 star thenwel that was for the 300 hey it is fast food folk and to be honest onc i drank my drink and got down to the ice i rememb that phoenix water tast nasti and that make for nasti iceeven if it is crushwe drive by this place on our way to work everi morn  everi time i look at it i just laugh  the name crack me up  we final decid to stop by after work last friday for a quick bite

th girl at the counter was veri nice and effici  the menu  for steakenburg consist of either cheesesteak or burger with a few chicken item thrown in for good measur  i felt like get the whole experi and order the steakenburg  this is a interest concoct of a doubl cheeseburg with a littl bit of philli cheesesteak busi pile on top of that  it sound ridicul i know  it came with fri and a drink too  the fri were greasi but perfect for dip in ranch  the burger was also greasi but i think it need some chang  first get rid of the extra hamburg patti and put more cheesesteak on it  also instead of provolon chees drown that babi in chees whiz  that the way it suppos to be right

anyway it a weird place  i may stop by again but who know  ive had better burger but these are aokheard about this place on one of my favorit morn talk radio show and decid to give them a shout out been here a few time in the past when in the area and hungri for some grub

thi is your basic burger wing cheesesteak pizza and deep fri vittl joint they even offer a few item that go coco crazi spici one is call the diego dave habanero wingz challeng if you can finish 10 wingz in under 10 minut you will get a free t shirt and your photo on the wall

w have tri the zombi wingz the hellzapoppin doubl chees burger a coupl of the steaken philli sandwich and a few of the differ deep fri appet we both thought the food was pretti good but not outstand kinda like a dairi q on steroid and then some

servic is friend and help give them visit and go spici if you dare i could just buy their spici habanero hot sauc and put it on some ice cream might even rub a littl on my sore knee oh yeah

35 starwas here on a slow night they just began host free poker and just like karaok night the purpos is to bring in peopl when they arent alreadi coming

th slow busi work well for play poker as the singl bartenderserv was abl to handl everyon nice and with friendli  

the place itself is super cool  two stori tall done all up in wood wall with old fashion gas pump and junk  it use to be call the servic station at one time but i heard that no one could find it nestl in a strip mall full of noth but actual auto mechan shop tire store and car stereo instal places

i can see shenanigan hop on the right night and with atmospher this cool dont know whi ani of the local youngster alcohol crowd would want to congreg at nearbi nativ new yorker applebe hooter or santisi brossorri shenanigans
your a classic exampl of unrealis potential
a ladi on a pole can realli screw up a brutha judgement

such supercool dig and yet appar satisfact with such a generic standard  the sportsbar go on in this establish are not worthi of the amaz architecture

thi new disillusion is base on my recent attempt to actual use the bar for it main purpos to drink alcohol  

after a sad quick glanc at the beer tap pull the pyramid of empti on the back of the bar make it seem like there a larg select of bottl at least

but no my hoppi friend that is not the case  i think the most imagin thing there was sam adam boston lager  they had blue moon but im not a fan  think of everi singl other generic american beer and it lite version and it there  whi  whi have 6 or 7 differ brand of american ferment rice lager when the current trend in pub style have everyon and their mother drink microbrew ale stout and hefe 

also  i understand cost and spillag etc and how import that kind of thing can be to the owner bottom line esp employe theft but i have never in my life seen a bar instal special cap on all the bottl of liquor and an electron devic that fit over the bottl and measur an exact pour  
i get it  
but it stupid
and if as the bartend your go to make a comment that it not your fault the owner make you use such a thing at least learn how to use the damn thing  if im onli get that one ounc then youd better be sure squirt the liquor down onto your overfil of ice cube doesnt splash my captain all over the side instead of into the glass  and then youd better not splash the soda in so full to the top that it spill over the side  that my ounc i paid for it and appar im not get anymore

if you like generic beer and dont get mix drink then this place can still be pretti cool
if i win a lotto im buy the damn build and tie the owner to a wall for a month so she can see how a bar with this much potenti should be runif your look for the same americhino fare that you had here in 1983 well there it is  same menu same recip same grease
ther noth too terribl about their greasi fri 
rice egg roll chicken chicken wing sesam chicken onion ring egg foo young ss pork and jello
y even the jello was deep fri and greasi  not really
ther just not much select and what you get is mbleh
that half meh and half blah
everyon keep say well at least it onli 6  
well for that price i could pick from a half dozen gem within a mile radius of this nostalg black hole boofay of yesteryear
but ill generous round them up   theyr friend the food tasti and fill and fuggit it was onli 625 for the pizza 35 for the wing 5 for the way it use to be 

let me take you back to 1988 on the corner of 19th ave and union hill rd there was a safeway walgreen and sardella they were the new kid to the hood my wonder momz and i were next door get some useless crap from walgreen and the hunger hit momz alway like a good pizza

pric the price are reason the price are fair for the quality
 they are competit servic the guy at the counter was nice and polit food wing  i am veri picki about my wing first bite from one tell me everyth i need to know and if ill have more sardella wing are big juci and not slather in sauc like some place they were just right so if your crave wing this is a good place becaus they are better than alot of place out there for wing pizza satisfi and fulfil everyonescrav the crust is just right not too thick and not too thin and cook just right the tomato sauc had a nice balanc of flavor to itand is perfect season meatbal a littl bland the marinara sauc was ok ive had way better conclus everybodi seem satisfi with their food and i was too  not the best pizza  wing but good they have good varieti on the menu in addit to pizza they have pasta salad calzon and wingservic was 2 star the guy did not want to be there 

food was 35 star i had a pollo capres which is a grill chicken breast in a lemon butter type sauc serv with thin noodl and cherri tomato sauc it also had 4 small bite of chees which i suppos was homemad mozzarella 

while it was all good it was just bore noth stood out and said hey you realli like this 

just averag food now i rememb whi it has been year sinc we have been therethis place is good servic is good pizza is good the price is ok the build is get a littl worn down 

there is onli an outsid tabl to eat there noth insidi basic order an egg biscuit sandwich and a diet dr pepper when i dont have time to prepar breakfast at home the food tast great but unless your in the drive thru you can expect a longer wait i dont go thru the drive thru becaus i just spent 73 on gas this morn and i dont need to burn ani extra gas while wait in line plus sometim the diet dr pepper tast a littl funki unless you let the soda that been sit in the tube overnight run for awhil befor put your cup under the dispens and as of today i guess they dont give napkin with your to go order when you order inside

i suggest this mcdonald get a littl bit more woman power dure the morn rush to servic the custom in a more time mannerand the challeng danc stuf in my pocket recieves

3 and 14 stars

pink lotus is a decent clean holeinthestripmal americhino classic

their extens menus includ all the basic prepar hot and fresh for you to takeout or dine in as long as the odd mural on the wall doesnt scare you off  pic

th food was pretti good  general tsao chicken is a baromet to me and pink lotus rendit was a littl differ  think more along the line of spici terriyaki than hoysin  but there were lot of bit of green onion and minc fresh garlic im still get garlic burp  the consist as well as the flavor that was underneath the sauc was more like rough chop chunk of crispi fri chicken than the usual batterbal  good but a littl greasy

pink lotus is pretti generous with give small discount to deserv communiti member like militari or helathcar worker pic

theyv been hidden on the outsid edg of this shop center for year and id never notic them before

food the menu is standard chines take out servic could hard understand the person who answer the phone food was deliv hot and quick conclus  the food was decent and the price was right return  factor 100

 what doe my overal rate mean 

5 star high recommend  i would be will to drive out of my way to this busi it is that good this place repres their industri or cuisin veri well 
4 star  high recommend i would frequent this busi 
3 star  not that good but not that bad just averag i wouldnt mind go again 
2 star  i would not recommend this establish to friend or famili 
1 star  do yourself a favor and do not patron this busi i would run away from this place and you should too dont wast your hard earn money at this establishi went here for lunch today becaus it is close to work was not crowd and cheap i was surpris to see that after the smoke ban was start this place is now clean smell good and invit 

the bartend waitress server and friend to all the patron seem to know everi one name and what they want as they walk in they have all the normal bar drink and appear to have a great follow 

i had a 13 lb burger it is a premad thing but tast good it is a littl thin for my tast it come with frys claw potato salad etc i had the frys which are crinkl cut and good the meal was 6 buck and some chang 

i will be back but think i will tri the wing and a captain n cokei had hope for more 

i order orang chicken with rice egg roll and wonton 

the wonton were fri too much the egg roll was good the rice was old and dri and the orang chicken was ok 

they use white meat chunk light batter and fri with a nice flavor orang sauc 

i will tri them again and hope it is betteri like the comparison to ladi  the tramp that nathan s made in his review this place total remind me of that scene too with the red  white checker tabl cloths

th servic at anzio is usual veri good
th salad are veri good
th bread is good
th pizza and the other dish are just ok
th beer select is lack no good microbrew get some sierra nevada new belgium beer or at least some four peak would ya

and that all ive got to say about thatsometim you can judg a book by it cover this look like a typic diner and inde that what it was even though the place was busi sunday breakfast time i was immedi seat the server were friend and everyon use the obligatori hon when address you and the food came fast in spite of the busi time tast and qualiti of the food were typic for a diner  ok not great but the pancak were definit more than i could finish not as inexpens as i though it would be pancak 3 with bacon and egg and a cup of coffe came to a few cent short of 10 buck veri casual atmospher most of the folk here were attir like they were about to do some home garden after breakfastanoth ghettocent area place that on my recent freechiptourneypokerbing rout bullshoot is a huge pool hall bar   former known as sixshoot i guess that name wasnt set a veri good exampl of the kind of behavior theyd like you to exhibit while patron their fine establishment

they must be get a slight better calib of patron now sinc onli a singl bouncer was present at the front door area and this guy would have to fart to have even a hint of an air of badass anywher near him

th place is quit larg with plenti of space for uncrowd game at a coupl dozen or more pool tabl plus dart game foosbal a few video game vend machin etcetc  

there is a kind of a side room with tabl for eat etc but that where they put the poker tabl  the smoker patio is just off this room and the open between has no door or enclosur at all  this let way too much smoke into the build and i cant see how it fit with the current state law  im call bullshooot

th server here are abund i got servic i got serv  it all sound wrong  right away and never wait for refills
they keep em in tight tank and jean and that work of cours but anyon i interact with was genuin friend  way better than the supoos spectacular yet overhyp santisi girl httpwwwyelpcombizsantisibrotherspizzeriasportsgrillphoenixhridkrs5sog4kwm92e1qvgtu2w 

didnt eat but they have a full for a bar menu of the usual stuff

bullshoot give bar buck as prize for the poker tourney 
i won a 10 gift certif to spend there next time yea me for get second place out of like 5 tabl  shitchyeawhile on the hunt for someth for the famili to quick eat at a nearbi basketbal tournament  we decid to give ole bill a tri  
love the  kitschi vibe of this placeton of  funni to obnoxi sticker and sign plaster the place   for a minut i thought it was two hippi sub shopp  but this littl hole in the wall doe a soild busi sling out the standard american sub  while noth to flavor was order by my troup i am will to go back and find the hidden gem that must be in  this dive   

word to the wise bring cash or be prepar to pay a dollar fee for a debit credit card realliwhen you dine here expect to receiv a lot of food  you definit wont go hungri they serv standard american chines fare and i find the qualiti of the food to be a tad abov most chines restaur of this kind servic is friend and price are good i wouldnt go out of my way to come here but if your in the area maryval this is a good choic if your hungri and want a lot of decent qualiti chines foodroll that is my primari reason for go to a place like this more than onc texa roadhous has the best dinner roll when they are serv hot throw in the cinnamon butter and it a littl oral fiesta i am not someon who like go to outback steakhousetyp chain i onli set foot in texa roadhous becaus i won a gift certif but consid the price the qualiti is more than decent their rib are truli falloffthebon i had their countri fri chicken which wasnt veri greasypoint for that they also serv realli tasti catfish fillet that arent dri and are flavor i also like how one of their mani side offer includ sweet potato and they are big potato you can easili come away with leftov which mean two meal for the price of one 

if you are not in the mood to be in a place where the wait staff highlight birthday veri loud then skip roadhous when it someon bday they actual have the person sit on a saddl and get everyon to sort of yeehaw along it like a bad commerci anyway i can see myself go into one if im in the neighborhood and want to splurg on food that isnt the healthiest35 stars

texa roadhous is known for their rib and dog gone they are delici  the meat just fall off the bone and is so tender  my famili realli enjoy the warm roll with cinnamon butter along with the peanut  while you wait for your meal  this place is pretti cool to bring a friend or famili member for their birthday  they will drag out a hors saddl on a sawhors for the birthday girl or boy to sit on while you have happi birthday sung to you and finish with a hefti yeehaw  all the while your abl to snap pic of the person you are tortur  

the steak are tasti just like the rib  the pull bbq pork is one of the few item that are inconsist from my experi  havent has a salad here how can one eat a salad here when the aroma of barbecu is tempt you as you walk in  

call ahead seat is the best way to avoid long wait dure peak time  next to the hostess podium you will see a cooler show off the differ cut of avail steak  i will be sure to snap a photo of the cooler on my next tripwhi onli 3 star

area is questionmani year ago i work at a swensen in california  i was thrill to have such a fun job scoop ice cream the memori of those day has made me crave my favorit ice cream flavor  chocol peanut butter a flavor that use to be my rich sweet special ice cream treat friend well yesterday i surpris the kid with a trip to swensen i actual thought it was close for some reason  
the place remind me a lot of the place i work at same oaki dark brown wood marbl tabl  mani of the same flavor of ice cream they stil have load of rich top and combin of flavor   
the bummer is the flavor did not have the butterfat flavor of swensen of old it was tasti  it was good but not earth shake and i like my treat earth shake good 
it is a quaint place  good for take grandma out for an old fashion sunda kid out for ice cream after eighth grade graduat  or stop for a treat with your kidbruce and i went to look at one of our list in that part of town last week god what a horribl littl home well we decid we should reward ourselv for put our sens in such shock that we decid to go to mimi 

bruce be such a picki eater he doe not have mani place he will go and by picki i mean odd 

anyroad i have not been in sever year and it was just as i rememb a nice fill sandwich and cup of soup it was all good and the servic was just spiffi too in fact when i ask where the rest room is i was taken by hand and led there a littl strang actual but great servici live in the neighborhood and have gone here for birthday cake donut for the offic breakfast sandwich and the black and white cooki everyth has been pretti decent and the peopl that work here are super nice 

mi boyfriend absolut ador the cake i got him from here it was a littl pricey but it made him realli happi hes a chocol freak  so it was worth it

overal it a place ill keep go when i have that i need a bake good fix pong pong has been here forev the food is cheap chines food but usual has realli good flavor they have all the standard dish  

the onli bad thing is they use part r part chicken i usual end up have a discard pile thx ryan c but can deal with it 

just do not go expect great high end dine 

they do delivmake great success the pizza by napoli way

1 find a major road in this case thunderbird and set up shop at the nearest avail crossroad dont worri about locat though given the size of phoenix the chanc that youll be a fiveminut drive from at least three other dinein pizza place is pretti low

2 decor the place onc and leav it in the pizza game you can never look too vintage

3 the one or two guy with the heaviest accent put them on the regist you want to look authentic

4 dont wast time worri about a divers menu just serv the same pizza and wing as your competit peopl dont eat pizza for the tast they eat it for nostalgia and with that decadesold decor and old world accent nobodi will be more nostalg than you baby

5 charg extra for everyth soda refil ranch cup when they gotta pay fifti cent more for it it tast better it scienc 

6 sinc your right by asu west whi dont you offer a lunch special for all of those hungri student hey now dont get ahead of yourself just offer two slice of your most generic in this case chees pie at a reduc price if you make the slice light enough theyll spring for a third or some wing after eat aramark food the other four day a week colleg student will pay stupid coin for authent pizza with a quirki retro feel 

7 dont tell anyon that your actual from albania and not sicili youll lose your street cred

8 uhw thought we could stretch this out to 10 but that realli all you need oh if you want you can set up an arcad machin prefer one of a yup you guess it a 2d fighterse your get where were come from in the corner just in case they dont want to spend their fifti cent to refil their mountain dew youll get those bastard one way or another

9veri nicedig it  35 star  the chicken parm was decent portion for decent price but im not get my friend italian gramma on the phone or anything
th sauc was the best part sweet and basily
th daili fresh bake bread they call a smiley was great but should have been serv warm not fridg cold in order to appreci it flavor and textur  
i will go back but i will have to tri out some other item such as the array of hot or cold sammich befor i can say im a fan

read the histori of the place on the back of the menu was a littl dri until get to the part about some poor schlepp who got shot in the restaur in a previous locat and then a few year later plummet his car over a cliff edg  weirdthis is your grandpa chines restaur  dont take that the wrong way  it just that the decor feel to me like it is out of the 60s or 70s  like mayb the restaur could have been use as a set in the movi dirti danc  you know when babi and her beau sneak off to town for some chow mien

th food vari overal it was decent not great  the price were reason and the servic was kind of slow

w had crab puff and an egg roll for starter  they fall at about 200 star  the entre we had  lobster with black bean sauc emperor beef chines fri chicken and pork fri rice  the lobster meat was tender  i didnt care for the sauc   it look and tast like egg drop soup with some black bean stir in  15 star  the beef was in a mild brown sauc over assort veget  it was tasti but need heat to set it off  25 star  i did not like the chines fri chicken as it was overdon and tast strong of the fri oil  2 star  you should know that my wife did like it despit point out that it was a littl chewi  the pork fri rice was veri good with bbq pork in good quantiti  375 star  take the 5 rate list abov total them up divid by five and you have the true rate 235 star  

just below averagi have a loveh relationship with this market if you surviv the park lot and the million of peopl tri to get the good then you walk away with great deal most of the veggi are fresh and amaz price there were some thing that are a littl more like the bread they have a good select of local honey at good price it is worth check out if you are local and are will to eat whatev they have that is good that week i got a great deal on red pepper 5 for 1 and they were perfect to roast for my marinara sauc the zucchini and squash were great as well howev the yellow and orang pepper were no gooddrop by this locat for lunch one day  at first glanc at the sign i thought it was an erto restaurantso i was hope to add to my list but ala i was wrong  anyway back to the foodi ordered

th food came out a short while later and i start with the carn asada tacoit is a pretti big portion for street taco  the portion size was the onli posit thoughth meat was blandand the guacamol and pico de gallo that was on the taco didnt help much

next was the carnita taco  this one had slight more flavor and was a littl better than the carn asadahowev it was averag at best

last but not least was the beansricechees burrito  this was veri good  some mexican joint like these have oili brc burritosbut not here  there was no oil and the ingredi tast fresh  the tortilla was veri good as well

overal my experi here was average3 star  if i do come back it would be strict for the brc burrito

return factor  50perfect decent italian food that get multipl visit due to a general lack of italian competit in the east valley  the pizza are simpl and tasti  the crust is somewhat distinct and is more like lavosh than the typic crust that most peopl have becom accustom to  the seafood pasta was similar  simpl and fair tasti  while none of our dish have realli explod with flavor they do make good dish that merit a return visitseem that the entre are about 5 more than youd pay elsewher but your pay extra for the atmospher  howev if you plan on eat insid be prepar that the nois level may be quit loud as it echoes

you never know when youll find yourself sit akin to a girl night out tabl with sever shrill voices

their flavor pork verd will bring us back but next time well wait for the patiothree time i have stop by here in the hope of get a bite to eat and was disappoint again they were close  mayb next tripwhat can i say meh

it a diner theme to indiana  im amaz that they stay in busi with that theme but what the hey

th food is normal diner food good and greasi i love that old diner feel  they have that in my opinion disgust biscuit  gravi which is design to make hooiser the fattest peopl on earth  i had bacon and egg as im not hoosier im just a captiv there

thi place is ok but i wont go there again  i was brought here as a joke becaus i was visit from indiana  there is noth here that i cant get at 10000 other place in phoenix except high cholesterolwhen you place your order and your waiter give you a strang omg look you know someth got to be go on

i order biscuit and gravi 2 biscuit and gravi the waiter gave me the look are you sure

umm whi is someth wrong

hav you ever had our biscuit and gravi he snicker back

no

oh well one biscuit is about this hold hand around his face big

il have one then thanks

snick snort snicker i thought you might chang your mind

thi place was busi and i didnt think it was so good it greasi spoon breakfast but it doesnt quit have itok so we went back tonight for dinner i have to say i was pretti peev that they rais their price  so now when i order just one shrimp taco it came out to 490 with tax and all  are you flippin kid me  it about 5 shrimp chipotl cream salsa red cabbag and corn tortilla for five dollar  no way i mean theyr pretti damn good taco for be hundr of mile away from the shore but 5 dollar for one taco  that a bit presumptu 

like i said befor im not expect 99c valu meal price but im also not pay scottsdal price for a tacothe son and i tri elmer last night for the first time  figur he could see what the place is about so he know where he can dash to for lunch from chs

he got the asada burrito which he said tast good   i got the green beef hot burrito  it was tasti but veri messi  i had to grab a fork and knife to finish

they have a pretti decent size menu  price are dirt cheap   hand down they beat guedo becaus they offer chip and salsa and take debit card  food price and counter help is better at elmer too

not the cleanest of place  definit hole in the wall  the smoosh food on the floor by our tabl kinda got to meanoth chain i have visit recent  good place to catch red sox game if you dont have an mlb packag with your cabl or direct tv  

if you need to take proactiv step in order to consum a food is that good  i realli like the habanero mango sauc  on thursday they have 60 chicken finger boneless wing and i have gone a coupl time and had them with the habanero sauce

problem is the sauc is veri hot  spici hot  when you eat it  as it work it way through your system  as it work it way out of your system  spicy

if you order wing ask for them crispi  they will cook them a littl more and give them the nice crunchi just like at home

oth than wing and boneless and beer buffalo wild wing is probabl a two star joint3 star for aok is spot on for coffe island  my cafe mocha was not bad not outstanding

th person make the coffe was painstak slow  in the time it took him to make a mocha and a cappuccino his fellow employe went in the back and made a tasti croissant sandwich with fluffi egg lot of chees and some bacon  did i mention they make pretti good sandwiches

unfortun for coffe island the guy behind me was pretti irrit that it took like 10 minut to get his coffe when they were not busyjust veri slow make espresso drinks

i will definit give coffe island anoth tri  hope the new barista will develop some kind of routin or someth  he should go watch the folk at the two coffe rush locationsfastest  coffe guy in the westtheir commerci are everywher but i had to go to arizona to actual tri some

it not bad but it wasnt that great either i got the 5 a bacon cheeseburg toaster with tot and a drink 629 the burger was alright the tot seem a bit dry

ar we suppos to tip the waiter that rollerblad to your car window i think that was the first time i ever gave a tip at a fast food restaurthe breakfast club sound like and look like it go to be the best local place in town unfortun i find it to be just average

mayb it just me becaus it alway pack  even today on a thursday morn around 10am in the heat of the summer it was pretti crowded

anyway the food is decent but i flat out receiv the wrong omelet today  i order the mushroom fontina chees omelet and i was given the mushroom turkey avocado and chees omelet instead  oh well  it was good but not exact what i order  i will say the portion are pretti big and they are ok with substitut normal the omelet come with potato and fruit and i request toast and tomato slice instead  coffe is decent and servic ok asid from deliv the wrong omelet

tiffani c and i were pretti hungri and this certain did the job of fill our belli but i probabl will not rush back anytim so soon  as alicia say meh not aw not amaz not worth a long wait but decent if you dont have high expectugghhhhh breakfast club  whi did you chang the most homey comfort warm breakfast spot in the phoenix area whi  grandios vision now it cold and corpor  

the local are just program sheep  i love you so 8 month ago befor you sold out  

at least your coffe is still the bomb

you just went off my top ten list  what the hell do i even need to visit scottsdal anymor for i had a good breakfast here but even though i have an expens account when i travel for work im still not comfort pay excess for what is ultim a run of the mill breakfast i had the cinnamon french toast a side of scrambl egg serv lukewarm coffe and orang juic and my bill with tip was 25 on the bright side the servic was a lot better than the yelp consensus just not enough to warrant such a steep price 

add molli ringwald to the equat and it would be well worth it but without her this breakfast club is just a pedestrian experi pose as someth it notit your averag mcdonald  fast servic averag fast food  i was run around and need a quick lunch so i went through the drive through and order 2 mcdoubl from the valu menu the other day  it a mcdonald so my expect arent high

not bad for less than 250

return factor  50still reliabl decent  food is just okay in my book  i dont care for either the red or the green chile or their suppos awardwin tamal but i am a fan of the tijuana taco and their guacamol tostada the latter most becaus they heap on a ton of guac and i can convinc myself they are heart healthi and eat it all guiltfree

pretti bad servic tonight for the last half of our meal but i cant blame the server  somehow he got stuck with a tabl of 810 all straggl in separ and indecis plus two other tabl arriv at the same time  i actual saw our server run through the restaur and i mean run  yet we saw plenti of other employe virtual comatos  nice teamwork there  on the plus side  my husband was lucki enough to catch a glimps of arizona next parent of the year dig the fruit out of her cocktail and feed it to her babi  at least give the babi her own drink  geezhmm  it was okay but i didnt think it was great

w dine in and the interior match the exterior so i had high hope this hole would serv some tasti grub  i went with the flauta dinner which were realli more of a roll taco  to me there is a differ though perhap that just my experi  i expect the roll taco to be tight roll with a fill with more of a is this beef or chicken textur  the flauta would be fatter with shred beef or chicken  no worri im equal happi with both  and while the flauta was good i was not over fond of the somewhat bland avocado green sauc atop  i did think the bean were excel and would definit return for those alone
i also had a bite of my husband gordita and thought they were excess greasi and should have been drain a littl more  

overal i was general pleas and wouldnt mind go back sometim to tri someth els  i did wonder though how there could be so mani slash in the vinyl seat when there are onli plastic knive availwhat the 
am i realli the first to review this spot 
there have to be about 150 yelper within an 5 block radius of this place but no review make me want to grab a can of spray paint and tag them
al righti then here goes
i dont alway need to make my own lunch or go someplac fun for lunch sometim you just need a good servic sandwich or a bowl of soup for a quick decent lunch someplac that isnt a drivethru isnt greasi i suppos they could add greas if that how you roll congest i mean in the automot sens rather than then bronchial sensealthough the fume from most drive drive thrus make me long for a plug sinus
pacif is a sweet littl famili run appar they speak passabl english and they alway have troubl understand me when i tell them my sandwich was terrifica nice touch is that they all bow when i thank themthey are beyond ador operation
they make as note abov a realli servic sandwich im fond of the egg salad with some chop oliv on it and decent soup as well the place is veri clean they alway hustl out to wipe down tabl even though they are busi behind the counter make sandwich etc and smell good too like a good food joint should
i know they also do breakfast which i cannot comment onif i go out to breakfast i want to make count with someth like the breakfast joynt or matts
thi littl spot isnt easi to find frank it has an indian school rd address but it 12 block north of the street in the offic complex by anoth one of the statu of winfield scott we should start a new game and see if we cant find and count all of the statu to the scottsinclud that delight paean to mrs scott in the parkyou know the one with her on the hors look like she has the worst case of constip in american history
at ani rate tri to find this place and have a sandwich it pretti good food fresh prepar like subway onli clean and nice at a good priceanoth poem although not by popular demandit just the voic in my head demand attention

i stop for some lunch at the old orang table
they alway have savori food
it was crowd as hell even in summer
so the servic was not veri good

th wait staff is hip and they sort of act cool
bi their look i could tell i was not
i was wear a golf shirt and old cargo shorts
they just didnt think i was hot

they chat with friend and hung out in the kitchen
but they did bring my soup hot and tasty
and a good turkey sandwich with lettuc and mayo
th bread was just right thick and crusty

so would i return to the tabl of orange
oh sure they are right in my hood
th food is just fine all fresh and well made
but id have to be in a great moodwell usual i excus poor servic to a certain degre but our last trip to the orang tabl was remark bad as far as servic is concern we wait near 20 minut befor someon came over to our tabl and as mani of you know this is not a big place then when our waiter did come he just kind of stood there and said wassup for a second i thought i was go to have to spell it out for him well we just came here to eat some food which is what were attempt to do right now 

thank god the food is still great so for now were onli gonna downgrad orang tabl by one star down to a three out of five our burger and sandwich were damn good as was our cream soda but the highlight of this visit without a doubt the fact that our waiter is a glorifi youtuber tv star well not in a good way and i guess im exagger quit a bit when i say star anyon rememb that episod of cheater where the goofi dude with the mullet had this uberattract girlfriend onli to cheat on her not veri help i guess this describ a lot of episod of cheater anyway the dude get interview and spout off this gem

i do chick man that just what i do 

he then spout off all sort of other nonsens tri to show that he is the man of all men which he clear isnt 

the clip was featur on the soup and a bunch of other show and was cring induc becaus you wonder how a mullet sport piec of white trash could nab the type of girl he was with and not onli that but find more women to cheat on her with it onli shit you could see on crappi realiti tv 

anyway that dude now wait tabl at the orang tabl and was our waiter the other day so now you know at least one reason whi the servic isnt exact grade aad a star becaus ive unlock the secret to servic  new year eve midafternoon  we were head to smoca and look for a quick bite  orang tabl was definit not at the top of the list  but i look in and onli one tabl was occupi so we took a shot  upon arriv the server was on a person call but she actuallywait for ithung up to seat us and took our order with a smile

now you still wont find speedi gonzal in the kitchen no that is not a 1070 refer but with no order ahead of you the wait is down to a manag 30 minut or less

i split a steak  bleu and a prosciutto melt  they were both except good although i think i prefer the steak  bleu  too bad i have to wait until next new year eve to feel comfort with the servic again70313

ive dine here by myself and with an aunt prior to today meal and im surpris i havent updat my 09 review yet  when i stumbl onto those photo some are date 2012 i will have to add them with accompani review hope soonish

brought mom and visit sis and her two kid with me for breakfast and seat ourselv in harper section  we assum he was new sinc it took awhil for him to greet us hello with our menus and glass of water that kept slip from his grasp and land with thud and splash of water on the tabl  we had to ask him on his return visit to take our order to wipe up the spill mayb becaus of his nervous he forgot to wipe up the spill automat  i order a mocha httpwwwyelpcombizphotosorangetablescottsdaleselecttv17tplqu8jwzweocilqtv17tplqu8jwzweocilq and was ask for the first time ive been here a few time in the past few month if i prefer whole 2 or nonfat milk  i assum i was serv whole milk in the past so i decid to tri one with 2  sister order the mexican chocol coffe and everyon els had water or soda  here is what we all ordered

a i order the french toast and the red flannel mom mention that she and i were go to share the french toast and my sister place their order of corn beef hash niec buttermilk cake nephew with one of the cake with chocol chip extra charg of cours and the white flannel for her  i ask if i could chang my wheat bread select to oliv and harper said yes but the oliv toast end up on sister plate  we had to remind him of my side of bacon and sausag  the french toast didnt have enough banana and i wish i rememb to ask for some banana place on top of the toast as well as whatev slice come in the whiskey sauc itself which came with sub almond  the lack of banana was a littl disappoint so i suggest to request extra banana the name of the dish is banana foster yes  the red flannel wouldv been veri good but it felt undercook  definit mushi in textur and not as texturallysatisfi as the order of green flannel my aunt had back in novemb 12 i tri a littl portion of it and like the crisp edg  also all of the flannel we order today look slight disappoint mayb there a new cook  no one ate the flannel leftov we brought home howev sister like her white flannel entre  the flannel did tast better when eaten with sour cream

th chocol chip pancak was delici  nephew isnt a big eater so i was abl to tri some thank good ot serv 100 pure mapl syrup as well as some of the leftov at home  id say the highlight of breakfast that morn were the side of nuesk bacon and one sausag and the oliv toast  my mocha made with 2 milk wasnt popular with anyon includ me so id suggest order it with whole milk leftov mocha keep well in the fridg for at least a week  sister  had to add sugar to her mexican chocol coffe to enjoy it  she tri it without sugar the way i drink my coffe and it was toler but definit better with splenda  

everyon enjoy the atmospher and the couch and with a few tweak this couldv been a fourstar  good luck to harperfirst i think it import to rememb what lacademi is this is scottsdal culinari institut casual bistrostyl restaur as such everi encount with staff is an encount with a student from the host stand to the tabl servic to the kitchen 

last night we spot the fruit and chees plate on the dessert tabl upon our entranc you see while the menu is season mayb to coincid with semest the dessert are chang out more frequent to allow for creativ of the student chef the offer are display along with some featur beverag which you are forc to pass as you enter the dine room a great way to remind you to save room wink wink i guess you could say we had dessert first

our starter featur slice of manchego and wedg of blue chees and a smokey brie border by walnut pistachio dri fig apricot and cranberri and halv red and green grape onli real complaint there were too few piec of crostini although we were gracious brought more upon request and some of the green grape had brown overal it was a nice way to start the meal

i had the five onion soup a velveti potag the soup aroma was slight better than it flavor a bit heavi on the pancetta and worcestershir for my taste

th present of the crab cake  was love three timbal of crab and pepper surround a small bunch of fresh green bound by a tomato slice the vinaigrett on the green was a highlight

lacademi has a notabl wine select i was delight to find molli dooker 2007 the maitr d cabernet sauvignon on the list delici oak goodness

truth be told it feel like a cross between a classroom and an averag american bistro but you know what that what it is and what better way to support young peopl who love food as much as we do and want to spend their career bring it to usalison b and i met here for revers happi hour last week  befor we decid to move to the patio it was too noisi earlier she order a peach martini made w sake and i a glass of red diamond merlot  alison was feel like have the kona calamari hh price 5  it been year sinc i had kgs and i couldnt recal if i like it but i mention that if we move to the bar or patio that happi hour would start in fifteen minut and we could order that and someth els at happi hour price  it took a littl armtwist but alison relent   

whi did i stay away for so long  oh yeah i rememb now mom and i use to frequent chandler kg our first two year in the valley but it just got harder and harder to find an empti tabl at the barpatio plus it was alway so noisi  i realli like scottsdal locat not too noisi outsid especi if your lucki enough to snap up a tabl at a corner or at the outer edges

 and she order a budlight 2 and i a glass of hous red merlot 4  food and libat were delishwhat you gonna do it fast food veri basic and devoid of charact  the onli save grace here is the communal salsa bar  sure fine this place is alright not disgust or the best ever  just as averag as you can geti cannot believ that i am the ftr ds  from what i hear ds has been an old town landmark for a long time now at least 4 year  it use to be a circl k  ds is that place you can go for pretti much anyth at most hour of the day  at least the hour that ive need them  

smoke  go to ds
beer  go to ds
bottl water  go to ds
tampon  go to ds
diet coke  go to ds
ice cream  go to ds
munchi  go to ds

you get the point
d is the conveni store closest to our new place  im alreadi thank for ds and im sure ill be a regular in no timehmm a bit disappoint i had been here sever time when i use to live in scottsdal but that was 3 year ago and i must say that i think thing have gone downhil here the bruschetta top on the combin platter were odd for the most part with the except of the tradit fresh tomato and basil which was delici and worth mention the provolon on the sausag bruschetta was excess and the overal combin of flavor just didnt work the pesto bruschetta was super garlicheavi even for someon like me who love garlic i couldnt finish either of the latter type of bruschetta 

onto the main cours  pizza had the toscana which has mozzarella tomato sauc mushroom and sausag the crust was burnt and flavorless and the top just seem kind of bland and strang oldtast i mean not fresh weird i know 

i sort of like the red sangria but it was a somewhat odd twist on sangria as it was pretti sweet and not veri strong 

i am sorri grazi i am spoil by have had the best pizza on earth in chicago and am too excit to tri the other acclaim pizza joint in phoenixscottsdal to return to your restaurmayb it me but ive had the worst luck with custom servic at everi kfc i go to hawaii was a joke but i cant figur out what locat it was to write a review 
anyway this kfc is probabl the next worst with custom servic this littl brunett woman was the worst i had to repeat my order like 5 time and i could hear her laugh and talk with anoth employe through the speaker so she kept have to ask me what was that with a rude attitud i final pull up to the window to place my order face to face she then went to repeat my order that i just told her and thing were still wrong serious at least my final correct order was edibl 1 star for servic and 2 star for the food blahi get a kick out of everyon rave about the omgfabul ice cream at the sugar bowl hey mayb it great but when i work there in the not too distant past there one thing i rememb about the ice cream in those big freezer buckets

it dreyers

that edi for you east coast transplants

so if you dont feel like deal with the crowd or the indiffer wait staff trundl off to your neighborhood basha and pick up a pint of the same stuff theyr scoop at the sugar bowl

but mayb you dont feel like deal with the crowd and the staff but you also dont want to have a coupl of gallon of ice cream in the freezer to  replic that perfect banana split so go alreadi you could do with get out of the hous now and then the wait arent that long and indiffer is a long way from surly

also just to clear up some confus from a few review down the scottsdal locat has been the flagship store for decad the outlet on central  camelback was a product of the earli 90s

updat 03232008 just want to updat with a quick stori about how i got fire from the central  camelback locat in 1991 not sure how much it chang if at all the neighborhood had a huge conting of peopl with more money than manner and they love the sugar bowl so if you happen to have a moder wealthi femal relat in your famili with a tale of get whack up side the head with an ice cream scoop at the old downtown phoenix sugar bowl trust me on this one she had it come and i hope shes sinc learn how to behav in publicthe gigant pink build  we stop in this place for some ice cream one afternoon  it old school and has stool at the counter like an old fashion soda fountain   i got a walnut fudg sunda and my buddi got a banana split  my sunda was pretti good  just the right amount of ice cream and top  everyon we encount was nice and friend  a tad steep  15 buck for ice cream but it was good enoughlook for an old school ice cream parlor experi with a ton of old town histori  this is your place

with simpl menu offer from ice cream and sunda special creation milkshak and malt your sure to get your sugar fix on and if your in the mood for someth savori they offer a limit select of salad sandwich and burger too  i cant speak to the food offer though  

on a recent visit for a friend birthday i went with a scoop of their ice cream flavor of the day it happen to be pumpkin and a slice of their homemad banana nut bread  both were sweet and edibl and serv are pretti generous too  i must admit howev that neither blew me away  we sat in the arcad area and servic was attent enough but i cant say ill be rush back  

there is someth to be said for the old school feel of this place but im a sucker for all of the mani frozen yogurt and even soft serv ice cream place out there nowaday 

mi advic go to sugar bowl everi now and again for the overal experi and dont think about your diet when your there  enjoythis is the first yelp review ive ever realli agon over 

the sugar bowl is an old town scottsdal class 
bright pink exterior and old fashion letter in the window 
the interior has the same kitchi charm famili circus comic all over cute old fashion bricabrac in the store and on the wall 

but the food the food is well aw 
i order the assort finger sandwich  and the bread was stale and in addit to tuna salad and egg salad there is some kind of ham salad when i ask about what was in the finger sandwich tell me a ham sandwich might have been more acurat describ as a ham salad sandwich  i took a bite and left the rest alon 

the ice cream is good noth special
th sunda are fun again noth special 

but there is someth that make me bring my out of town guest here when a trip to cold stone might be tastier 

i hope someon come in improv the menu but keep the charmone word sum it updisappointing

thi was my first time here and im not all that anxious to return  my hubbi and i were head to the galleri and decid to have lunch at cowboy ciaomi idea sinc the review were larg positive

w both order a bore 7up befor see all the specialti soda avail  the one time it would have been help had our server been a slacker  i order the tenderloin sandwich with roast red pepper and blue chees  the tenderloin was tender and flavor  the roll that it was serv on was toast yet still rubberi in textur  not chewi like good crusti bread but rubberi  like they had microwav it   my husband had the ahi sandwich  i didnt tri it but i could tell it was a littl skimpi on the ahi  his came with a side of potato salad which i did tri  i like it but felt it need salta lot of it  too bad there was none on the table

i thought cowboy ciao has a nice menu and i might be inclin to give it anoth shot sometim but i was definit not blown away  just okay for mehave i ever share my issu with microwav befor i know i am a creep but i realli dislik microwav food i almost had a meltdown when my expens green chile burro was place in the microwav 

it was 11 and it not even fresh is it cold i watch you scoop it onto the tortilla it wasnt from the fridg and if it wasnt hot to servedo that mean it was at the perfect temperatur for food born bacteria  

also dont you know microwav make tortilla all funki and weird textur 

while it was microwav i was abl to check out the dri crusti filth on all of the applianc evid of cook and not clean yuck  i realli need to stop look at stuff like that 

luckili i was abl to talk myself out of be a total nut job and i ate it i was onli abl to eat  some of it becaus 1 it was ef huge and 2 the imag of the crusti splatter kept pop into my head regardless it was so tasti 

mi favorit green chile burro use  to be from espo but i have other issu with espo  this burro compar and while not total clean and it be overpr and the fact that they microwav itit was realli realli realli good 
like good enough for me to give this place 3 star 

i like my green chile burro made with shred beef none of that weird cube meat for me  and they deliv on that aspect

i honest dont know if im capabl of go again but if your more hardcor than i am and you are down with the get down the i say munch uplook for quick moder price mexican in old town

el molino is your answer

it noth fanci but it hit the spot  ive had chip and salsa guac a chicken taco salad and most recent a bean and chees burro i hear the breakfast burrito are pretti delici as well so i may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover

eith way el molino is a step up from fast food but it no frill  oh and the peopl in the yelp offic are huge fan they are the one that turn me on to it  gracia amigoim with michael on this place  i dont get the ador of this place  it alway pack  peopl fall all over themselv to prais these cashon schmuck 

so who the eff care that this place is cash onli  i do 

restaur like this stick out like a sore thumb in phoenix i hard ever carri cash  i know  bad habit  but pleas origin pancak hous buy a flippin credit card merchant machin thing and rais your price on everyth by 75 cent  it realli inconveni luckili there are mani other breakfast place who accept debitcredit card in the immedi area over easi orang tabl etc

i dont care for pancak so im no expert on them but i usual order the chorizo scrambl here and give my pancak to my dine partner good egg to chorizo ratio on the scrambl  veri quick servic onc your seat but the wait can be long on occas  it all good though becaus dure your wait you can marvel and analyz the uber60 architectur of the interiormy experi at the roar fork dure restaur week was peculiar  it difficult for me not to take on the judgement of my codin but im go to tri to limit this to my experi only

it took forev to get order our drink and actual receiv them  all i want was an ice tea and i receiv my drink last and it was given to my codin seat 4 seat away from me  and while we were wait for our drink to arriv incred slowli and onebyon i start to get realli realli hungri  im wait for the guy to take our order but he hasnt even brought all the drink yet but he has brought a huge basket of bread  so i start munch on bread which was soso

fin he take our order for appet and entre  and it take forev for someth of which they probabl have a big vat sit in the kitchen  but it eventu come out 7 green pork chili and a tortilla soup except wait a minut they onli brought out 6 green pork chili and a tortilla soup  so again i wait and wait for my waiter to come check on us 10 minut or longer after everyon els is serv i final get my appetizer

and it was realli good tender piec of pork in a slight spici green chili sauc smother with a ton of jalapeno jack chees serv in a littl cauldron with three larg butteri tortilla  but it was enough food to be the entre  if i had known it was go to be this larg i would have order the salad

then it take awhil for everyon to finish plate to be clear and entre to be brought out  we were seat at 730 it now close to 9

but then it final arriv  my rainbow trout with almond slice and caper with a piec of jalapeno cornbread  the fish was almost as larg as the platter easili 4 serv if veget were includ on the platter but there wasnt  im veri curious to find out if this is how they normal serv their food becaus im not use to get a big plate of meat with noth els  again it was delici  light batter and smokey it almost tast meati it was so rich this fish was yummerriffic

then it time for the dessert not that ani of us have room for dessert but it part of the packag  the server inform us that there are onli 3 creme brule left  luckili onli two of our crowd want this dessert but it was just anoth way that i was a littl disappoint with the servic  i order the chocol lava browni with vanilla ice cream  it was pretti good  not phenomen but good

i love my food and mayb i would check out a happi hour  it a shame that the servic was so mediocr becaus this restaur could easili have won me over with their food  and i never would have gone here if it wasnt restaur weeki had the opportun to dine with some fabul fellow yelper at the roar fork last night while the night was fun and full of laugh the fork just didnt deliver

our group of 9 peopl had a dinner reserv for 730pm let me first hit on our reserv becaus of seat limit jenn w and i had to make 2 separ reserv and they were made through open tabl we each note our reserv with each other name and state that we want to be seat next to each other i also note that we were yelp member and that we want the az restaur week menu  we receiv a confirm etc

our full parti arriv and it was dinner time i was starv at that point we were seat at 2 separ tabl that were next to each other we decid it was silli to sit a foot away from each other and put some muscl into move our tabl togeth 

our server joshua took our water order veri quick unfortun that was about all he did quick and accur all night our actual drinkcocktail order was pain slow both in be abl to order it and deliveri plus a random diet coke show up in the midst of our order at this point we didnt want our drink we want food a coupl of bread basket were deliv with soso varieti of bread my favorit was the cheddar bacon biscuit it was just interest to me after we deplet our carb basket we hope that our food order would fare better and get to us quickly

it was time for the first cours everyon first cours was deliv except for one jenn w was left to sit and wait an unreason amount of time for her order in fact instead of make sure everyon had what they need our waiter deliv anoth tabl appet first and walk away big no no jenn final receiv her order and i could final dig into my food without guilt

 i order the green chile stew fantast i love it it had the right amount of spici kick the meat was tender and not at all fatti and the tortilla that came with it were hot and butteri i could have just gone straight to dessert after that i was veri pleas with my appetizer

what goe up must come down right well my bliss high was broken up by my bore rotisseri chicken meal i was hope that the chicken might be moist and smoki or mayb rub with some interest spice no i know ive had a better season and more moist rotisseri chicken from a groceri store yes i said it 

i did have the chanc to steal bite of the trout from jenn w and matthew k how i regret order the chicken the trout was moist and meati and full of so much flavor it was silli i also had a few bite of amanda bs short rib dish the sauc on the short rib was tasti and smoki the short rib itself was almost too fatti i know short rib are suppos to have some fat content but this was like eat blubber in some bite not appet i had high hope for my dessert

our dinner dish were final clear away and we were left to chat for a bit befor our dessert order was taken i had the molten chocol browni with vanilla ice cream meh the browni wasnt exact as molten as i expect and consid my ice cream was larg melt i was hope the whole browni was warm nope the melt ice cream was possibl our speedi waiter handiwork

our waiter was kind enough to allow split bill and there was no problem in mix up tab or anyth which was great 

i think i will go back to the roar fork for a happi hour or to tri some of their more creativ dish mayb a basic chicken dish threw them for a loop i hope they can wow me next time with someth differi join sever yelperz for the uye restuant week excurs it was so much fun sit there and laugh around with everyon joke about godknowswhat if it werent for the compani  this would have been a terribl night 

the food was good my green chile pork stew was good and i enjoy it howev it made my date sick poor thing but my brais beef rib were a huge chunk of meat lol and it was so fatti a good 25 of it was fat gross but the beef was fall off the bone and veri good my creme brule was just creme brule noth great outstand or amaz heck carraba creme brule is better ha 

the servic was atroci i never had such slow servic the waiter was friend and a lil bit of a smartass which was actual realli refresh and realli nice but man he was way off his game we wait over 30 minut between cours and everi singl cours someon was left out there was one less soup one less entre one less dessert everi time someon would have to wait for their food i felt bad each time and realli it was uncal for i want to just go off on the manag who i saw spend over 20 minut suck up to a differ tabl and want to onli spend 2 minut with us but ala i didnt want to scare my fellow yelper and chose not to say anyth doubl grrrrr 

bi then of the night  i spent over 120 on a meal for two the most i have ever spent on one singl dinner ugh is this what it feel like to be a man and got know some more of my fellow yelper which of cours make it worth it 

straight up  ill never go back it waay too far it waay too expens and the servic is waaaaaywaaaay too shiti and is not worth the gas money and time to go there if i have to pay over 60 a head the servic better be fuck great cuz straight up the food wasnt that good to where id look over all their flaw and go anyway methink noti read the news todayoh boy

glenn bell jr die this past weekend at the tender age of 86a long life of slingin taco to be sure

i hadnt been to taco bell in almost 4 year until todayi was move to drop by taco bell in a sort of tribut to glennon of the more promin voic dure my format years

thi taco bell in particularstor  22354 is one of the more import spiritu touch point for pay tribut to glennscottsdal was the home of the first taco bell franchis and the fact that westaco inc hq is in the same lot with this store make them the defacto if not actual heir to the legaci of glenn bell

i had my first taco bell taco in corval oregon in 1970 when i hit colleg with a mighti crash

it was the second time i had ever had mexican foodth first time was a week prior at a place call taco time in eugen oregon

i was thrill to find out about pizza italian food pizza mexican pizza chines take out pizzayou get the drifti was a countri boy in the for me big citi and i was go to find out all about life pleasuresstart with tacos

i was hook on taco bell for a long time a time that coincident was the time when i had veri littl money yet still need to eat occasionally

taco bell and the other fill the role of reason tasti mainten eat for a long long timeit was a truism in 1975 that no oneno one could eat 500 worth of taco bell at a sit all by themselves

couldnotb done

it may still be truish with the cheapo menu

but it has never realli been veri good

that was someth i actual didnt discov until a trip to la with a girlfriend the same trip that i discov innoutr mexican food is veri differ than the goop that glenn had sold me over the yearsand veri much better

but that didnt stop me from eat at taco bellbeggar cant be choosersand i was a beggar for a few years

today was a nostalgia stop for me as was my last visit to a taco bell a few year ago as well as a tribut to glenn

i was more interest in watch my beefi burrito be made this timeth ladi in the kitchen pull various lever in respons to the computer instruct for my order on the monitor overheadth differ shade of unidentifi goop that cascad onto the flour tortillasth quick hand movement of their ritual wrap of the burrito i onc date a girl that work at taco bellsh knew how to wrap a burritobut that anoth story

it still isnt veri good foodbut everyon at this locat is sweet and pleasant my order was correct i was in sever need of a retox after a 6 miler this morn and i did manag to eat about 23 of the burritoeven with mulitpl bag of hot sauc it was not veri good

but that not the fault of the sweet ladi behind the counter nor of westaco nor of glenn belli think when pepsi or yum or whoever got their hand on taco bellwellim not write this to get on a rant about corpor agenda vs quality

i want to give them an extra starjust for be who they are and where they are but i hear the spirit of glenn bell tell me dont do it donaldmak them earn it 

that all i need anoth voic in my headthank glenneven bad mexican food is good  that what i alway say  this place is pretti good actual  i realli like the tortillasbig and thin  remind me of the tortilla i use to eat from a mexican bakeri when i was littl  the kind  that are so big you can punch hole in them and wear them  hey it fun when your 5

anyway i do like the food overal  i realli like the fact there a drivethru so when im look and feel my worst i dont have to worri about peopl think the last thing she need is a taco plate  

whi onli 3 star you ask  becaus the meat iswel you know how when you cut up a roast and throw out all the fatti grisli part  i think they comb the street for those part  but they do make em tast pretti darn goodif cleanli is next to godli then the beto is perch on the rim of the 6th circl of hell
that doesnt mean it bad mexican food in fact it decent enough to be a guilti pleasur but you will be guilti you will also not be constip the next morn ahhh the lubric effect of copious amount of anim fat
i was help my daughter buy and assembl some ikea furnitur and i use the word furnitur loos in conjunct with ikea and she bought me lunch at the beto are they a famili or what she didnt realiz that i had been here befor as i saidit a guilti pleasurei dont advertis thing like this as a general rule she had just found it with her roommat as a late night drive through dinner spot
w decid to eat at one of the picnic tabl and when i got out of the truck my first thought was is there a render plant in scottsdal no but you are in the greas trap nexus that exist between whataburg and the beto this is a vortex of decad old cook greas molecul that will swirl between these 2 establish and surviv until the next ice age freez them for our ancestor to study
mi carn asada taco were pretti decentgreasi and tasti i got some hot sauc can it be call hot sauc if it not either thingjust wonderingi suppos tomatoey water doesnt hit the right market button whit had a coupl of chees enchilada we were full to the brim and on our way to recov from ikea assembl just what i need to slide pun intend into the weekendi was on a mission from god veri small g today and need a quick retox

lo beto fill that role withwait for itthre roll taco and a coke

and yes retoxifi they werechock full of greasi cheesi and salsa cover goodness

mi roll taco were veri edibleand they didnt get my order wrong more than i can say about a certain redhead burger jointbut realli how can you screw up the roll tacosyou cant

just for place like this ive creat a chart with the crap to qualiti ratio in honor of ryan csee photo attachedyou wouldnt believ how difficult it is to attach a chart

although origin develop by ryan c in his secret lair to ass qualiti  and quantiti  of boofay ive discov these calcul work quit nice for ani type of greasi divey suspect shadi oddbal sketchi rough funni smell bizarr foreign wacki oddbal outré and outrag eateries

thank ryan
 
bon appetiti havent been yelp much latelytoo too busy

but happili busi busi mean money and while the money may not buy happi it will rent you a park space so that you can park the bentley and stroll on over to happinessso more is good

so i was surpris and delight to receiv a missiv from yelp hq in my inboxless so when i broke the seal on my mail and discov that a photo in one of my review had been flag by the yelp communiti and remov becaus it fell outsid the photo guidelin 

which review you askwhi the one direct below this one

i thought for a moment about who would flag a small graphic in an obscur review about a third rate taco stand in south scottsdaleand decid i didnt have a clue

so i went to los beto to do a littl investig and to have lunchthey may be third rate but they still make delight greasi and satisfi roll tacosi had three of the littl boogers

a i saunter up the window i was go to do drive through but then i would miss the full los beto experiencedin under an umbrella in the greas vortex that perpetu swirl between los beto and whataburg plus i need to be on foot to do my best magnum pi investig work

i order my roll taco and salsa and then ask casual hey have you guy flag ani cute littl graph in a yelp review of los beto lately

th sweet littl undocu worker behind the counter either said ¿quién yo or do chu wan rice n beani cant be sure

in ani event the food was as alway decentno one stuck their thumb in my tacos

th servic was fine if incomprehens much like the explan from yelp hq as to whi my littl graph didnt meet photo guidelines

th greas was pretti fresh and now i am lube for days

i guess ill never know the answer to who flag my littl chart or whi although i have my suspicion about the bertosbeto conglomer and their minions

i was go to take a photo of the greas trap behind los beto and post those sinc they are an integr part of the restaur experi when you are sit outsid and subject to the tornado like cloud of cook gass and particul unlik my small chart which while accur describ the crap to good stuff ratio of my meal at los beto appar doesnt qualifybut then i decid mayb ive made enough mischief for one day

or notim a bit picki about thai  mayb that whi im so hard on male it not tradit thai which is not necessarili bad if you dont know the differ or just dont care  

the food here is decent  the atmospher is nicer than most thai place howev for the price the qualiti of the food is a bit lack and inconsist for exampl ill use my favorit male dishth seafood curri ive order it 5 time and 3 xs it was great 2xs the seafood was veri over cook and dri at male price that not kosher

howev one thing i have to give them credit for is serviceit excel  the manag is veri profession courteous and doe an awesom job take care of ani mistak from the kitchen

if you want thai in an atmospher that more upscal than tradit thai restaur tri male if you dont care andor are a cheapskat like me andor desir more tradit thai tri thai basil in tempwe end up here on accid today and decid to give it a tri there were thing we love and thing that were just ok and thing that disappointed

w share a gigant bowl of egg drop soup which normal has chicken in it so we made it vegetarian it was pretti good a tad bland mayb i like it better with a splash of soy sauce

th ice tea was funki i ask specif if it was plain black tea and the waitress said yes it was lipton not so it had some secret ingredi in it that made it cloudi i think it might have been coconut milk i just didnt care for it and wish she had been complet honest from the get go

our entre were ok hubbi had a tofu shanghai noodl dish that was fine but again kind of bland my hous chow fun with chicken beef and shrimp was unlik ani chow fun i have had befor obvious some differ spice were use and it was alright but i prefer other i have had 

the dessert was the standout honey fri banana with peanut butter and coconut ice cream serious sweet and light batter crispi banana with a scoop of intens peanut butter and then one of a mild and yummi coconut ice cream 

we may return as they seem to be veri flexibl on ingredi and prepar just about anyth can be made vegetarian just say no meat add tofu said the waitress ani other ingredi can be left out as well due to allergi or tast preferi go here for coffe never had a donut from this locat  they do amus me becaus i take a coupl minut to fill out the survey on the receipt for a free donut  if you dont want a donut it good for 1 off  i found that out at anoth dunkindonut 

except at this one whenev i order my larg hot or ice coffe and give them the coupon it come out at 29 cent  cool

otherwis this dd is not well run judg from the 67 time ive been in  there is usual a harri middl age guy run around tri to speed thing up and caus confus among the sever young women that also work there and move at a leisur pace  it kind of amus except that the drink get screw up with regularman did anyon els get hit by that power hailtast burst of heavi rain yesterday i was drive to carlsbad tavern when the cloud unleash bucket upon bucket of rain on my car by the time i got there the rain had subsid to a drizzl and it made for the absolut perfect atmospher as i walk up the wooden plank into the cavelik atmospher of carlsbad tavern

but then i look to the right and saw an empti lagoon with tchotchk plastic turtl and fish upend and scatter atop pvc pipe in the concret enclosur i can accept the fact that they wouldnt keep that fill dure the summer though it a wast of water with all the evapor although id realli like to come here when the waterfal moat thingi is function becaus it look like it would be great ambianc for a fun dinner

i got there 15 minut late and end up have to wait anoth 15 minut for my mom and aunt to arriv what can i say were a punctual famili so i saunter up to the bar and order a margarita on the rock with salt sinc it was on happi hour it cost me onli 375 and was a smooth combin of tequila tripl sec and sweet and sour mix for onli four buck this well concoct was one of the better margarita in recent memori chile pepper light around the bar with all sort of bat relat memorabilia manag to be campi fun rather than campi trashi and gave me plenti to observ as i was waiting

feel like the tradit mexican munchi i order the tricolor chip with two salsa this was an unfortun choic the salsa de casa was veri coars chop which made it realli hard to dip or spoon onto a chip and was extrem heavi on tomato with few other discern flavor the tomatillo salsa tast okay but was also chop so coars it was like layer strip of tomatillo on chip the chip werent too bad but they were reminisc of oil theyv been use to crisp chimichanga in for the past week ive work in food servic and i know what old oil tast like

but the convers with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappoint appet and it cost two whop buck so i total got what i paid for although it is a littl disappoint that they dont come complimentary

onc we were seat in the main dine room i was pleas by the atmospher and decor stuf bat hang from the ceil high seat booth with comfi cushion cool copper light fixtur rock wall and a huge floor to ceil rock featur with veget which manag to maintain a cavelik atmospher while still be invit we place our order with a veri friend server that was a natur at make small talk and joke around instead of come off as peev that we were take too long to examin the daili guano i also like the more open end is there anyth i can do for you rather than the usual lead question like can i get you someth to drink do you know what you want to eat

i order the enchant platter so i could tri a littl bit of everyth a chicken enchilada carn adovada burrito a chile rellano and a sopapilla when it came out i was pretti disappoint by the present it was smother in so much sauc and chees that it was difficult to discern just what the hell i had on my plate and it look like my burrito had anoint the surround item with a liber splash of greasi red sauc it most definit could have done with two plate instead of just one 

ill admit it it realli realli piss me off that gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 star instead of 4 i have issu with food present i rearrang everi sandwich i order at a restaur to ensur even distribut of ingredi i dont care if thing are touch and mix it up but it better be do so in an aesthet manner

but onc i dug in it turn out to be a delici meal the chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was delici cheesi with huge chunk of chicken the carn adovada was tender but reli a bit too heavili on some weird tomato flavor that was thicken with what tast like cornstarch solo it was weird but when the burrito entrail leak all over the place it ad a delici flavor to the meal the chile rellano was pure pork and chees a dens and delici concoct nest atop rice and black bean rice was generic black bean were delish and ive got enough leftov for three lunch all for onli 1295 

psst dont get the habenero burger unless you want to shit fire for the next week ive heard that from so mani peopl that it must be true it not serv with a complementari glass of milk for no reasoncarlsbat cavern or rather carlsbad tavern is a campi new mexcian restaurantbar that was the ethnic concess made to me by my parent after plead to go to at least one region appropri restaur dure my visit

what do i mean by campi you ask
 stuf anim bat on the ceil as gob from ad would say come on
 newspap menus headlin the daili guano
 bat sauc a habanerobas hot sauc that was mild consid the base
 a cavethem interior a bar area and a decor poolmoat exterior

aft i assist my shelter famili in translat the unfamiliar menu we consumed
 nacho 6 on hh normal 9 chip were a bit light for the heap toppings
 lobster enchilada 16 disappoint  slight bitter and not much tast overall
 chile relleno 11 pepper stuf with pork and chees tasti but a bit heavy
 green chile mac  chees 6 standard with appreci subtl pepper flavor
 chocol mouss cake 7 too much cake and too much sugar not enough cocoa
 chocol erupt 7 a cake with harden chocol mouss and cheesecak chunk better than the aforement but still over sweet

on happi hour for a meal made of discount appet and 4 margarita i could see this be a fun choic but skip dinner even though admit i am compel by the ampl outdoor moatsid seat and the habanero burger replet with medic warn while i dont feel i wast my restaur select i also dont feel i prospect and struck pay dirt in carlsbad tavern either and im sure gold is out therei met a friend for lunch yesterday 

love the water featur and patio walk in if it had been warmer i would have definit sat outsid 

insid was a littl dark and i guess it was all the bat around but it remind me of dusk till dawn 

we were seat i hope was hope for chip and salsa i guess they dont serv them here 
we werent even offer the one on the menu which i probabl would have declin anyway becaus chip and salsa should be complimentari 

anyhow i order the fresh snapper taco see pic 
there is a lot of fish there be smother by all those pepper but as for everyth els what you see is what you get

for 15 i would have like more than a tbsp of each rice and bean and a definit more than a teaspoon of chees and sour cream and mayb a lime or lemon 
there was more garnish on the plate than anyth other than that it was good 

mi friend order the green chile stew and the green chile mac and chees see pic she has been here befor so knew what she like i tast the macaroni and thought it was pretti good too

il give 3 star until i go back and tri out some other thingwent here for brunch this morn sunday and there were a few thing that diminish the experi for me
 you claim new mexican grub and then you charg for chip and salsa or sopapilla which are standard complement to ani new mexican restaur meal
 at 3 the coffe is  a rip off serious were not talk cappuccino peopl and your sell buildyourown bloodi mari for the same price
 the carn adovada was tender but not veri spicy

that said
 the green salsa was realli good
 im so desper for carn adovada ill settl besid 9 is more than a fair price for 3 egg black bean and carn adovada in a bowl on a flour tortilla  even if it was more bean than pork
 there are sever option for 5 and if they are all like the egg benedict they are generous portions
 the patio is nice and the bar area feel like a neighborhood pub not a cave but that not got to be a bad thingwhen you make the assert that a place has the best fing veggi burger on the planet and throw your arm up in the air in exclam you better know whi you are talk about 

be that i have been a vegetarian for over 14 year now i have had a lot of veggi burger and i hate to burst your bubbl dalli g this is not the best fing veggi burger on the planet it was tasti i will give you that but onli becaus it was smother with sweet jalapeno sauc pepperjack chees and fresh jalapeno i am not a fan of those garden patti nor my soggi fri 

both time i have been here it was pretti pack the first time on a sunday the servic was horribl and the waitress was quit the snob fortun last night visit was quit a bit better but i think that is becaus our waitress want to give me the busi 

so they have some good special i will give them that the food is okay the servic leav a littl someth to be desir i couldnt figur out which bathroom i was suppos to use and the park is pretti bad but they do have a cool patio with fire pit  

becaus i am nice and the coffe is good this morn i am round up my 25 star to a 3real japanes cuisin  
for all those that think teppan style is authent japanes food i hope my yelp open your eyes
 dont get me wrong i love to eat with a group of friend at kyoto  but know that the teppan style cook is an authent tourist trap creat by a chain restaur owner in japan  

the review

i like the kyoto bowl for but a good japanes food  the chief creat a great experi and atmospher and the sushi is pretti good  i have eaten here a few time and have had a saki bomb here or there i learn the hard way how power full the drink are so use with cautionive been to kyoto a hand of time through the year it an old town scottsdal stapl  whether your look for sushi or hibachi your dine solo or with a group you can find what your look for here but you do have to choos between the sushi side and the hibachi side of the restaurant

 been for both and neither has blown me away but if you dont have extrem high expect this place realli is aok  servic is attent and somewhat quick  price are moder but if your eat sushi it can add up quickly

i do like kyoto as it not your typic old town scene it a bit on the older and more casual side which i like

som highlight from my last meal and keep in mind that im pregnant so i had to go with all cook fish this time
edamame
salad with japanes dressing
futomaki roll
caterpillar roll

whil im not rush back i dont think kyoto is go anywher so i imagin ill be return eventu  rememb it aok as long as you dont have high expect  enjoythis place is a solid good and rather typic mexican restaur  the margarita are good fair price and also come in pitcher the decor is slight tacki when you are seat you get fresh chip and salsa and everybodi seem to be on island time  the one thing that realli doe it for me at frank  lupe old mexico is the patio  that is whi i keep come back  i should also mention i think frank and lupe is a cool name and fun to say  if you are in a hurri dont come here but if you want to loung on the patio and have a leisur lunch with a margarita in old town well then frank and lupe is your placecame here on accid realli becaus the place we want to eat at was longer serv dinner  this place was at 10pm and we were starv  

mi friend and i had the spinach ravioli with pomodoro sauc which was recommend by the waiter  it was just okay  our third friend had the eggplant and mushroom parmagiana with marinara sauc  i like her marinara better than my pomodoro  the entre came with a soup or salad  i had the minestron which was realli delici fresh and not over season  my friend had at the salad which was also veri tasti especi with their hous dress  becaus they had run out of bread the waiter comp us an order of garlic bread which was drench in butter they way we like it  

the price were quit high i thought for pasta but it is a touristi and trendi area  

well without this experi this place would just be anoth place to eat  the owner of the restaur came over to us said he had heard our convers all about the sf giant the reason we were in town and suggest we go to the bar to talk to some gentlemen   i look over and thought what the heck is he talk about   he then brought us over to the bar and introduc us to the father of a cy young award win pitcherwont mention namesand the beat writer of the sf giant  soif you are a basebal fanit not a bad idea to visit this placei have two opinion of this placeit got a lot better as the night went on not sure if it was the drinkswin seem to make everyth better doesnt it we got there realli earli like 800 to get a tabl for our larg group for the even and the place was pack with karaok regular 

when i say regular i mean these are the folk that probabl would tri out for american idol if they werent about 30 year too old for the show serious amaz voic and talent but take it a littl too serious you know the type i actual felt a littl uncomfort and out of place until i final got to sinc my first song our waitress was a total bitch and tri to short chang my friend 10 we hadnt had that mani drink that we wouldnt have notic 10 miss on a 300 beer 

fast forward to about 1030 or 11 mani drink have been had at this point and the regular have thin out crowd is pump sing along danc on stage and have a great time the place is pack with peopl who just want to sing along danc and get a littl crazi  not tri to score a record deal my type of crowd for sure 

moral of the stori if you are a super serious karaok starlet that feel you miss out on your record deal go earli like 5pm and then pleas leav prompli at 10 if you want to go and shake your ass sing along to everi song out there and have a grand old time hit it up after 10 just dont expect to get a seati dont realli feel compel to write to much about this place onli for the fact that i didnt have a terribl horribl time but i didnt have the time of my life either i met up with some fellow yelper which was the high light of the night of cours     but i was my own dd so no drink for me onli lemon water  mmmm so good the bathroom were veri clean but the toilet were so low i was practic sit on the floor and the stall door was so close it was about an inch from my knee uncomfort the last chick at the veri end of the night had the mic last and she couldnt even keep up with the rap song she chose so she appar felt the need to start curs at everyon els to sing it too are you serious it complet lower her from a ladi to a tramp in 2 second i was done i would go again but i would definit reloc by midnighti love karaok  i would not be offend if you call me a karaok whore i sing in the shower i sing at the groceri store i wail in the car i love to sing so when my yelpmat decid to visit the grapevin i was allllllll in

pleas know that the grapevin is a dive and peopl here sing a ton of countri music theyv got a guy who run the karaok and sit in a small booth in the corner of the main bar youll be abl up select from two book one by artist  one by song titl the song select was decent but certain not the best ive ever seen the crowd is on averag in their 40s50s but if your younger it waaay more fun if you go there with your friend the sound in the bar is a bit off balanc but the grapevin offer a fun time

31 yelp challeng 331this place is such a dive that it awesom i was in town with some cowork for a summit and whenev we get togeth someon alway mention karaok look on the yelp app for nearbi bar or place to find such an activ the grapevin was at the top of our list

sur it not a well lit clean or fanci bar in ani way and servic is a bit slow yet friend but the atmospher the clientel and the karaok host  were absolut bad ass the crowd was a mix of peopl abov 50 and peopl around 2530 so everi other song was unfamiliar to half of the bar and everi other song was either terribl in a good way or total awesom 

i had an absolut blast while dive bar and karaok are not typic my style if i find myself back in scottsdal for anoth work function i certain wont turn down a chanc to come back to the grapevin aok in my booki went to pei wei last night for a casual girl night dinner  it was a perfect place for a group of girl to meet becaus of the following

it cheap
it fast casual so each person pay their own bill and then sit down no stress when the bill come as is often the case with groups
ther is plenti to choos from on the menu
for those that are picki or diet they are great about special order sauc on the side etc

that be said pei wei is just averag in my eye never my first choic of place to go but i can alway find someth to eat last night i had the shrimp teriyaki bowl with brown rice  the shrimp tast like it came from the freezer probabl becaus it did but the veggi rice and sauc were all pretti good  i notic they chang the menu a bit sinc my last visit and a new special is a vietnames noodl bowl  pho type dish  the chicken lettuc wrap and edamam are alway safe bet and hope will remain on their menu forever

im sure ill be back to pei wei becaus of the posit factor list abov  the concept is a good one just dont compar it to a high end restaur and enjoy it for what it is

p  shout out to all the girl that came out last night  i had fun see all of you and cant wait for the next onerestaur week make write review complic restaur lower their price dure this 7day period a threecours meal run you 29 per person in order to gain new custom and fill spot dure lesspopular dine time at place like lon or cowboy ciao guest end up get meal that would normal cost 50 or more per person for a mere 29 know that i got a muchmor expens meal at a bit of a discount definit make me want to give lon a higher rate 

at the same time howev my husband and i were discuss that we would have been disappoint with our experi had we paid twice the price and sinc peopl read this review may not have the good fortun of go to lon dure the rw when price are lower than normal im go to have to give the restaur 3 star this is base on the food not be that flavor or impress given the price they normal charg 

we start the meal with absolut martini which were pricey at 12 each and contain vermouth even though we ask for them dri sinc we just like joel l thought that spare rib was a strang starter but both want to tri them we decid to pick a starter off the regular menu we both love duck so we order the salad with the sear duck it wasnt great we like that it had pine nut but found the dress to be overwhelm acid and were disappoint by the four pepperonishap paperthin and blandtast duck piec 

the disappoint continu with the spare rib i love the sweet potato pure that accompani them but found the rib themselv to be a bit dri and not all that flavor the carrot jus was not detect or if it was didnt add much and we were dismay to see that the list for the same rib on the regular menu said that the meat came with ancho chile chocol sauc how sad that the rw version of the rib didnt have the opportun to be dress up in a more flavor sauce

for my entre i order the panroast scallop with the roast pepper spaetzl organ spinach and the corn jus my husband doesnt care for scallop much but i found them to be wellcook and not too metal or gritti as bad scallop can be the side especi the spaetzl were interest and pretti flavor i could definit tast that the spinach was organ i also had a glass of wine with my entre and did appreci the pair list on the rw menu next to each cours which made it easi to quick choos an appropri wine  

mi husband had the openfac shrimp ravioli we both love the concept and again found the veget to be realli fresh and tender howev we didnt tast anyth resembl lobster jus and found the shrimp to be pretti overcook the portion was small which we usual dont mind if the dish is highend and superflavor but that wasnt realli the case here 

in term of dessert the lemon tart was just ok and actual remind me of those lemon bar you make from a box mix but the chocol truffl tort with the mint berri was outstand sinc we werent blown away by ani of the other dish we had tri it was realli nice to end the meal with a delici rich dessert 

i am glad to have had a romant meal in a beauti patio set for onli 29 per person but again we would have been quit disappoint with lon food had we gone and paid regular price for everyth 25 for the shrimp ravioli would have been the most disappoint  that be said i cant reiter how peac and uniqu the patio set is and the servic was certain profession and attent the bus boy did an especi nice job of keep the tabl clean and refil water glass the atmospher and servic may make me want to go back at some point mayb on someon els dime and give lon food anoth tri 

one final note  lon doe take reserv through opentablecom although the email confirm request that we call the restaur direct in order to secur patio seat so i would suggest make direct contact with the restaur if it realli matter to you to sit on the patiowe went for brunch i had realli high expect they werent met 

i also wouldnt say i was too disappoint 

it summer so obvious the patio is not abl to deliv it full potenti servic was low energi dine room was dead

th food was good i had the slider but got to sampl the short rib hash and egg benedict id actual get the benedict if i were to go again 

the highlight was the bartend substitut for a kir royal use hibiscus syrup it tast like rose petal this alon has made me put lon on my happi hour bucket list and i feel fair confid that my expect will be met for that onethe first time i ate here was when my inlaw visit two year ago  i had the teriyaki glaze salmon and found it to be just okay  the garlic mash potato are whip so i didnt realli enjoy that either

aft the food situat at zoobrew was a bust dottsi z and i with our plus one zip over here for dinner on friday even  first off we had excel servic and there was free live soft porn for entertain  stay tune for dottsi reviewsh had the best view of the action  

we start off with the toast ravioli with meat  i didnt think it was great but i would have prefer the chees  my husband had a steak which he said was veri good  i went with the smoke salmon appet for a light dinner  light dinner  there are two word that usual arent next to each other in my vocabulari  with the salmon was warm pita a horseradish mouss and caper  i couldnt detect the horseradish which was fine with me  the plate was a nice combin of flavor  a littl green appl or chees might be a nice addit but i enjoy it

i might have bump frasher to four star had dottsi plus one not found a piec of plastic in his sandwich suppos from the turkey  as it is i still cant say that im a fani waiver between a 25 and a 3 which is a shame becaus we realli like the food but experienc horribl servic 

we call in advanc and was told to come on over but the were told there might not be a tabl becaus of so mani reserv i shot back with a if we had known the person we talk to was not truth about open tabl we would have gone elsewher  the girl made some excus about not work the front and not know the situat was it my sweatshirt that indic we should go elsewher or was there someth els similar to the old coupl who kept stare at us dure dinner that we were unawar of that isnt accept in scottsdal no tabl my ass we were prompt seat onc the hostess came 

irrit level risingdid we make a mistak and should we have gone elsewhere

so strike one 

highlight two drunk men take 6 rose out of the bin hand a seventh to me which i put back and say they had girl to impress 

after the whole seat deal we settl on the follow 
there was no ask if we want appet or beverag like at other tabl she just ask if we were readi to order 

well point of no return

i got the crab stuf dover sole with green chili mac n chees and the acorn squash the bf got the halibut with the acorn squash and the garlic mash potato each entre come with two side of your choice

th halibut was uneven cook so perfect in some part and overcook in other other than that he like his mash and squash the stuf sole was perfect cook and the green chili mac in chees was okay it was creami but not a lot of kick the pasta was also well cook not soft and mushi the acorn squash was like candi it had some walnut cranberri sauc and cinnamon 

the serv are huge but there is littl detail to present the three portion of sole were differ size the panko was slight burn and the portion were not all the way bread if you dont care about stuff like that then awesom if you are a stickler and a firm believ if a place that tri to have a classi atmospher but doesnt it is disappoint you will be irrit 

the gooey golden cake was someth mention on sever review so we order it 

strike two

th waitress gave us the bill san cake right after we order we ask if we did not make ourselv clear when we order she again apolog usual that stuff is compd when there are so mani parti foul we got charg for us no biggiew had alreadi gotten a last impress 

overal the gooey cake i recommend pass it is okay the carmel sauc on it is decent but it is noth memorable

food is 34 star 
servic was a 152 at least at our tabl everyon els seem to be get great servic with a smile perhap next time i should wear my gucci heal and bebe dress 

for our two entre 1 ice tea and the dessert it came out to around 7300 buck 

this is my first fail here in az the review thus far on yelp have steer me rightbecaus the food was overal good in flavor it was not a total losswith 16 checkin to date and the covet duchess titl i guess it time to review this jamba juic location

y it a chain  ill get that out of the way  and if there were an altern local own smoothiejuic establish close to home id drop this place in a heartbeat  but ala there not  

so when im crave some fruiti good and protein this is where i tend to go  i  know it a lot of sugar and it pricey for what it is but sometim a smoothi just hit the spot  

ive had the follow thing from their menu
wheatgrass shots
orang juice
yogurt cups
oatmeal
and pretti much all of the all fruit smoothies
  five fruit frenzy
  mega mango
  peach perfection
  pomegran paradise
  strawberri whirl

th origin medium size smoothi are pretti fill especi onc you add protein  if you go with whey protein it expand so much that you usual get bump up to the next size which is realli larg and sometim is enough for breakfast and a snack later on depend on my appetite

th staff is friend enough and there is typic never a line at this locat when i go  so like i said abov this place is aok for what it is and sinc im too lazi to make my own smoothi at home and there are no amaz local own competitor nearbi it look like ill continu give my smoothi busi to jamba juicive got to hand it to smart  final for provid some incred econom price option for both name brand product and suppli it worth a visit to save some big buck by shop here this is one of my goto stop for parti suppli like plate cup napkin water etc think of smart  final like the dollar store meet costco10710
mi first visit here was mayb 3 or 4 year ago w a friend and wed intend to tri dinner and perhap split a pastri  howev after look over the dessert display case we decid to have a pastri tast parti instead  my fave pastri that day and we had sampl 6 or more mayb 8 differ varieti were the chocolatechip stud cannoli and napoleon  his was of cours his fave italian pastri the sfogliatell  i rememb it have a lemon cream fill and not enough of it  but he was happi with it and that all that matter  

fastforward to last month i decid to tri their stuf shell 9 which came w 5 shell a side salad and garlic bread  salad was your basic salad w oliv and a pepperoncini but i like the generous portion and how fresh and crisp it felt and tast  the foilwrap garlic bread was noth to rave about i didnt even bother to take a pictur of it after i had a bite  the jumbo shell were veri good love the ricotta fill and the melti chees on top  howev had i known that the dish came w marinara sauc id have request it be omit  not that it didnt tast great it did if not a bit too salti but i do better w creambas rather than tomatobas sauces

c wait to tri more from the menu

had great pic to add here but for some reason the add photo link was miss102710

had i not have to wait 20 minut for two sandwich id easili give this meal 4 star  look over these photo and rememb how good these sandwich tast id like to visit again soon but recal how long my wait was and the negat vibe that bounc off the cook that took my order and anoth whom i thought was either an owner or a manag i am veri hesit on return    i did enjoy the sandwich especi the cheesesteak even though halfway through my halfsandwich i decid it was a littl too salti  i thought the marinara on the parm a great contrast to the rich creami of the cheesesteak and kept me reach for anoth bite of the eggplant  love munch on the hefti wheat roll but i didnt care much for the soft white roll that the parm rest onreview 600   yes  hooray for me

i swear i have eaten here befor but not in age  i came here last night becaus i was on this side of town and it brought back a few memori of year past when i first move here

for starter this place is cute and has a lot go for them  set up as part groceri part restaur it in a strip mall on scottsdal road near thoma  hour are great and menu is larg with great price  i love a good menu you can basic get just about anyth you want done your way here and the food is pretti good

for starter the wait was a bit longer then i had anticip and i thought it would have move a lot quicker consid i was here at 830 on a wednesday night there was hard anyon in here  i thought it was just an off night but after read other review i guess their a littl slow on servic  i dont mean to sound impati but the wait did seem long and i was quit hungry

second the groceri store was well stock but some of the shelv seem a bit tire i was sit there wait for my food and notic that some of the shelv with heavier can on them were start to buckl and warp  mayb it time to upgrad  noth is perfect but it kind of made me feel tire after i sat there stare off at random thing in the place while wait for my food

on a more posit note the food is delici  you can get anyth you want made up ani way you like  i went with a half tuna sandwich and i couldnt finish the darn thing  great awesom price with a larg menu and a great concept here

also while i was here wait i overheard a custom talk with one of the staff member i guess guy fieri stop in here recent for diner drive in and dive  i also saw a huge poster of him on the wall by the custom pick up area  10000 bonus point for that

overal place is great but i feel like they need to move a littl quicker in the back with food prepar and work on step up some of the groceri shelv to make it look less tire  great product select not onli in the groceri area but menu as well  definit worthwhil just dont expect your food to quick and be prepar to wait a bitreceiv a coupon in the mail for a bogo beef  cheddar sandwichso i drop by this locat to grab a bite  i was starv when i arriv so i overord  in addit to my 2 beef  cheddar i order a roast chicken club sandwich and a cur friesdamn there goe the diet

httpwwwyelpcombizphotosx0y6tu03x7zojzkciekkqselectmnss2qguli0wf2mfyc5pyq

th beef  cheddar were ok  the roast chicken club was veri good  of cours their cur fri are one of their signatur itemsand was solid

th kid work at this place were veri friend and were work hard to  keep the restaur clean i could hear them in the back talk about how to proper mop the floor and wipe down the tablessometim the current generat get it right

return factor  75a friend of mine and i decid to stop in for some take out it was a friday night and man was this place jump lot of coupl were danc it up and listen to the elvi imperson too funni but everyon realli seem to be enjoy themselv and have a good time georg was out and about talk to everyon and his custom seem to be regular as everyon realli seem to know everyon in this place 

anywho my friend and i had decid that we were go to order what is is call the anni special in which you get a soup two appet and two entre plus all the entre come with veget fri rice we had ask if we could pay extra and have the hous fri rice instead of the veget and we were told emphat no substitut i was like ok we had no problem pay extra it wasnt that serious my friend could tell i was piss due to the look on my face i was like wow realli did that just happen 

anyway we order shrimp with honey glaze walnut hous fri rice and kung pao 3 sea let me just say that the food was veri good i mean veri veri good the hous fri rice had ton of shrimp chicken and pork the shrimp with honey glaze walnut were divin and the kung pao 3 sea was nice and spici with ton of scallop shrimp and fish so whi onli three star when someon say no substitut the way that this person did it kinda leav a bad tast in your mouth will i drive all the way back out here again mayb but i know now to never ever ever ever ask to switch out one item for anoth and even offer to pay extra becaus it will not happenitd been year sinc id been to a rubi tuesday befor last month and sinc then ive been three or four time is it that good no not realli i mean it not bad not as bad you probabl think it is anyway but it aint great so whi do i keep go back that a good question becaus it not cheap either probabl becaus it close to work

iv been make my way through their seafood option late the jumbo lump crab burger  it crab cake on a bun that probabl some kind of nono on somebodi locarb diet fri shrimp grill creol shrimp shrimp scampi tri em all and theyr all the same  not that good but not bad an incred solid three stars

oh and theyv got a veggi burger which technic push them up to 35 star but im not in the round up kind of mood todayafter stop in at la bocca and z teja for a drink and appet my husband sister who was in town for the weekend and i decid to stop at ra for a few sushi dish and drink we sat at a high tabl in the bar area our server was friend enough at first although as ill explain below she turn out to be realli rude and unprofession the music was definit loud but i do think that the atmospher here is great if your in the mood to be out and about and around a lot of peopl i wouldnt choos it for a romant conversationfocus outing but it not a bad place to take an outoftown guest for a night out or to have an energet night with friend 

sinc i was drive i just had water my husband and my sister order 2 of the specialti cocktail which came quick enough but were ridicul sweet and weak if you like drink with some substanc to them id suggest order a regular mix drink and not one of their specialti drink even if the cheesi name like effen it in the raw call out to you for food we order the lobster spring roll crispi spici tuna roll and the yellowtail sashimi the fish was definit fresh but the portion were ridicul small the lobster spring roll were actual realli good and you get a decent amount of lobster meat for the price 975 

we were plan to go to final round a bar in south temp that has karaok on friday and saturday after so we were think about leav after we finish our appet but my sister was still hungri so we ask our server if we could take anoth look at the menu she brought us the menu but we quick realiz that we were full so we told her that we were readi for the check she all of a sudden got an attitud and just snatch the menu and walk away we were sit in the bar area precis becaus we werent plan on order a lot and we didnt appreci her attitud 

we paid and left but my sister then realiz that she might have left her debit card in the check present when she went back to look the hostess was realli ditzi and rude about it and didnt even offer proactiv to talk to our server about the card my sister had to ask her if she could go find our server to help us when my sister ask our server if she had seen it she was realli rude and snap that she hadnt seen it my sister ask nice if the server could take a look in the check present and instead of be help and kind in a situat that was obvious stress she stomp over grab the check present with our check copi insid and shook it out state see it not here i understand that a restaur like ra is busi on a friday night but that didnt excus rude or snappi servic with an attitud especi when it came to someth serious 

decent sushi and appet and fun atmospher weigh in ras favor small portion sicken sweet drink and fullofit servic send it rate right back down to 3 stardear four peaks

it so hard in today generic corpor driven societi to find a place that take pride in their product like you do brew eight varieti of beer on a regular basi and creat new and excit season brew with the tender love intimaci that onli a small busi can provid you deserv an incred amount of credit for that 

mi question for you is do they all have to tast assy

i mean i know some peopl like the tast of your arizona peach ale but the last time i tri it i did someth uncharacterist i didnt even finish the whole thing it smell like countri time heaven but it tast like fetid peach bile your ipa hop knot and oatmeal stout give me bitter beer face but sinc theyr suppos to have strong charact and flavor i accept this inevit and leav them to someon who will love them with all the passion they deserv and it seem like your kiltlift exist onli to get me plow in record time at about 6 alcohol by volum so that a good thing and mean it bound to be strong like a bull so i can accept the ass factor 

when it boil down to it the onli beer you have on tap that seem fit for my consumpt are the 8th street ale and the hefewiezen but even those leav me with a hang over the next morn 

did i do someth wrong is that whi you dont like me is that whi you feel it necessari to have your beer drill it way into my skull and leav me with a headach the morn after regardless of the fact that the fanci import and run of the mill domest beer i consum at other bar dont even caus me to blink an eye i thought we had a pretti solid relationship but sinc i havent been visit you that often i guess youv had a chang of heart

so ill make a concert effort to swing by for happi hour everi now and then to share a pitcher between 3 and 7 but onli when somebodi els suggest we visit you just seem to slip through the crack whenev my littl barfli mind start think up fun place to enjoy a coupl brew after work luckili that isnt the case when my grumbl stomach doe the talk becaus your food is delici and would be a terribl thing to miss out on

i think it may also have someth to do with your patio which is unwelcom and a freakin madhous at all time of the day provid i can get one those gigant squar tabl onli let me chat with the peopl to either side of me and im practic sit in the lap of the peopl behind me caus me to maneuv like a slinki snake just to get out of my chair and weasel my way to the restroom doesnt this piss off your server becaus id be piss off if my job was to pick my way through that maze on a regular basi mayb that whi sometim i get poor servic on the patio becaus your indoor and side car dine area have alway had the most attent ladi wait on me i guess i have a serious love hate thing go on with your patio peaks

grant the food you offer is phenomen especi for a place that call itself a breweri you have gone abov and beyond the basic need for chex mix and peanut on the bar or fri greasi food that on par with bowl alley eat you offer some amaz and delici dish 

one of my favorit is your southwest burger with pepper jack chees and green chili that is posit rockin with flavor but the sweet jalapeno dress tast a littl meh so i get it on the side when im a littl iffi about the funk factor of my burger 

you do have one stand out menu item that everyon should bow down to though and that is the grill chicken beer bread it is a soft pillowi tribut to chicken everywher if they could speakwel theyd berat you for eat them so well consid it a posthum tribut or perhap it a tribut to the amaz artichok and pepper and the sauc drizzl in this dish is the perfect accompaniment

also your beer batter fri are off the hook good

so at least youv got that go for you 

ill be see you around peak i just wont be sing your prais on a regular basis

cheers
ericathe silver mine sub tucson locat got me through colleg at u of a especi thank to their late hour and deliveri sinc those day ive had this silver mine sub in temp a coupl time and to sum it up they provid a decent sandwich that hit the spot but doesnt make me want to necessarili write home about it it just a decent sub that especi good if your in a huge hurri your kind of broke or your hungri after the bar and need some food to eat on the cab ride home i like that this locat has a killer honey mustard they serv with their sandwich the bread is sofi and chewi and they offer a wide varieti of topz teja exist for one reason and one reason alon to sell awesom margarita at not so awesom price that youll total shell out for anyway becaus their massiv strength will sucker punch you with the first sip and then bat you around like an orca play with a babi seal right befor go in for the kill

seriously

thre of these thing will have you giggl slur declar of love to the member of your parti believ your sexi status just gain 2 crave jack in the box taco and possibl break a heel upon your exit

they are a thing of beauti and the reason whi they enforc a three margarita limit

unfortun theyll run you 6 to 9 buck depend on how much razzl dazzl your go for the sixth street margarita is the most basic frozen or on the rock and is delici so is the z top shelf and the chambord and the frozen watermelon and the grand marnier and i think your sens the trend here

and the food well it exist so you dont leav in the condit discuss abov it not as good as the margarita but onc you have a coupl your realli not go to care that much

brunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulg in a three dollar mimosa their three dollar top shelf doityourself bloodi mari bar with all the fixin includ beef jerki stir stick or the epic margarita the chicken and potato hash is decent but it use to be much better back when it was the savori sage chicken and potato hash and had how do you say actual flavor now it just blah by comparison well done blah but blah all the same although mr man love it so you may want to hit up the smother burrito or jerk chicken salad instead both of which are delici 

happi hour is also a pretti good deal with one dollar off all drink and half price appet id recommend the cast iron skillet dumpl that are like crispi round asian pot sticker that come out sizzlin in sweet chile sauc or the tortilla soup which is done realli realli well here with avocado and lot of chunki chicken 

but forget the food it the backup vocal to the wail showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that run back stage for a mid show sexdrugbooz bing while his second tier standin entertain the crowd with a limp solo 

the margarita are bad ass and they know it let em get a littl sauci with ya 

oh and the patio rock almost as hard as the margarita so make sure to be seat out thereive been back to this pita jungl quit a few time servic has gotten consider better and for that im thank howev they still fail when it come to put out consist food i dont understand whi this keep happen it unfortun becaus pita jungl is so good when it consist and i realli want to go here all the time but when food come out differ everi time i cant spend my money here

i thought i had a good thing go when i went on a friday and saturday even the servic was excel  the food was total fantast  5 star ala these experi trick me into believ they had improv so i came back on a weekday dure a non peak time i order the same thing i did over the weekend a chicken shwarma wrap this time it was perfect too i thought to myself thank god now i can start come back here regular so i came back on anoth weekday same time and the chicken shwarma was all wrong 

here what was wrong

not enough lettuce
not enough vegetables
not enough garlic sauce
not enough tahini

th wrap was this littl measli thing with about half the amount of dress and veggi as when i got it the last few time wtf i serious thought i was go crazi so i came back the follow week and order the same thing think mayb it was just an off day nope the same thing happen except this time it has even less tahini and sauc 

serious these shwarma dont tast half as good without a fair amount of garlic sauc and tahini when i got it the first few time everi bite had sauc this time i could bare even tast it so at this point i ask my waiter for extra sauc and when i got the bill i found out he charg me the thing that suck is i didnt look at the receipt until after he swipe my card otherwis i would have mention it

i guess i should have complain to him straight up that the pita wrap tast like crap then mayb he wouldnt have charg me it was still realli annoy both those thing were 075 each i was not happy

im give this place an extra star becaus the server have final becom attent and now i know never to come on a weekday and onli on the weekendguss pizza is a place i revisit everi few month for a reason i cant entir define

their pizza isnt terribl at all  i dont think it gross or anyth  it is bland  i order a few pizza from guss that sort of like sort of like bite into pizzalik food with pizza essenc  the flavor was just weak for some reason  it was like and i know it not physic possibl but it tast like they water it down somehow  it the onli way it make sense

i have been surpris a few time and have had a pizza that was standout good

th to appreci  it cheaper than most place  sinc this place is open 24 hour you can pop in at all odd hour of the night and get a bite to eat with a few buddi  split the bill a few way and your realli onli out a coupl buck each  also it seem like the perfect place to hide after do a mob hit

th first time i ate there i was so drunk i didnt even know what the fuck  it was my 21st birthday  i was a littl uh i was out of control  ive been back quit a few time sinc then most of which i have done in a sober state so hope when they see me they dont think oh great here drinky

on night i felt super antisoci  i didnt want to go out  i just felt like kickin it  i spent the night with my dog and i order pizza then fell asleep watch teenag mutant ninja turtlesth first movi  that was a particular good pizza  when i was like 5 year old when i realli would have enjoy do that i never had a chanc becaus my parent would be like do you know how expens pizza is  well yes i do and it total worth it  

be an adult kick assone time i was drunk and order one of their ginorm pizza with jalapeno i had it deliv to me in the park lot of a frat hous the deliveri dude gave me the amount and i thought it was ridicul i think it was 18 or someth which in hindsight isnt that ridicul but i had been drink free keg beer all night plus i think i got at least one free roofi so i just thought i would go along with the free theme of the even the deliveri driver call his boss for me and put me on the phone with him the boss said i sound hot so he wouldnt charg me so i got a free pizza the pizza was okay750 for a margarita with the whole shaker  pretti sweet deal  not the best margarita in the world but it was cheap

oth than that the bar is weird with the short chair and the chip are alright  i wouldnt stop in here for food or drink for that matter  but when your on campus and need a marg within walk distanc after be bore to tear by your professor this place will do031810

thank you for listenwhile in the phoenix area on busi i was in the mood for vietnames cuisin  yelp point me toward this restaurant

loc close to arizona state univers  the place is clean and they serv chines food as well i onli order the spring roll refer as summer roll in other place and the larg bowl of beef pho or as they call it the 1 super everything

port size are huge i had a lot of pho in my bowl my onli problem was the the tast of the broth was veri bland the broth was a littl underseaon for my taste

th spring roll were a bit of a disappoint  the seam or edg where they met when they close the roll was hard i shouldnt hear the crunch come from the spring roll skin while bite down

overal not a terribl place if your hungri and want to stuff yourself with food in this regard this place will not disappoint  if your look for more tast and flavor  you might want to look elsewher 

i will need to tri the other dish when im back next time mayb then i can give them a better ratesinc the dd remodel ive been to sever locat and overal ive been pleasant surpris  servic is usual friend and my turkey sausag egg white flatbread sandwich is consist pretti good

so as i pass by this locat today i figur id have a similar experi to the other ive been to but the employe at this locat were slow unfriend and just not welcoming

mi turkey sausag egg white flatbread was still consist with the other though so i cant complain too much

y i hate chain but everi now and then i allow myself a visit to dd  i can put up with a littl attitud at a chain if i have to it worth it for the tasti coffe tea sandwich and occasion sweet treat  especi for the price  for everyth els i shop localok it been a while sinc i had a fast food burger but it was move day for my love daughter whitney yesterday
th menu select for move day lunch is bag of burger for the move crew of which i was a part
if you are go to do chain drive through burger you can do far wors than whataburg i mean you micki and you too burger king
i like the fact that whataburg toast the bun and smear on a littl butter flavoredsometh greas oil lardi have no idea but it add to the tast and doesnt make me ill so thumb up they dont get the order wrong ani more often than ani other drive through place and when they do they have remad the order without attitud so that nice
ov the year i have tri a coupl of other thing on their menu and they do a pretti good job with a chicken sandwich and sausag biscuit from their breakfast menu again far superior to some of their nation competitors
good for the move day bag of burger but i wouldnt go out of my way to get there btw when is lucki boy go to put a place in old town scottsdal       weekday lunch buffet       


mike c  i drop in here for the lunch buffet  it a midsiz place seat about 60 in a dine room that a littl odd copper ceil but pretti nice  i would have appreci a booth but there were tabl onli a bit of a minus  next go to wash up turn up no paper towel in the bathroom but instead one of those blower that chap your hand with warm air until you give up  wipe them on your shirt or pant  you know the machin that say it save tree  uh arent tree a renew resourc that are grown specif to make paper towel   isnt most electr generat with nonrenew fuel  sorri i digress  so i use my bare hand to pull the door open replac more germ than i had just remov by wash  went to the serv area

next they were realli short on food here ala mike kwan infam golden coin  there was no salad  almost no dessert so it 1star  were out of here like at that aw wander hors cafe place yesterday right

wel not so fast  for one thing at the head of the serv line there were various size of plate sit there includ extra larg  what a love gestur to have those big plate out whisper have all the food you want were realli glad your here  that the messag i got anyway  i start warm up to the place  then the hot food select was adequ  not too soupi as it is at some indian buffet  for the lentil which are suppos to be soupi they had some nice littl bowl out

al the food was good plus the hostesscashierown  was sweet  veri appreci of our busi  sad it realli hurt for custom  we were the onli one there right at 12 to 1230

lunch buffet is 1130 to 3 pm  onli 6 includ a soft drink veri inexpens for an indian buffet  pleas tri it they need you  it aok

12109 updat  yeah yelp hq  the name of this place was such a mess in the header that it didnt even come up in search  they have now fix itstop 1 for the light rail pub crawl was rula bula at least for me  and it was my first time there

i was with my motherinlawtob joan m and upon make our way to the back patio we were welcom by a huge group of yelper  great back patio by the way  i had a stella and joan an irish coffee

k was our server and handl our group well  she did a good job consid so mani peep arriv at differ time and pay separ  onli one discrep that i overheard but it wasnt too big a deal

th bathroom was pretti filthi and the tp was out in one stall while the door wouldnt shut on anoth  not a fan of nasti bathroom in restaurants

enjoy pub atmospher and conveni locat on mill ave just off the light rail  although we didnt eat dure our visit i was impress with the select on the menu and base on the posit review that came befor mine i would total be open to return to eat sometim  ill updat thenumm yea there is noth all that great about the rula

i was here with my bff yea like a teenag girl lol caus we was bore and figur get out of the spot

w took the train up to mill alreadi half toast on a coupl can of micki in thirstbust cup care of circl k heart circl k kay ya know

anyway so walk up and down mill scof at the peopl look to get fuck up i blew up amyd on the cell say we would catch up with her at the set or yucca tap room

end up walk back to the rula and grab a coupl drink umm yea this place isnt realli great or anyth  just kinda like all the rest of the bar on mill just irish styliz ive been here plenti of time befor and never thought to myselfwow what a great irish bar meh it kinda like a theme colleg bar and noth more oh well grab a coupl blue moon and bizounc threw a middl finger to mill as we jump on the trolli and bust ass back to phx scream 602sinc everyday is a good day for a guin and sinc i happen to be on mill everi singl day this is the spot i like to come to collabor those 2 fact of life i also realli love that i get free drink often but i think it just the red hair serious red head in irish pub i could tell stori for days

it not exact your model irish pub but they have a decent happi hour yummi menu option lot of space and a sweet patio with an outdoor bar the onli real downfal here is the douchey dude that are alway here and that it is alway retard pack after 8pm otherwis it all good serious subtract that and add a mechan bull or someth equal obnoxi and im a fan for lifedont tell my husband im give rula bula 3 star  he think it deserv 4  but he should tri earn his littl elit badg and write his own review i say

aft zoolight fell through on saturday night not interest in walk from a park lot in chandler to get there we found ourselv on mill which is actual onli the 2nd time ive ever been on mill  my husband on the other hand had too mani month unsupervis in the valley befor i join him and has appar visit mani of these fine establish includ rula bula

not be a huge fan of irish food or beer for that matter i decid this would be the 1 in 100 dine experi i let him choos  i love  the interior i must say  and the menu is not so bad either  if i could find quesadilla and hot wing in ireland i might just visit  but so as to not complet humili my husband i order a cider rather than a margarita and fish n chip  the cider was perfect not too sweet  if onli beer should tast this good

th fish cod was perfect cook and the batter was flavor  i just wish it was a littl more crispi  perhap it didnt hold up to my splash of vinegar  the chip were near perfect except i wish the fish hadnt been plop on top as it caus them to lose their crispi too

i would be happi to come back to rula bula again  they have a great patio with a bar out there as well  but i think ill stick to the time of year when asu is not in session  i have a sneak suspicion this place is a differ beast when school start back upive been anxious await to tri this place for months

il start with the good

im not a vegan by ani stretch and i thought the food was phenomen i order the singapor orang bowl with mock chicken and noodlesjust wonder season well fresh veggi and the mock chicken was a veri pleasant surpris i was expect it to tast and feel fake but the tast and textur was just like chicken 

mi friend order the mac and i swear it tast exact like a big mac from mcdonald the thyme fri are delish as well

to top it off i had a cooki dough tsoynamiomgamaz like a blizzard that tast and had the textur similar to mochi i love it

so clear the food is not the issu i will come back despit the problem im about to list becaus the food is so good

th bad

i was not happi with the servic i receiv not warm or friend at all i dont appreci that smug hipster attitud sorri and they dont serv a hot chai latt that was annoy so i settl for tea and they forgot to give me my hot water and then act annoy when i ask for it

mi tea cup was dirti it had lipstick on it hello we are in the middl of a flu outbreak right now not happi about that 

it is expens 5 for some ice cream the tsoynami you will not get your money worth here

not mani option if you cant have soy it is in practic everything

th food gave me horribl gas sorri tmi not the fault of the place but just be awar if your not use to vegan food mayb it was the mock chicken andor tsoynami becaus i eat veggi all the timekind of end up here by accid  one of those im hungri there a restaur kind of moment  and sinc i think to myself everi time i drive by hmm i wonder if that is ani good it was worth a shot

th interior of the restaur is nice enough though outdat by scottsdal standard  but that actual a plus for me sometim   our server was excel  the right balanc of attent without be intrusive

a far as the food it was good but not over the top good for me  i alway go with a pasta dish on a first visit and it was manicotti this time  the red sauc was flavor with a littl sweet  and i guess that about all i can say about manicotti  appet salad and dessert were all okay but appar not spectacular as im at a loss for word here  perhap i should not have wait so long to review

i realli did enjoy our dinner here  it was quiet and without the drama that cher t had to endur  i am sure we will come backrosita is pretti averag i probabl stop in onc a year i stop in the other week on the way to gammag to catch 9 to 5 

there is noth outstand about this place but noth to terribl either 

the chip and salsa are alway good and plenti but they are just ship and salsa it hard to mess them up 

i alway get the same thing a green corn tamal and a shred beef taco i like them 

the servic is hit and miss last week was horrend our waitress was no where to be found never check on us to see if the food was ok or if we need anyth and we wait for ever to get the bill and had to flag her down to have her take our payment 

when i go here i dont ever have high expect so i am general not let downi can understand whi this restaur is a hit with the asu crowd it proxim to campus access by light rail low price the hummus appet alon a generous serv at less than 3 buck with hot pita halv could be a heavi snack or a light meal the veri inexpens sandwich vari in qualiti i found the falafel to be realli good the koubideh was ok and the beef shawarma was dri and lack in flavor the tabouleh was a bit too acid for my tast and would probabl have been better if more bulgur were ad  wait time at dinner depend on the size of your group when i came with a larger group we had a long wait but seat was prompt when i came with just 2 friend overal my dine experi here were ok for food qualiti i consid the nearbi cafe istanbul to be a better choic but for price this is the place to goive been to hajibaba a coupl of time now and i must say my visit have not been met with consist in the qualiti of their food  

hajibaba is super popular as you can see by the yelp review of this place  the main reason for their popular i think is due to their price  their price are almost ridicul low for the portion size you get when compar to other mediterranean  greek type of restaur 
    
i did find someth i like at hajibaba i recommend you tri their gyro  it a realli good gyro and is one of the best in the phoenix metro  they dont shave their gyro meat like at the other place  they cut their gyro meat off in long chunk differ size  this add anoth level of delici when compar to gyro at other locat  

they over stuff their gyro with meat a small amount of tomato red onion and pickl wild cucumb with some tzatziki sauc  the pickl wild cucumb were unexpect and a nice chang from other plaec that serv gyro  my gyro need a bit more tzatziki but my server was slam and forgot it oh well

a for everyth els on their menu  meh ive had better  their dolmad rice and kibbe all tast old and over cook  the shawarma and falafel also tast over cook and were veri dri for my like  

restaur locat and condit 2 to 3 stars
servic  3 stars
food  2 to 3 star except for the gyro which are 45 stars
pric  5 plus stars

im look forward to go back for anoth gyro and mayb ill tri their hummus andor a greek salad on my next  hope to see you theremeh this place is just alright i came here with a bunch of cowork for lunch last week and wasnt veri impress i got the hummus which was pretti good and the lunch special which consist of a beef gyro and greek salad it was decent but i wasnt floor with the qualiti of food the price was perfect though a good deal for the amount of food they pile on the plate i will give them a star for the sheer fact that the cup they serv their drink in are enorm i dont think anyon need a refil the passion fruit tea is tasti the waitress are realli friend and the atmospher isnt complet terribl it just the food that was the debbi downer kind of like this snorefest of a reviewmy travel companion had me psych for some steak the moment we land in phoenix i was super set to chow down and then he rememb some greek restaur that he onc went to here that blew him away and this is how i end up here one thursday evening

i check the yelp app and after share that it was a solid three star i was told those yelper dont know greek food ah ok let see

wel phoenix yelper you did not let me down mbfgr is a solid three star the hummus was ok ive had better home made over the last few year the chicken and beef skewer were tasti but there wasnt a secret sauc that blew me away and the veggi they serv with them were standard  cut carrot broccoli and zucchini 

or mayb i dont know greek foodthe whole reason i move to phoenix was for a job  yes i got a job here in phoenix and move here just for that  california was show no sign of ever open up the job market soon so i did what i had to do  so far im realli like it and find some cool new place to go and great place to eat  macaya is one of those discoveri  

after spend two week with a group of peopl in a train class some of us decid to go out and celebr with lunch on good friday which was a half day for us  the compani was great and i found the place veri easili so that was a plus too  i thought the open patio was awesom and i can see this place hoppin on a friday or saturday night  even at lunch they had 2 beer  

the servic was a littl slow the chip and salsa were ok and my enchilada were pretti good not great but good  honest i think it the atmospher that got me though  they had this big outdoor bar and lot of space on the patio lot of tabl and chair  i love the outdoor waterfal too  so in my opinion the food is a 2 and im give it anoth start for the atmospher  if you dont expect much when you go youll be fine  if cleanli is next to godli and you see me here in the afterlif youll know you didnt make it  this place was a mess  not filthi as in never been clean just a mess as in what kind of peopl have been eat here tonight  

there a restaur i love in flagstaff call la fonda  so now ill eat anywher that share the name even if not the food  this la fonda i cant say i love but i did like it

th chip were hot and obvious made inhous given the nice coat of greas at the bottom of the bowl  they serv two salsa a mild chunki one and a hotter chipotl one  both were veri good  i just pretend i hadnt read the review about the reus salsa  i had a red chile chimichanga  the red chile was excel  a littl hot but veri flavor and the meat was welltrim and devoid of excess fat and other noned part  the tortilla are better than some of the place here but not on par with carolina of course

our server was genuin nice  this and the rundown interior are a clue youv cross the scottsdal border  good enough i may come back sometim6111

i final made it to hot for happi hour  park is in the back be care park anywher els as your car might get tow  there are mister for those who like eat outsid  sinc ive onli been here onc and i had to eat at the bar area for happi hour i dont know what the nois level is indoor but it certain seem nice in there if not a bit cramp  a big minus for me is that smoke is allow outsid so im hope to secur a tabl indoor on my next visit

ord the onli cocktail on the menu that use ginger liqueur sorri but i forgot the name and realli like it  it tast light and refresh but pack quit a punch so be care it went down veri smooth and veri fast  happi hour knock off onli 1 down to 9 so i suppos it good that the bartend had a heavi hand    as for my entre i had the roast poblano artichok and spinach dip which came w both crostini and water cracker  skip the water cracker they felt stale when i bit into them and theyr veri bland and stick w the crispi nicelytoast and oliv oildrizzl crostini  i did and i ate the entir thing  well minus the water cracker  the base was veri creami yet also chunki i love food that layer on mani textur and i realli appreci the heat that the roast poblano brought to this dish  from the moment i took that first bite i thought that  this dish was differ from ani other spinach and artichok dip ive ever tri  tri it if your into sa dip and let me know what you think of this one

th rest of the menu sound great but can get veri pricey salad and soup 610 starter 1019 and entre 2032  will tri to return for lunchi came here over the holiday weekend for a sub  i want to check this place out and see what it all about it look cool as heck from the outsideposs a former mcdonald  2 stori with a big window front

anyway i cruis in and studi the menu  i end up get a hot pastrami sub which was delici by the way  i think it was about 8 inch long and the price were fair and reason  hooray for a good deal  the place was quiet when i was there  there was onli 1 custom eat alon and myself  they also have happi hour special here with a few beer to go with your sub n stuff  pretti neat

i think the sub here are decent but the place realli need a faceliftuntil recent the onli time i went to dos gringo trailer park was to partak in the belov asu tradit of drink 50 cent corona until i can no longer walk at which point i begin yell at random stranger head to the bar that if they get me this time ill get them next time cmon it just 50 cent corona light pleas 

howev after graduat i regret had to get one of those thing that tend to sever limit my mid week drink bing you knowa job it just not as fun to get hammer when you know your run the risk of be abov the legal bac on the way to work in the morn at 8 am oh ive seen it happen 

so now ive been more of a happi hour weekend day drink dos gringo custom and let me tell you it much more enjoy to drink beer even if they do cost more than a dollar in an actual chaira barstool even it also nice to not have to watch where you walk all the time as to avoid the puddl of vomit on the ground and you dont have to worri about those annoy drunk girl who scream at you to get them this time cuz the corona are onli 50 cent i mean geez im not made of quarter over here

a far as drink and food special go dos gringo is pretti solid and im surpris theyr not busier for friday happi hour it imposs to sit down at most bar in the area at that time but there alway a few barstool and tabl open over there last time my boyfriend and i wander in at about 650 plan to get a coupl happi hour drink but were fine obvious with pay full price for the rest our awesom bartend basic save us 10 buck by throw 6 beer in a bucket of ice for us all 6 at the 2 price and then make sure she came around quick enough for us to put in some taco befor they went up to full price as well we got 6 beer and 8 taco for less than 20 buck it was glorious 

id recommend go for the cheap drink and the great patio just stay away from thursday night if you dont want vomit on your shoecaff boa is a hidden gem on mill avenu for both eat drink and relax with friend it a littl bit on the pricey side though so take advantag of the happi hour and halfpric sangria sundays

it use to be a tini homey littl cafe next to long wong at 7th street and mill and has sinc been convert into a spacious classi wineri and italian bistro at 4th street and mill

happi hour special are onli extend to the bar area which is tini in comparison to the rest of the area there the tradit happi hour from 5 to 7 and a revers happi hour that begin after 10 pm check which day this is avail though becaus im not sure it daili draft beer like guiness and harp are two buck wine by the glass is half off 3 to 6 buck after the discount as are their fanci pant cocktail general 5 bucksth espresso martini is decadentand all appet asid from the huge chees plate are half price one wonki thing about the tab for happi hour is that they take the discount off at the end so just keep a run tab in your head of how much you owe if your with a group to make thing go a littl smoother

im in lust with the shrimp adriatico which is an appet that has five big tiger shrimp swim in garlic tomato sauc that serv with a loaf of bread for dip it fill enough to serv as an entir meal or to share among friends

on sunday pitcher of sangria are half price 15 instead of 30 and are a refresh way to relax with a group of friend in the afternoon i prefer the white wine over the red becaus it compliment the fresh slice appl and muddl citrus make sure to ask them to go easi on the cinnamon though or you may end up with an overpow flavor and chalki texture

dinn is alway divin as well but a littl bit on the pricey side the meal are huge though so your pretti much guarante leftov or you can split an entr with anoth person for an extra 3 buck charg the voodoo penn is a delici cajun flavor dish luca meatbal are savori and fill and the pola pola is some awesom artichok ravioli everyth is done well and i rare encount problem with the server or bartenders

it a nice mellow break from the hubbub of mill avenue

update
 been a littl peev late at the happi hour sinc it onli extend to the bar and the bar is so damn tini now i understand that if i dont get there around 5 i have no chanc of get a seat that fine but the damn chase employe get there around 430 befor happi hour even start where the logic in that and hog all the damn seat leav me with noth but shatter hope and an empti glass you better shape up caff boa or im dock a star
update
youv been dock a star boa you went and increas the price of your entre by three buck at the veri least fuck you and your scrumtious mouth water 19 dollar spaghetti and meatbal theyr fuck meatbal boa plus your half price on glass of wine less than 10 buck is a pretti useless deal now jeezi creezy

thi isnt goodby though ill still chill with you on sunday for the sangria but i shall never indulg in the pola pola voodoo penn or your shitti willow bakeri bread again bastardi rememb when cafe boa was afford the agnolotti boa was 1295 half that for their panini imagin my shock to learn my favorit dish is now 1795 for mushroom fill pasta realli they do have a great wine list but it too is on the high price side and their tast are a pretenti 100 cover  get real
mi last experi deserv 1  but i give 2 s becaus the food is still great i went alon and sat at a tabl for about 15 minut befor i could get eye contact let alon a glass of water  my meal and a glass of wine was an outrag 34  for lunch 
dont get me wrong the food is good but the servic general suck i recommend go on sunday when app and sangria are half off there are just too mani great authent place to go to put up with the price and lack of creativ in their dish120309
decid id go to cb to find out onc and for all what roast veal marrow tast like after hear a coupl of food network celebr chef hark on and on about how wonder they are ann burrel in particular spoke of it on an episod of the best thing i ever ate  id have to say that i didnt think much of them  the present was beauti i must admit but pay 10 for what amount to about a teaspoon and a half ok for argument sake let round it off to two teaspoon of frothi fat accent with hawaiian sea salt and tawni port reduct did not translat to a great experi for me tast nutrit or cost  sure there were a bit of bitter green and three toast piec of bread which two teaspoon of fat could not even cover but i found more joy and susten w the singular toast slice slather w goat chees forgiv me it been awhil sinc i had this app but the spread couldv been mascarpon and ricotta but i want to say goat chees and slice of campari tomato  happi hour price for this app was 450 which i found easier to swallow pardon the pun than to pay 9 for a singular slice of toast w a softchees spread and a littl bitter green on top  i cant eat tomato so those gourmet slice just end up in the garbag bin  it was veri tasti howev so i may order it again but i wont be veri happi about it  perhap i could get a substitut for the tomato  i will ask next time i go35 star 
i see the potenti in caff boa i can see that theyv recent chang the menu and the chef and are make stride toward becom a fantast restaur they just arent there quit yet in my opinion 

mi first visit to the new caff boa was the first week the new chef peyton curri former of digestif fame got start i walk in to secur a tabl and was ask for my first and last nameweird right how mani dottsi do they get so i went to sit at the bar to wait for my dinner partner to arriv i sat and sat and watch the bartend tend to one end of the bar final a gentleman rais his voic and told the kid that i have been wait patient for a drink a broken glass later i secur a glass of prosecco soon after my dinner partner arriv and i want to cash out becaus our tabl was readi i wave my credit card at the bartend and he took his time come over dude if you dont want to serv me then come cash me out so im out of your hair sheesh 

we were seat in the a beauti dine area the restaur was pack with patron and buzz our waitress came to introduc herself and take our drink order i also order the pull mozzarella to start it arriv at our tabl and it was just your averag mozz noth mindblow 

for my entre i had the diver scallop that were accompani by a potato pure the scallop were cook perfect i guess the dish is an exercis in subtleti becaus noth wow me it was an aok dish it was almost push on bland the puf caper might have save the dish 

i tri my friend pasta and it was semicold he was a better sport than i and chose not to return it what threw me was that we were sit right next to the kitchen door how long was that pasta sit in the kitchen get cold 

all in all the dinner was good certain noth super creativ but definit tasti 

i return to boa for lunch i order the kobe burger with blue chees how do i say this gentl it was a salt lick the chees was veri salti to be put on top of a season burger i onli ate half of it an i was over it i did fill out a comment card and also told our waitress about it no offer for a new sandwich but i did eat half of it 

i see the potenti for caff boa it all there a good chef qualiti ingredi a creativ menu but theyr not all come togeth quit right mayb a tast dinner with comment card might be in order or mayb given time caff boa will becom a roar success i will be waiti dont realli have much to say about this place  there noth wrong with it but their dish dont pop for me  they are not veri flavor crazi for a thai place right and i often find myself ad fish sauc and chili just to get it to be good  lunch price are fair food seem fresh and servic is great  my cowork love this place and i enjoy their compani so i tag along

best part is they have soy milk for their thai tea  for me it the best part of the mealeom o airi een hat ca i t ou

the restaur itself is a bit rundown but the tabl and chair were clean even if the napkin dispens on the tabl wasnt i didnt feel itchi like i have in some place so i was quit all right with the cleanli i did have issu with peopl not have buffet etiquett  use the same plate to go back to the buffet line pick with their finger to get at food when there are tong there use a spoon in the tray to not onli get the food from that specif tray but to reach and get the stuff next to it becaus your too lazi to put the spoon down and use the proper alloc one boo to you i think it just came from live in vega and hit the buffet with famili and friend when theyd roll into town  vega was pretti strict and they had no qualm in tell you to get a fresh plate and to not cross contamin the utensil anyway i digres

it rare to eat at a chines buffet that isnt greasyand this wasnt greasi the select was pretti big and the fruit was so good i was realli taken by surpris by this whole place  food was fresh and actual good they didnt use msg and they didnt dous everyth with soy sauc and salt

but

i was enjoy my food untila biiiiig girl in a tiiiiiini denim miniskirt with the word delici embroid on the back part of her butt bent over andmuch to my horror and chagrin show me a cat i did not care to see it look so angry

mi eye well up with tear and my friend thought i was choke until she follow my line of sight oh dear god was all she could say even the gamer were render speechless it was a total bond moment between our two tables

what has been seen cannot be unseen

oh dear god indeed

indedrop in here for lunch today to discov a fair small but comfort sort of place  i found a nice booth  then saunter over to the serv area but to find onli 21 tray of food  eek  that dinki for a chines buffet plus a tv was blab out an informerci  so far we were at 2star  weak one at that

i decid to reach for the egg flower soup instead of my key  back at the tabl it was good  serverita show up was friend  also agre to turn down the tv so i began to warm up to the place

yelpi gripe about oili fri rice  well it was delici pork fri rice here  it wasnt oili  in fact i thought everyth was fine  look at the amaz low price  ill go back

lunch buffet 495this last time we got the big caramba which is a beef burro serv enchilada style it certain was big ill give them that i swear the tortilla they use were 2 feet across and they use two of them for each burro 

but it was so bland and goopi this was actual confirm of what ive experienc the last few visit it seem their food has gotten more flavorless and sloppistop in for lunch just after 11 today  the park was alreadi almost full even though there were plenti of empti tabl insid  the sign that i didnt see for a coupl of minut said to seat myself so i pick a tabl  just by myself i would have like a two top but all of the seat arrang seem to be 46  the restaur never fill up so i didnt feel bad for take a space away  

i got a two item lunch special 725 of a beef taco and a chees enchilada with bean i could have had rice rather than bean  i also got a root beer 205  most of their drink have an extra charg for refil but this was not a small glass and was plenti  right after i seat myself a bowl of warm chip a small mix bowl a caraf of mild salsa and a bottl of hot sauc were on the tabl  it was neat be abl to adjust the heat of my salsa  the shred beef was veri tasti and the shell was thin and crisp without be hard to bit through  i would suggest eat the taco quick befor the shell get soggi the enchilada and the bean were ok  the sauc was a bit differ than some other places

th servic was quick and attent  you can tell they are use to get the lunch crowd in and out in a reason amount of time

they have a coupl of other weekday lunch special as well as some smaller appetit option of  their regular menu item that can be order anytimstop in here for lunch today join by scott w  mike c  let get the notsogood out of the way first

thi ok but ordinari sitdown restaur is expens  while they have small lunch special for 725 2 small entre item  one side a regular combo meal cost 1150 even at lunch time  regard the food they serv thin chip  i like them the thicker the better

ok the good  the chip came with serv contain of both chunki mild  pure hot salsa that you can mix togeth for yourself into a littl bowl they give each person if you like  that was nice  also i appreci the pitcher of ice water  you can just pour yourself some more without ani fanfare

mi 1 combo includ a shred beef taco a shred beef tamal  a chees enchilada plus rice  refri bean  everyth was good especi the enchilada  the portion generous  you dont leav hungri from this place     this use to be my goto chines place over 10 year ago well let just say my tast have becom more sophist caus it just your averag run if the mill chineseamerican food with no surpris or intrigue

th chow fun was pretti good and the tofu was accept i just cant imagin how this was my goto place so long ago was i realli that blind i was still in my twenti what did i know      weekday lunch buffet      

the correct address for this peter piper is phoenix 85031 not glendal 85301 in case yelp hasnt fix it by the time you read this

pet piper has suffer quit a few close due to the recess but theyr still by far the largest buffet chain in the valley with 28 locat open at the time of this write  i stop in for a first visit to this one today to give it a tri  it veri nice insid as a pizza parlor seem to be spotless clean has lot of comfort booth and the staff was friend and right on top of things

i start with some of each of their three differ toss green salad all of which were good  then it was on to slice of some of the 12 differ toasti pizza that were out plus warm bread sticks

go back up for some more there was a somewhat differ select and they also invit me to have ani pizza i would like for them to custom bake  i was fine with what was out

sorri critic  sinc they upgrad the ingredi a while back the pizza here isnt all that bad and this was a nice lunch consid the low price of 549     i have now been here 3 time  this place is sort of an icon in glendal and i had been hear that i had to go here sinc i move here 17 year ago

th first time i was here was mother day and i order the special breakfast of chicken crepe with a fruit bowl  it was cold the spinach had the textur of shoe leather the alfredo sauc had separ then form a skin  the fruit bowl it came with was ok as was the coffe and the mini muffin with butter were realli good

th next time i went for lunch and had that day special which was a  hot turkey sandwich with potato salad  the sandwich was ok the potato salad was bland but the season salt on the tabl made it ok 

this last time i had the cook breakfast of two pancak two egg two sausag or bacon and i ad some potato  the breakfast was lukewarm  the pancak and potato were pretti good the egg and sausag were just ok  as note befor the mini muffin serv with real butter were realli good

ev bodi i encount was pleasant  the place is look a bit worn  when i was there the place was one to two third full  i notic this last trip the line of chair and the coffe station outsid were miss  i fulli understand that the banter between the waitress and the regular custom is one of the thing that bring peopl back i just wish it didnt caus my food to be serv lukewarm as i saw other plate serv that were still steaming

i gave it a 3 but it is a pretti weak 3 and although i would go there again if somebodi els pick it i doubt it will make it into my regular rotateveri meal come with a kiss we were inform short after sit down i was go to ask if we had to cook our own food or how that whole thing work out but didnt

ktc was a solid 3 star for our breakfast this morn i order the canjun bene paul the belgian waffl and jason the biscuit and gravi three order of mini muffin arriv short thereaft with real butter and appl butter that was at the tabl as other have state the muffin were great our meal arriv in a time manner and we all dug in paul polish off his waffl prompt while jason and i slowli enjoy our meal i honest have to say i wish i didnt eat so mani muffin becaus i wasnt abl to finish my egg which were wonder the creol season ad to the hollandais sauc ad a terrif flavor and just a littl heat

th decor made me feel like i was back home in northwest ohio that doesnt add the the appeal for me but some enjoy those things

whil servic dure our meal was attent i drink a lot of water dure a meal and their glass were pretti small but i was refil sever time howev after our plate were clear we sat around for almost ten minut befor we could flag down our server for the bill which was when we also receiv our kiss hershey kiss cute but i rare eat candi still cuteharold is worth the drive up north if your look for a good ol countri  biker bar to drink beer listen to countri music andor watch steeler game it a huge space with sever room insid and a great big outdoor patio too  up until my most recent visit i might have told you that the servic and food were pretti consist too but unfortun both the servic and food suck dure our last visit

sinc ive been go to harold for year though im stick to a 3 star review in hope that our last experi was a fluke in the past ive enjoy both the beef rib and the salmon entre at harold  i went for a steak salad last visit and was extrem disappoint  it was pretti nasti i also found it funni that when my bf ask about the soup of the day the waitress said it was clam chowder and that it was good when fresh but she didnt recommend it the day we were there huh that kinda make you wonder

harold doe offer steam broccoli as well as plenti of other side item includ french fri coleslaw bake potato and more  their menu is huge with someth for everyon but i think nadia c has the right idea in go to harold for beer and burgergo on wedesday or friday  it quit a hike up to cave creek but it worth it   real bull ride and it pack full of peopl everyon in cave creek and their grandma is at buffalo chip  the place itself is huge with a danc floor restaur area multipl bar arm wrestl station hilari outdoor eat area outdoor bar rodeo area and it right around a bunch of other bar within walk distanc some are veri biker barish so bewar but tri harold corral next door  

the rodeo is awesom and they appar have amateur night which is somewhat shock to me but mayb they put you on a littl poni or in a full suit of armor     

great western crowd more cowboy hat and boot wear folk than ive ever seen in one place  

in my book you are a winner if you even attempt the arm wrestl machin that thing is freakish strong and make you feel like a wimp 

live countri music is fantast and everyon is out there danc and swing around so much fun danc realli is the best part of nightlif in my book and i total love the countri western danc at buffalo chip  

warn  do not park on the street even if everyon els is do it  those cave creek patrol are nasti and i got a whop 200 park ticket as did the other 12 car on the street  youv been warn yelper 

this is whi i have to give four star the cruel and unusu park ticket left a sour tast in my mouth35 stars

merc is definit gear for the sun citi crowd but has some good thing to offer  if you have an elder famili member or friend in sun citi you should realli think about come here  you are greet warm everi time your order is taken prompt and food make it to your tabl in a reason amount of time  this all equal to a pleasur experi plus they have a larg place that can also take in larg group  the menu has mani option and the meal are good old fashion plate you would get at a diner  the meal are on the low sodium side but as i mention abov this place is just on the outskirt of sun citi  ive alway have been here for dinner but their breakfast menu look good too  i cant rememb but they have all you can eat pancak on one weekend saturday i think day  dont worri folk they do have two larg flat screen tvs with cabledish too  your elder famili or friend will enjoy this place and whi not come here if your abl to put a smile on their facewent here for lunch with fellow yelper mike c rand h and arlin b  i got real excit about the fact they offer liver and onion the day were go and even though i like mine a littl on the well done side that particular dish was a real disappoint  most of the other dish were accept and better  while noth realli stood out as great the overal valu of the place is veri good  there was enough varieti of dish should keep almost anybodi happi  be in sun citi most of the clientel is older but there was plenti of work folk there toocame back again on mon around noon with my 2 daughter and grand daughter in tow for our pete fix noth much has chang from my previous review and updat save two the shrimp are now a littl smaller overal but larger piec of shrimp insid the batter and the price have gone up our order of fish combo 2 fish 5 shrimp and fri 7 piec shrimp and fri and 8 piec chicken nugget came to 2180 not count 2  atm charg for cash got our food quick and pipe hot even dure lunch rush be care if you go lot of road work on van buren in front of pete and other busi prob be awhil for our next fixgood but not great friend empty

th abov captur my experi at pizzafarro an intend quick stop befor catch a flight back to a strang and distant habitat where 95 is consid hot arriv short after 5 on a tuesday we were the onli dinein patron until right befor we left when a lone diner arriv signal either a general or specif offseason

w settl on a loaf of garlic bread without melt chees 350 and a twotop larg 16 23 with spinach and mushroom a brief asid  i come from the land of ny style pizza and current live in the land of not much resembl pizza under that len the garlic bread was a bit weak on the garlic and it was the best and will be the best pizza ive had in month with the right amount of oil and chees but the standard crust was a bit too hard and dri for me to appreci it when compar to my memori of pizza in the ny area and the price seem a bit high even for a boutiqu communiti 

pizzafarro has most a monopoli on it market in it surround neighborhood and histori to sustain it sinc the commerci zone of carefre and cave creek are practic nonexist for a near the onli game in town establish for conveni or in a hurri one could do far wors but there are better option consid nypd if one doesnt mind a short drive alreadi an arizona resid requirwith so mani corpor option near by i was elat when mother decid that dillon is where she want to go for her birthday not becaus the food is awesom or anyth like that but becaus they are still independ and success 

for year and year weve been come to dillon and i have to say that they are consist okay back in the day when the menu was smaller and their meat platter came with garlic bread twist this was one of my favorit doe anyon rememb the bread twist oh those were awesom 

the bbq here is alright not bad not great just stuck somewher in the middl mother btw love her chicken club sandwich and imho one of the onli thing to order on the menu fri chicken breast bacon ham and cheddar chees on a bun it shine in it pork fayyt goodbe an arizona nativ well phoenix metro more specif i grew up in the west valley back then it was an entir differ landscap there was no loop 101 no arrowhead town center and no walgreen on everi corner back then there were farm of cotton and orang grove as far as your eye could see dure the springtim the intox smell of orang blossom fill the air with their sweet fragranc it was amaz today almost all of the orang tree have been pave over to make way for so call progress and what was is now a distant memori 

while the west valley appear to be pretti much like ani other part of the valley or the nation for that matter landscap by corpor america there are a few place my famili frequent that have manag to surviv one place in particular bring back some of my earliest experi with mexican food top shelf for over 30 year top shelf has been make simpl yet delici mexican food in the west valley im not talk about anyth fanci just tasti burrito enchilada and larg plate fill with red and green chile all hearti comfort and ohso satisfi 

natur onc sat your treat to a larg bowl of fresh chunki mild salsa and hot salti chip this is someth that mani newer mexican joint just dont do a sign of the time i guess what usual goe great with your chip and salsa an origin top shelf margarita 675 though their version had a bit too much margarita mix which made it acid  after onli a few sip it didnt matter that much 

ani mexican place i visit i alway will order a chees crisp 555 with lettuc and tomato ever sinc i can rememb eat here the top shelf version has alway had the perfect balanc of crunchi tortilla to gooey chees ratio the addit of fresh veggi and a few spoon of salsa make for a health and delici appet well in my mind anyway 

quit a few place around town serv up a fajita burrito fundido 1495 though onli a few get it right in the top shelf version they take grill chicken or beef wrap it in a huge flour tortilla then deep fri until it brown and crispi on top they then cover it with jalapeno cream chees and melt cheddar chees and it serv with bean  rice while i onli had a few bite in order to save room for other item the tender chicken was so moist and flavor they didnt even have to put chees on it

year ago it was at top shelf that i had my first exposur to red chile they take cube of lean pork then simmer them in a bath of red chile gravi with the number 8 combo 1320 you not onli get a massiv plate with a red chile burrito you also get a chees enchilada beef taco plus rice and bean whew it took me some time to finish but i felt proud of myself for accomplish this 

while the smell of orang blossom is gone the tast of mexican food remain free chip and allmeh it fine for what it is a hole in the wall taqueria chain with cheap price and lower qualiti food i dont understand those who scoff at roberto but act like fausto is some michelin 3 star restaur in comparison theyr practic ident in the crap they serv you carn asada burrito is usual realli dri unless you ask for it to be load up with guac and sour cream chicken enchilada are edibl but i hate the tast of their tortilla and general just extract the chicken and drench it in cholula becaus it is alway that dri also if your rave about carn asada friesi mean what kind of culinari feat is throw togeth bunch of fatten food and mix it togeth of cours it go to tast good the ladi work the front is cordial enough the other night i ask her for a water cup while i wait for my food she said they no longer offer courtesi cup becaus 95 of peopl lie and got soda protect your syrup at all costbig bang

hav just return sever pound heavier from vacat i was starv for some breakfast  my friend and i sift through yelp and found this gem  actual we pass it a coupl of time befor we found it  i swear if we werent look for it wed not have known it existed

im veri excit to have found this littl diner in downtown hendo and to support local own busi  i order a cup of coffe and simpl petit platter consist of bacon scrambl egg toast and fruit cup  

the coffe to my surpris was illi which is my favorit brand of espresso ground  definit earn point with me  my friend comment that it was on the strong side while i thought it was a littl weaker than my prefer  dont get me wrong i brew my coffe to be like oil and drink the sludg that come out with the last pour so when i say it weak take it with a packet of sugar  

the platter was generous size with a big smatter of egg and a shit ton of bacon  if you know me the way to my stomach is to clog my arteri with bacon greas  i swear there were about 6 piec of bacon on my plate mayb i look like i could use a few more pound  

good thing though becaus the egg were not verytasti  my mother in law add milk to her egg to make them fluffi but these egg seem to have a bit too much  ketchup was requir to make them more appetizingh deduct 2 star  

the fruit cup was a nice touch with orang slice cantaloup and grape to offset the bacon fat  not necessari but welcom in my belli  throw in the toast and you have a breakfast  

as a whole this was a fill breakfast and did the job  sure the egg werent all they were crack up to be sorri i couldnt help but be punni but when you consid that this entir meal cost just penni over 7 per person after tax you get quit a bang for your bucki final dine at chicago joe after long want to sampl the classic italian fare of this downtown fixtur  despit high hope for a great meal after finish a fivecours dinner here i am sorri to report that i was underwhelm by veri uninspir cook  

an appet of arancini serv with duo sauc of marinara and alfredo was okay but on the dri side  unwarm italian bread and butter and a beani bowl of pasta fagioli tast good  a fair simpl salad of green a coupl of tomato slice a touch of carrot and a black oliv with a vinaigrett dress was fine but noth special  and then came the realli disappoint entry

mi 33 entre of veal  pepper with mushroom and onion and an includ pasta side was extrem pedestrian  beyond pound the veal was ultrathin not veri tender and actual resembl luncheon meat  and the strand of pepper that top the meat seem like they had been shave off a thicker veget base  howev the spaghetti bolognes with mushroom that came with the entre was good and hearti  

an averages cannoli tast good but was rather ordinari while a larg slice of chocol cheesecak that was not hous made was excel  servic was good and the ambianc in this veri small eateri homey and comfort  but i doubt i will be back

ther are just too mani other better italian restaur in the las vega valley to warrant a returni recal this place be a lot better befor i have been there for dinner and from what i rememb the portion were larg ingredi fresh and price reason a co worker and i were in the area and decid to tri chicago joe for lunch the server was help and attent but he gave my co worker a glass with a huge crack down the middl that could have end veri badly
th lunch special are pricey for the amount of food that you get we opt for a chicken parmigiana for 995 it consist of a small scoop of cold pasta in an over sweet pasta sauc and a piec of bread chicken no larger than the palm of my hand the chicken also had gristl which was veri gross overal the tast of the food was solid the price were too high for what you get and the servic was solid enough i wouldnt rush back here againwhen tri to decid where to catch the  world cup game and enjoy lunch central to both our locat my husband and i settl on dona maria we sat at the bar and order a diet coke and my pregnanc drink of choic raspberri ice tea the staff was courteous enough although we wait about 1015 for the menus to be brought over 
the complimentari chip and salsa tast veri complimentari stale chip and salsa that tast like marinara sauc we opt for 6 tamal pork beef chees chicken x2 and sweet  i had beef and chicken and thought they were ok but slight dri i had to drench them in cholula sauc for ad moistur  also the tamal were relat small the tab was close to 25 which is pretti standard for a mid rang qualiti restaur id say this was pure a conveni thing and base on the food i would have no desir to go backluca is a realli odd space it a restaur hous in an old church in fact this church accord to our server was the veri first church in vega ever i believ it too base on the size shape and design of the interior

luca serv up breakfast and italian which is anoth odditi about the place becaus those two thing in combin seem like a strang choic but there you have it they onli serv breakfast until 1030 so if you get there after that youv got to go with lunch options

they do offer a realli cheap salad and pizza buffet but i would say the choic and qualiti of this buffet do match the price tag after all your go to get what you pay for after look this over i decid to go with an italian sandwich that i realli enjoy it was basic mozzarella and italian meat with a tapenad spread on a delici bread

th price are pretti low and the servic was nice so i would possibl be up for tri it again if i live in the area howev it wasnt so remark that id make a conscious effort to go again just on a return visit to vegavega is fill with steakhous  palazzo alon has three of them  so with so mani option on the strip it go to have to take a pretti good recommend for me to stray off the strip for my savori appetit  hugo cellar was recommend to us by one of our custom and he mention that it was one of the best steak he has ever had  big word when it come to steak in vega and it was mention to us dure dinner at delmonico  nonetheless my girlfriend and i made it our mission to tri hugo the next time we were in vega  here is the short of it

pros
your ladi friend get a rose when you enter the restaur  the amount of food you get for 50 dollar steak is a lot  you get bread chocol cover strawberri salad and potato or vegetables
reason price compar to most if not all a la cart steakhouses

cons
decor is more old school or hasnt been chang in a while  fit in well with the fremont street casinos
th steak and the meal were just ok for me  i definit left full but i wouldnt necessarili say it was melt in your mouth or the steak was anyth to write home about  

vega con 
in a citi where imag can be anyth this place just doesnt cut it  it in a cellar and it is on fremont street  there are so mani other choic in vega that can give you a better view or a more comfort seat or give you better recognit or name  
the crowd is older not as dressi and fit more with the surround  i wore dark jean and a nice shirt standard guywear and i felt overdress  

in the end though i would eat there again  howev one has to understand the type of meal you are get and what you are pay for  with that in hand it one of the best deal on the striphugo cellar and i got off on the wrong foot right away  we didnt have reserv and were told that there would be a 30 minut wait  no problem on the wait but we just want some appet or someth to munch on becaus my friend is diabet and he need to eat someth small right away to balanc his blood sugar  i wait patient as the bartend tend to one waiter after anoth  i final ask him for some chees and cracker and he total ignor me  the hostess knew that i was get hot and she sat us right away

now i dont know the intricaci of the food industri  but appar this place doe everyth the old school way and they do it top notch  i had to listen to my friend describ how a butter rose was made how time consum it was to make a good bordelais sauc and how the napkin under the creme brule was a difficult fold to make

i was still piss about the bartend ignor me  plus i question whether or not they got my order correct  i order the rib eye steak medium rare  there wasnt much marbl on the steak and it look and tast more like the ny strip

valuewis this place is fantast  most other nice restaur would have all the dish alacartseedi spot for 1 daiquiri and yard mix drink price arent bad so it a good place for tourist ive never gone when there wasnt a line but it move pretti quick make sure to grab your free bead on the way in also one of the last place around where you can find slot machin that actual pay out and take coincute littl sandwich shop behind the mcdonald on decatur  flamingo small but still kinda cozi the peopl that work here are cool and friend i got a small meal the bobbi meal so the price was cheap they dont have sprite coke pepsi just mountain dew  7up they dont have ani name brand chip here either which isnt a big deal at all to the norm but if your a foodi like me i like to have my varieti of flavor chip i want to see what all the buzz about the bobbi was about i like the combin of cranberri stuf turkey  mayo becaus you cant even tast the mayo but it honest wasnt a wow factor it was a good meal with okay price next time ill bring my hot sauc bottl 

ps they dont carri avocadounfortun this review is downgrad to a 3 star rate 

time for an updat sinc i have been back a few time after my last visit as mention befor their origin dba was el taco fresco everyth is the same howev i think they have trim the portion size of their food and increas price a bit

i often place my order then walk through the adjoin door to money play bar and grab a beer and wait for my food which they will walk over to me when readi mexican food and an ice cold beer is a veri nice combin in my book and i am not much of a beer drinker

w order roll taco excus me i mean taquito as they call them in san diego ca where i am from the old school taco shop call them roll taco as they realli are i never heard of the term taquito until i move to los angel anyhow of cours dont forget the chees and guacamol well just dont expect much chees or guacamol as the amount was laughabl and yes they charg extra for guacamol in which they are veri stingi with onli two out of my five taquito had enough guacamol to enjoy a pet peev of mine is if you charg extra for it then make sure you give a fair amount they were tighter than a tick as with the guacamole

i was crave carn asada so i got a burrito this visit i was disappoint in the size as it was veri small and not veri meati if i order a carn asada burrito i want to tast a decent amount of meat this burrito was the smallest and least fill i have ever had the opportun to consum  it did not even look right it was so small and empti the shape was not even of a burrito but rather more similar to the shape of a pear i was veri disappoint thank good i split an order of taquito with my sweeti or i would have left just as hungri as when i walk in

i will give them some time and check back as i am turn off at the moment 

the name chang in my opinion has onli brought higher price and less foodyou are not go to get a tradit irish pub in vega it just not go to happen that would be like say that the venetian make you feel just like you are float down a canal in itali or that the new york new york is the big appl of your eye hell if this were true we could all just flock to vega and come home say we travel the worldand save a lot on airfar in the process no this is not a possibl 

what you get in vega are suggest and small glimps of place that actual exist done up in bright light with a dash of tacki and a facad of what the real thing might slight resembl 

the farther away from the strip that you get the less inher these qualiti are so sinc it is a bit out of the way mcmullan is not a bad rendit of an irish pub they pour a good guin are one of the few place that carri magner in vega and mani of their menu item are tradit pub fare they howev seem to be like mani establish in vega tri too hard and overdo it a bit 

nice switch from the glitter and glam of the strip price more local friend and a varieti of band most everi night of the week not a bad place but if you want a true irish pub ireland would be a good place to lookthe compani i work for order breakfast from here for christma eve

i have had takeout from here mani time and it is general good most hot and almost alway correct

i was a littl disappoint sinc it is liter 1 block away the gravi on my biscuit was cold and they complet forgot my hashbrowns

bacon was nice and crispi but what the hell it was free

cost them 1 star for screw it upi call and order the countri scram for breakfast  this time they got it right2 scrambl egg over 2 biscuit cover in sausag gravi with hashbrown  4 strip of bacon 6 and they deliv it was good with the hashbrown this timelook for a quick bite on this side of town jackson bar  grill came up in my search  walk through the bar the dine area is in the back with day time soap take over the television

th husband order their jack daniel tritip sandwich 999 and it came with your choic of french fri cole slaw cup of soup or side salad  he opt for the french fri  he thought the sandwich was pretti tasti and he was happi with his choice

i went for their chicken finger 649 which you can choos how you would like them  i went for spici hope for some much need kick  unfortun it look like it would be spici but it definit was not  it was more on the mild side of thing  the four finger came with carrot and celeri stick and their homemad ranch dress  it was just averag noth special  

it look like the thing to get here is their 699 steak special though  a 9 oz steak choic of fri slaw or ring steam veggi and a dinner salad all for onli 699 24 hour a day group are welcom  all that for 699 and serv all day sound like a pretti good deal to me 

they also still accept the entertain book couponthe quest continu on to chang hong kong cuisin to find a decent dim sum spot in vega  chang is a smaller venu compar to orchid garden over on w sahara

arriv in the middl of the saturday lunch rush i was seat immedi even without my parti of four present  the tabl set up was a bit awkward and i found myself rearrang the chair and place set befor the rest of my dine companion arrived

th dim sum cart came roll by and i do admit they had a better select than orchid  we immedi got the shrimp dumpl and pork dumpl  we also order a few random dumpl in a more transluc type skin similar to the shrimp dumpl skin  the chicken in the black bean sauc was a bit drier than other place and not as flavor  we tri mushroom on tofu that was tasti and had the beef rice noodl and shrimp rice noodl  both the bf and the cousin enjoy their soft tofu which was sweeter here than other places

i think we were impress by their wider select that we forgot to inquir about the elus shanghai dumpl or shark fin dumpl soup  next time for sure

i was crave some sweet to close out my meal and had the egg custard tart  they had three small tart to an order and they just came out of the oven  these were definit yummi  i would go back just for these  they had the pineappl bun but not the kind with egg custard insid  bummer

servic was okay  becaus the busboy are a bit overanxi to clear your tabl they will consolid your dish for you this is someth i have alway hate unless it was necessari to do so  i dont particular enjoy watch the busboy bang the steamer against anoth steamer on your tabl so the lone pork dumpl will join the other lone shrimp dumpl just to have one less dish on the tabl  i mean for gawd sake are they short on dish in the back

overal despit the lipstick mark found on the bfs water glass i would give chang hong kong cuisin a solid 35 star  they have a decent select of dim sum choic but could fair better on servic and qualiti  so far they match up pretti competit with orchid for now  but the search continu on to find a place that offer a wider select and yummi tasti morsel of dim sum to satisfi this sf girl

tot bill 40 and chang not includ tip

upd 102607  recent host a dinner here for about 40 peopl in one of their privat room  there were some peopl that were realli easi to work with and friend while there were a few other that could be a bit abrasive

our menu
 seafood chowder soup  pretti good i have this soup a lot but i never knew it went by this name  chunk of seafood and tofu in a thick broth  
 peke duck 32  the skin is separ on anoth plate so you can start use them with the twelv bun provid  then the duck meat come along on a differ plate
 walnut prawn 1395  jumbo shrimp with candi walnut on a bed of broccoli  beauti present and eaten all up
 mongolian beef 895  not a particular favorit of mine but eaten up by my fellow diners
 steam chicken countri style half 1195  i like steam chicken but the chicken head can be a bit of a distract for those who mayb shock by it  light flavor and with a littl white pepper yum
 fish filet with blackbean sauc 995  a fave by someon els but it was okay for me  i prefer my fish steam instead of stirfried
 bake pork cutlet with season salt 995  tasti but it look like we got all the littl bit while the other tabl got the larg piec of pork
 stringbean szechuan style 895  i prefer my stringbean brais or doubl fri  this was pretti standard noth special
 chang crispi fri noodl 995  huge order and load with veggi and seafood bit  a good valu for the money

servic wise  the food came too fast  with so mani order come out our guest bare had a chanc to make a dent into one dish befor anoth dish would come  there was never enough room on the tabl and it would be nice if the waitstaff assist with condens the dish onto smaller one instead of just pour them togeth  they probabl should work better as a team to make sure there is room on each lazi susan befor come out with each platter  they were better at refil water tea and rice pot in the begin of the meal but slack off near the end  they did bring us a knife to cut the cake and offer to cut it for us too extra napkin to go box etc  some polish up on custom servic overal could definit use some improv  

overal chang work out well for our dinner parti  they were easi to work with in make our own menu and provid suggest  we also came earli to decor the room which work out well toometro pizza is a las vega local pizza place it not cheap but they are pretti consistent

most recent we had a lunch cater in at work and everyth was quit good

th deliveri  setup man was fantast he made sure we had everyth and extra

w order the salad garlic knot bake ziti and chicken parmesan the food was hotcheesi and the chicken had crunch 

i couldnt find myself shell out 40 for pizza  breadstick but it was a nice treative been here on quit a few occas and i have to say that ive never been entir enthral by this place 

the food is just ok noth amaz the pasta is generic and not particular flavor a littl on the overpr side as well i enjoy the garlic bread which is pretti good i have had some veri good bake ziti so that been the save grace here 

the servic is ok but i get irk at have to wait for a tabl here there alway a long wait there are better italian restaur in town and there are worsblack bear diner has been in busi sinc 1926 contrari to what the name might impli to some peopl black bear diner did not start out serv bear meat it start as an inn in mount shasta california that overlook a strawberri patch that was inhabit by both peopl and black bear approxim nineti year later black bear diner seem to be a healthi busi they have sever locat includ this veri one at the northwest corner of tropicana avenu and jone boulevard  

 black bear diner oper by six 6 credo i have put each credo to the test this review list each credo with yelp feedback pleas bear with me while i grow my yelp into a growl while i give feedback on each of the six credos

credo 1 we will make black bear diner a place where you can feel comfort and relax we offer you great food and an experi reminisc of a time when a smalltown restaur was the place to go for talk friendship and atmosphere

a yelper growl on my visit that occur dure the afternoon of june 22 and the morn of june 23 2013 the lodg theme made me relax there is noth like a hundr stuf bear to make me feel at eas black bear diner remind me more of a bear theme cracker barrel than a smalltown restaur the menu which mimic a newspap and the place mat were interest read materi be in the inform age where friend especi yelp friend are within the touch of a handheld devic i could say that the excel verizon recept contribut to make this a place for friendship

credo 2 we are dedic to serv fresh prepar home cook from scratch sausag and biscuit to our legendari black bear cobbler everyon at black bear diner goe the extra mile to provid you with the best in good old fashion famili food prepar fresh everi day

a yelper growl base on the shasta cheeseburg with fri that i ate on june 22 and the bear choic breakfast special that i ate on june 23 i thought that the food was good yet not extraordinari i would have appreci more chees on the shasta cheeseburg warmer fri and a choic of syrup and top for the pancakes

credo 3 we deliv each meal just the way you order it

a yelper growl this ought to be mention when the server take your order when i order the bear choic breakfast this would have been nice if it was brought to my attent i would of enjoy more beacon instead of pancakes

credo4 we believ in valuehearti portion of good food we buy huge platter and we fill them so dont be afraid to take leftov home

a yelper growl the portion are huge howev i feel that instead of fill up a lot of the plate with fri that they ought to replac some of them with the choic of potato salad or cole slaw for the record fri are not the kind of food that tast good warm up 


credo 5 we featur healthi option becaus we care about our customers

a yelper growl i do not go to a diner especi name black bear to eat healthi i say good for them for featur healthi option i would like to add that all the stuf bear and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health stuf bear have a way of reduc my stress level 

credo 6 if you have comment that bear repeat pleas tell us if you have extraordinari servic or have someth to growl about we want to hear from you pleas visit our websit to let us know how we are doing

a yelper growl growl on busi websit is not my style my style is to growl on yelp with that in mind my growl of black bear diner is 3  12 stars

th daniel s 2013 yelp 100 challeng this is review 90im all for support local busi this momnpop taqueriaesqu shop is locat in the walmart plaza off of rainbow and spring mountain it small and unassum both insid and out the ladi at the counter the owner perhap was veri friend and happi to talk about everyth on the menu while i stare at it

sh sold me on the al pastor burrito 550 i love pork and this place is call the famous burrito so i figur it had to be good two minut after order the food was readi surpris quick yes it take me longer to make toast in the morn i couldnt see back in the kitchen where it was made but i dont think the al pastor come off a spit a la taco el gordo more like it sit in a tray like chipotl wait to be served

whil it wasnt a massiv burrito it was larg enough  fill with plenti of rice onion cilantro and bean the pork live up to it bill provid plenti of heat with an array of spice not quit on the level of taco el gordo pastor but still aok the burrito also came with a small bag of tortilla chip not a bad option if your in the area and want some cheap eati went back for anoth visit in hope of keep or rais my previous 4 star rate no such luck and to my dismay end up drop to a 3 star which is more adequ as a result of my most recent visit 

i was less than impress this time around even more so than my last visit and in between

mi littl sister and i were crave sushi at 1am they are open until 2am so we swung by on a friday night it was dead which was cool we just walk right up to the bar and sat

w did not do ayc as it was so late we just want our sushi crave satisfied

w order the special which is not on the menu two full shrimp tempura roll salad and miso soup all for 11 a fantast deal as a singl roll cost more than that we ate one roll and took one home for munchi later

th servic was ok not realli much servic to be had unless you order ayce

our sushi roll were most rice veri littl tast of the avocado crab or shrimp in which the roll is call shrimp tempura 

they have definit downsiz as far as product to rice roll portion we realli like the eel sauc howev we do not want to have to dunk it in just to add tast realli tast just like white rice with eel sauc consum the roll solo was bland and flavorless

i am disappoint as they use to be good

a visit at 1am is not the best either as they close at 2am and start close the sushi bar down and clean up so we did feel a bit rush to eat and get the hell out of there

a good deal in price is not a reason i would come back anytim soon

i much prefer qualiti over quantiti and price valu 

there is a reason they were dead on a friday night as other sushi joint are poppin on a weekend

i wont be back sad to say too mani other great option avail right here in las vegaif i had seen a chines restaur in the vicin of charli fria park that is rate high i would of made it lunch i am a fan of the chines restaur lunch special they are one of the best deal in town i didnt do my homework and after burn fuel drive around i want to grab lunch and get on with explor charli fria park i checkedin at the panda

  these day my opinion of the panda has chang the averag 9 plus tax transact for a two item combo and medium beverag trail behind the price of genuin chines restaur especi at lunch 

  in my book panda express is a good choic when it is in a larg place with a captiv audienc or when the area lack good chines restaur this locat is an exampl it is in a locat where a transient stretch of tropicana merg into las vega communiti the major of restaur are fast food eateri in the shadow of the orlean when i dine here it is more out of conveni than hunger in my situat it was near charli fria park a quick yet creepi walk

  this panda has a larg footprint i cannot see a problem with ever get a tabl 

  the chicken with mushroom fri rice they also have brown and chow mein was fast food good  where panda outbeat local chines restaur lunch special is in their chow mein at the local restaur i often leav over the chow mein noodl where in panda the chow mein noodl on my plate turn to air problem chicken with mushroom was not my food of choic this locat suffer from what i call the panda syndrom this is a major flaw when the food tray are empti caus a present of metal and cook oil to put it kind this look bad they would be do the custom a favor by put a cover over the empti food tray possibl show a panda with a frown say sorri we will be cook new food

  when there is a good chines restaur nearbi and i am unrush i will probabl pass over panda howev when i am hungri and want to move on the panda will probabl get some of my checkin lovei like the atmospher at littl buddha  it was warm and relax upscal and classy

th servic was veri strong

i start with a bowl of miso soup  5  it was veri good  it had lot of seawe which gave it a bit of an ocean tast  i would have like a littl more tofu

next i had a platter call the king roll  it was made up of rather ordinari thing for a japanes restaur combin in a way i thought was unusu  the roll was sever shrimp tempura  wrap around that was rice and seawe  then a layer of spici tuna finish with a layer of avocado  it was tasti and interest but didnt realli wow me  there were 10 slice for 20 buck  i think finish the roll with avocado just made for too much avocado  it pretti richthis isnt far from my mil place so we pick up some food it famous it close by and i havent had a stromboli in year 

so insid it is definit old school it look like it hasnt chang in decad but not in a bad way more like this place is a no frill institut the one thing that did chang is the barrier of the front bar is smoke and the dine is complet glass in so no need to avoid it if your smoke sensit 

we were a bit confus how this place kinda work for togo so we get a ticket at the window and pay at the bar but onc we figur that out we got out there fast 

meatbal stromboli  definit good the meatbal was tender and definit homemad the actual dough had some crunch on the outsid but was chewi insid i enjoy it enough 

turkey ham and swiss stromboli  this was just okay the bf didnt like the type of turkey slice they use in this i felt it need someth i say go for stromboli with red sauc in it 

we didnt know how fill these will be so we got a larg meatbal and a small turkey and that was way more than enough we had left over 

we also got some chicken tender and fri these are typic bar tender and tast like mani bar so definit premad but alright anyway their medium sauc is more vinegari than spici 

ill probabl be back for a meat and red sauc base stromboli and probabl wont mess with anyth elsover the last coupl month ive been bounc back and forth between the recent purchas new abod and the old hous that current in escrow  numer meet with contractor at the new place back to the old place to meet realtor contractor inspector blah blah blah  a few week back i decid everi time i have to be at the new place to meet a contractor after the meet ill hit a breakfast place

it been age sinc ive been to lous so i decid to includ it on my breakfast place list

plac look exact like it did when i tri it over 4 year ago  i believ the cook was the same  is it lou   

order ham steak egg oe rye toast  i believ it was 8  i expect a lower price given low rent district presum low overhead given noth has chang in the place in over 4 year so mayb the serv size is ala hash hous a go go  uhhhhh that a negatory

food was averag  a littl too much oil puddl on the egg but not a big deal given the greas in the hash browns

prob closer to 25 star but i round up given the place for so dang long  prop to themawwwww cheddar bay biscuit 

realli what more can i add to cheddar bay biscuit  those thing must be made with crack becaus you will be addict after the first bite  yummy

ok ok now to the review  red lobster is an aok restaur in my book  i dont visit it often but when i do i alway enjoy my meal  it isnt fanci but it sure is tasti  the price are pretti reason for what you get  they often have great special like the 4 cours meal for 1499  and the best part unlimit cheddar bay biscuitsi   rl also has some great lunch special for when you want someth smaller and cheaper  most of the lunch special are 799 which is pretti good for some seafood   i alway feel like i got a great deal when the bill arriv for lunch or dinner  

the menu is pretti big and quit divers as well  if you like shrimp you are in luck becaus there alway seem to be at least a dozen differ type of shrimp  they also have lot of other seafood option to suit everyon in your group  dont like seafood  that ok too becaus they have steak chicken and beef option as well  everyon should be happi in your parti  if anyth everyon can just eat the unlimit cheddar bay biscuit  have i mention how amaz those sucker are yet yum

th food over all is ok  the dish are ok  noth is realli special or outstand but it get the job done  the super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup  it is super duper yummi and i think my favorit thing at rl  it is a chain restaur so at least you alway know what to expect no matter which locat you are at

th servic here is usual pretti good  they have a dud or 2 in the servic depart but that is everywher it seem  i dont requir much though just keep the cheddar bay biscuit come and my soda fill and i am head over heel happi  

the interior is ok as well  i know they want to be fanci but it is still just an ok interior  this locat was recent remodel though and is look a lot fresher

so the moral of the stori is that red lobster is ok  and guess what i will be back for some more cheddar bay biscuitmy mouth is openinsert cheesesteak pleas i like this joint i also like their sweet potato fri with coconut dip sauc mmmm yummi you can smell the good just drive pass this place

ord to go and take your sandwich home to enjoy that is the onli downfal is it is on the corner of a busi street and there is onli outdoor seat and it is alway windi and the pass traffic nois and smell of car whizz by is annoy tri this onc for five second was it enjoyablenot so much

anyhow to order big so that you get full make sure you bring your largest wad of money not exact the cheapest place in town to get grub for two of us to each order a larg sandwich and an order of sweet potato fri and one soda it set us back 38 buck serious not the spot you want to hit up when you are low on cash and tri to grub lolthis subway is locat in a food court near the imperi palac hotel onc in a while in vega you are just crave someth healthi luckili you can grab a healthyish sandwich at subway and eat it by the pool at the imperi palac that you would not dare to enter becaus of the layer of greas along the top your sando and diet coke can provid good refresh though2013 halohalo challeng  contend 10

our halohalo challeng stop at 10 locat with goldilock as our last contend  we decid earli that goldilock would be last becaus they have been around for quit some time with 21 locat in the us it was recommend by other and we rememb that their halohalo was pretti good  in other word we want to save the best for last  what we found was some inconsist to how i rememb goldilock halohalo to be  cost for their halohalo is 499 ingredi includ kaong pinipig nata de coco macapuno red bean ube ice cream lanka condens milk and shave ice all mix togeth  miss was real ube and flan  halohalo mean mixmix and that what you do to eat this treat  you start with this pretti dessert and you mix it  but what i found at goldilock is that they tend to mix mix what they put in their halohalo  ive had halohalo from goldilock from locat rang from their philippin norcal socal and now vega  i swear flan and even legit ube was in their mixmix i guess all locat are differ which left me disappoint when i didnt get what i want in their halohalo overal i still finish my halohalo but would not consid their as my favorit  sorri goldilock but you need flan and ube in your halohalo to make me happi 

like some of the other halohalo contend food was also tast test  i want their chicken bbq on a stick becaus the pictur on the menu look so delici but they were out and this wasnt the first time this happen to me  i end up with their half chicken bbq with garlic fri rice  just a note folksric is not includ with their meal  you have to order rice separ so dont assum your get it and they dont ask you either my meal still hit the spot my halohalo was just okay but at last their chicken bbq was good  

ps  we commit to end this challeng at 10 locat we know there more out there ie nanay gloria red ribbon dts etc  mayb part 2 of this challeng is in the futur mayb not  one thing for sure were both readi to get back to eat clean and train mean  this halohalo challeng was a great way for me to decompress from all that damn grill chicken breast

aft read my review general manag timm respond with veri apologet email  he acknowledg that all part of the servic i receiv was abysm and that valentino doe not stand by such behavior  he and the onsit execut chef want to extend their apolog and would like to have jim g and i back to make it up to us

plus i had titti on the brain and there werent ani here be jiggl around  i mean there were but it would have been inappropri for me to be see those titti wherea titti at anoth locat would be fine sinc they were be shown for money and allthey got all your necessities

 a screen that tell you which cashier is avail to go towhich was wrong 

tell me go to cashier number 3 when there still a ladi there tri someth new the bf and i discov magura a bulgarian restaur that been around for about six year 

pull into the park lot you notic the magura pizza sign first then realiz there a magura restaur next door  walk through the front door you see red curtain block the view of entir restaur  the scent of a meat deli hit me first 

the waitress ask if she can help us and we tell her two for dinner  as we pick our seat there one to two parti also dine on this saturday earli even  on the video screen are bulgarian music video  

perus their long extens menu it hard what to decid on  you can choos among their soup like tripe soup cold appet like kashkav aka yellow chees regular appet like chicken liver salad like shopska egg dish like mish mash grill like kiufleta entre like pork kavarma pizza like shrimp alexand and dessert like tiramisu  be adventur we opt for about five  dish 

they start you off with hot bread that toast nice  the first dish to arriv was the tarat cold cucumb and yogurt soup with dill 395  this was a huge order plenti for two peopl  it was refresh for a hot day but a bit too much  next to arriv was the stuf red pepper roast sweet red pepper stuf with bulgarian feta chees and fresh spice 725  present it look like someth was miss on our plate  the three pepper were veri tasti though and was the highlight of our meal  our third dish was the filet which was thin slice of meat 650  this was pretti disappoint as it just tast like ham noth special  fourth to come was the chees shopski style 595  on top laid a fri egg that you mix in with the chees  it a heavi dish that goe better with some bread  last to arriv was the kebapcheta grill bulgarian spice sausag 825  it came with a bean salad a potato salad and a tomato sauc for dip  the sausag were a bit dri and disappoint finish to our dinner

servic was okay my water was never refil and the glass was actual taken away while the bf was still finish his bulgarian beer zagorka 350 which he said tast like a budweis  it took forev for our bill to come despit the waitress ask if were want anyth els and us say no  

overal the food was okay  the bf and i agre that we can say we at least tri it but it wasnt someth we would be crave for anytim soon it a hit and miss with certain dish but i guess it worth check out if youv never had bulgarian before

tot bill includ tip and tax 4400

you can see photo of all the food we ate up abovthe grill sea bass was delici albeit overpr  the har gow was okay and so was the shu mai

w also order the sushi roll which was also over price  it wasnt fresh although it had a good flavor to it  servic was exceli stop in here for a sweet fix when my rw select last night didnt have dessert  i had just enough time befor the jackson show to have an ice cream sandwich  when i ask the young thing behind the counter what flavor they had she explain you pick ani two cooki you want and ani of their ice creams

i chose a snickerdoodl and a smore cooki and the ice cream i chose was cooki dough  that one from each of my 3 food group  she place one cooki on a wooden thing put a larg scoop of ice cream on the cooki push it down to even out the fill and then she place the other cooki on top

sh place the ice cream sandwich in a cardboard ice cream cup and place a spoon in the cup with the cooki and ice cream

th dessert is a bit pricey and sit on a cushion bench in the miracl mile shop is not a classi eat experi  i knew that in advanc so that ok  the ice cream and the cooki were good it is what it is kitschi  while buca di beppo has the market on that keyword there someth nostalg about come to the real mccoy

it not realli a hole in the wall  it pretti larg with vari room  a block off the strip it great for a larg parti gettogeth wed rehears sweet 16 etc becaus it wont set you back  reason price huge food and somewhat delish

speci rule the nest but there is a 25 item list will get your mouth water  slurp

it funthe sooner you know the gimmick  premis that is benihana the more toler it will be no one in their right mind would ever come here for authent japanes cuisin but like ani cheesi realiti show it all about the experi it is aliv and well for the now las vega hotel formal hilton establish with full on display of in your face cook and aweinspir food play 1 

for those not in the know benihana is a chain of faux japanes stirfri where folk sit around a giant grill where a chef cook the meal in front of the guest serv it fresh off the grill due to a height in popular and a lack of japanes us peopl it usual a nonjapanes person do the cook one thing differ about this benihana is lvhs abil to slot in actual japanes peopl or asian actor with an imposs good japanes accent either way it keep the facad go and the custom happi 2

from the tacki japanes decor that make me feel like im on a boat to the wait staff dress in what appear to be uncomfort kimono it baffl me how this is consid a fine dine restaur for casino standard the price certain match it most of the hibachi grill meat will run anyon from 2332 throw in seafood and the price near doubl you know your an expens place when the cheapest thing offer on the menu are sushi roll 812 along with dessert

th food isnt a total fail but it far from a total win sad overpr it the realiti of most casino establish ani way when in vega tri to let someon who had a good day in the casino take the bill or get it compd off i think benihana work best as a general group dine restaur one where the experi will like trump the food

1 not to mention smelli cloth and a potenti food porn greas facial
2 i still feel bad for the guy behind the grillok it benihana so you know what to expect im not a huge fan of teppanyaki general but my fella happen to love it and when i mention that benihana offer a 30 birthday coupon he told me to sign him up and what my babi want my babi get 

we came here the even befor his birthday and they took our pictur and print it out for us as a birthday present we were seat quick and luckili the place was pretti busi for a tuesday so we didnt have to wait long to get the show on the road my fella got the steak and shrimp and i opt for the spici chicken hibachi the price are much higher than most other teppanyaki place you cant find anyth for less than 25 and most are around 40 if you want anyth includ steak fri rice is also extra 

our chef was friend but it hard not to notic that pretti much everyth he said was script the chef behind him was about 15 minut behind our tabl and i heard everyth our chef said repeat by the other chef it was still fun and entertain but ive seen better the food was just ok as well the steak was a littl overcook and underseason but still tasti my chicken was nice and spici which i enjoy quit a bit 

they brought out ice cream to everyon at our tabl well everyon but me sinc they forgot mine but sinc i didnt realli like the ice cream i tast from my fella dish i didnt bother ask for one for myself they even includ whip cream chocol sauc and a candl for all the peopl celebr birthdays

overal it worth a visit if you have your birthday coupon but there are plenti of other teppanyaki place that are better and cheaper in town if you dont we spent about an hourtwenti here  so im told

this could easili be remedi with a chalkboard or even a maintain signup sheet on a clipboard where past singer name are check off as they sing is the concept revolutionari heck no but it work even at the crummiest karaok bar that ive been to two hour and six cocktail later and i still didnt get a shot at stardom at elli island three star earn for an overal great crowdwhen i think of place to stay in vega i rare think of the riviera first i like to stay closer to the center of the strip in fact when i stay anywher north of the venetian i am alway afraid that a giant wreck ball might reduc my room to rubbl in the middl of the night realli 24 room great deal id like a room with a vi   crunch smash kaboom frank i am surpris the riviera is still stand 

i book a packag through us airway which includ a round trip flight fromto sfo and 2 night at this beauti hotel for 230 all tax includ wreck ball be damn it a deal sure i had to rent a car to drive around but it was still worth it 

the riviera is a live breath testament to the allimport say dont judg a book by it cover from the outsid it look like a dilapid outdat monstros on the insid it look like a good valu hotel on the strip 

i stay at the monaco tower which is the tall tower behind the main hotel i was veri surpris to see that the room were newli remodel they seem more modern than room in more luxuri hotel each room featur an ihom clock radio with an ipod dock and a 42 flat screen tv how about that i kept think am i at the right place last time i stay at the riviera was 25 year ago here the main differ in 2006 my main concern was will my toilet overflow and flood the room with youknowwhat in 2009 my main concern was should i wake up to the backstreet boy best hit or new kid on the block most success album quit an improv 

now for the bad part this goe out to the peopl who occupi room 6244 on februari 14 and februari 15 you see i had the misfortun of stay in room 6242 which is adjac to room 6244 in fact our room had a door that if need be could combin the two room into one awkward 2room suit the presenc of said door made paperthin wall even less soundproof 

so    thank you annoy filipino famili for talk loud for yell at each other until 4 am and for bring a scream toddler to vega with you what was he do up at 4 am what was he do in vega and whi wasnt he sedated

thank you two loudmouth twentysometh coupl for yell and describ your club experi at 430 am the next day whi were you stay in the same room shouldnt you have stay in separ room and  umm  spend qualiti time with one anoth good thing you were too drunk to stay awak and make nois for more than 20 minut i was go to steal your do not disturb sign so that an anxious housekeep would wake you up at 9 am but you forgot to hang it on your doorknob in the first place i guess the joke still on you 

valet park at the riviera is awesom it fill up fast but if your a guest it doesnt matter they retriev your car in a matter of second and i still dont understand how they do it cab are harder to come by and the line are usual long if you stay here design a driver and rent a carmy father recent roll into town and i ask where he was stay when he answer the riviera i got realli snobbi and was like ew then i paus to think when was the last time i was in the riviera it could easili have been a decade

when i arriv i felt more like i was in a downtown casino the riviera still has that old vega flare it was old reek of stale cigarett but there were portrait with date and famous peopl elvi and the like and you rememb this is where the star came this is vega as they knew it and love it

when we arriv to his room i was surpris at how clean and updat the accommod were flat screen tvs this was no motel 6 the room was clean and neat and didnt have that damp nasti hote smell that one might experi say at the el cortez

ther realli noth that draw one to the riviera it an outdat proper that lack a nightclub or coolhiptrendi loungerestaur they have a comedi club local onli pay 10 a few restaur and just a littl pizzazz the riviera is aok and true gem in my bookhow do they stay open

loc in the back of the sahara hotel and casino one has to wonder when they get busi here

tri to grab a quick bite befor our show on a weekday afternoon onli a hand of parti were present  

standard cafe fare like burger pizza salad etc  

we got the spinach  artichok dip a creami cheesi blend of artichok heart spinach onion parmesan a hint of bacon and tortilla chip  serv in a sourdough bowl for 725 and the nascar burger a classic black angus 10 oz juici flamebroil burger for 925

first off the spinach  artichok dip were tasti but too small of a portion for the price  and i wasnt too fond of the soft sourdough bowl  what up with soft bread  on the menu it say place in the center of the tabl and dive in  well it definit not big enough to share

w ask for the burger to be medium well but it came out more well done  there a problem when you cant even get the burger right  it had a decent flavor it in though and it was also on a soft bun too  the fri had a deep color that remind me of arbi cur fri but without the season  

servic was a bit slow not on our waitresss part but on how long it took for the food to come out  were they kill the cow in the back  the place need some better light mayb they are tri to save on the electr bill becaus i found it to be too dark for my tast dure the day

overal spend your money elsewher  when your hungri on the strip dont get suck into bad casino cafe cuz youll feel even more rip off

25 stars

pic of our lunch postafter watch the warrior game at the terribl casino and still be earli ive decid to drive straight down paradis blvd and check out the other casino that is locat at the tailend of the strip and onli 10 minut away from the terribl casino and my room at the platinum hotel 

after induc a larg amount of cloud of secondhand smoke i was a littl hungri and decid to check out the nascar cafe insid the sahara hotel and casino 

the gift shop is locat next to the restaur and bar also display of nascar memorablia showcas on the lobbi includ my pose with the late dale earnhardt 3 mr goodwrench car you can tell las vega is big on nascar 

i was sit at the bar while read the menu and refresh my memori on a past episod from the man v food the restaur is best known for their b3 burrito a 6lb 24 in burrito but sinc it was late at night i couldnt do it 

so i order the fish and chip for 1000 the dish has four halibutfillet batter with beer and cook to a golden brown with a side of cur fri noth too fanci about the fish dish  i also had two cranberri and vodka drink for 800 each the price of the cocktail seem question i hope the bartend use good vodka for my drink 

the bar also have a special on a 144 oz pitcher of beer start at 2000 for domest beer and more for import with a huge select of beer i might tri that one day to along with that b3 burrito in which mani of you are disappoint that i didnt tri 

this review is incomplet until i tri that huge burritoit is complet unjustifi to charg 12 a pound for mms but where els can you get all 22 color of mms be cheap like me and onli let a small amount of the 22 color mix into the bag youll get all 22 color and will cost you a lot less they also sell mms premium which are ok but way overpr at 4 a box  if you have kid check out the 3d movi on the 3rd floor the kid will like it and you will like it becaus it is free 

unless you are obsess with mms and want to buy mm tshirt mug cloth dishwar etc there realli isnt much els to do hereif you can imagin it it here with an mm logo or charact stamp on it

thi is commerci crank to 11 see consumer go overboard repuls me somewhat i mean i love mms but this was just too much while i thought it was cool to see the candi section fill with mms of dozen of unusu color i couldnt get past the fact that they were price far higher than a bag you could pick up at ani groceri store differ mm color arent worth a higher price in my opinion

tourist price for a touristi store but from the crowd that jam into this multilevel structur it is obvious that peopl love spend their money on stuff cover with mm commerci brandmultipl floor of everyth mms 

they have made this candi into an empir with it funni charact and commerci mms world take advantag of that popular and commerci the heck out of it at this store hey we all love mms so who am i to judg as everytim i have been here i walk out with a big bag of mix color chocolates

pretti much everyth under the sun mm relat here  shirt toy hat key chain collect stuff etc and a lot of memorabilia to look at too of cours there is a monster wall of mms chocol in differ color to choos from mix and match some color you just cant get anywher els 

free short 3d movi is cool on the upper floor is pretti cool take a few cheesi pic with the peopl dress as mms 

worth a trip but as with all the touristi spot on the strip it can get a bit pricey unless your a huge mms fan just go for the chocol and skip all the other stuffcontact meat sweat  

urban dictionari describ meat sweat as  to consum an obsen amount of meat result in perfus sweating

i got the meat sweat just watch an insan amount of meat be consum  one king cut prime rib about the size of a small dinosaur land with a thud on our tabl  it was then i understood whi my friend didnt order ani side  this steak was  go to be a challeng  

anoth challeng unfortun was understand the price tag  i get it  fine dine atmospher dri age beef and fresh seafood  to me it was a fluf up steakhous  not bad but not outstand enough to shell out that kind of dough again  

locat insid the new york new york hotel and casino right near the main entranc  the restaur is complet open face the commot of the casino passer by  the bar wrap around so you can have a drink while wait for a tabl  it decor with photo of famous new york alumni cover the wall  you can take a look at the steak they use in a window outsid dri age under bright light  look like someth out of dexter  we made an open tabl reserv and we were seat right on time  it took a few minut to be acknowledg after we sat down but our waiter was pleasant and fun onc he arriv  

i order the filet and my boyfriend order the dri age new york sirloin  both our steak were the wrong temperatur  i dont normal eat meat so an under cook steak is cringeworthi to me  i tough through it becaus we need to be at a concert  the soup i order was a beer chees soup and it was probabl the highlight of my meal along with the side of mushroom i order  the asparagus tast like pure butter and they were cold  then a famili sat down next to us and we watch a littl kid eat a filet with ketchup oh boy  it was cute that the waiter cut the steak for him though

man vs food challeng  food win  defeat my friend geno but made a homeless man on the bridg grin from ear to ear  he was eat good that nightgift certif often take me place i dont normal go this is the case for my most recent visit to pf chang i have been on a number of occas when i work near one year ago and they had pretti reason price lunch 

i rememb that i alway enjoy the garlic noodl so i knew this was a must on our most recent visit we also got some spici chicken eggplant garlic spinach and fri rice the food was ok and my memori hadnt fail me the garlic noodl were again my favorit dish the chicken and eggplant were entir too sweet for my tast the fri rice was ok and so was the spinach but i was hope for more garlic flavor i wish i onli order the garlic noodl and if i ever come again which isnt like i would stick with them again 

servic was ok our server was attent at first but when a larg parti came in refil becam a littl more infrequ he apolog and tri to be as attent as possibl which we appreci 

overal it a chain so they are all pretti standard and this one doesnt stand out in ani way either negat or positbreakfast here is aok and prop to them for still serv eggi at 2pm the prefect time for a vega breakfast  it a simpl place small oyster bar insid and a dozen or so tabl for dine al fresco there no way your forget your still insid the breakfast menu was simpl enough  omelet a bagel sammi pancak  noth out of the ordinari my omelet the vega was fill with a few veggi some avocado cheddar and bacon all super at soak up the booz from the prior even the mimosa are 5 if you need to crush that hangov and are standard size but tasti overal a solid breakfast in a creepi ph mall area standard vega morn 

pro tip plan on drink mass quantiti the barrestaur direct across from it seem to have an all day happi hour go onlife could be funni one hour i am eat at the bottom of the restaur totem pole in sam club and a few hour later i am eat at the top of the restaur totem pole in the steak hous in circuscircus life could be unfunni after 22 year i was see my estrang aunt for the first time and learn about one star circumst that happen on my mother side of the famili to put it nice i was veri relax befor the meal and will probabl be write a review on todd english pub in the near future

  the steak hous is in circuscircus this is an out of the way locat if you are in the middl of the las vega strip if you are drive the traffic could be heavi and the cab ride could be pricey owe to the fact that my aunt was stay in the aria the steak hous was not my first choic i would have gone for ruth chriss steak hous or someplac like bubba gump howev my aunt heard great thing about the steak hous and realli want to eat there she did have a valid point the steak hous claim in their web site to have been vote best of las vega for over 20 year and was name zagat 2011 top steak hous in las vegas

 my first impress of the steak hous is that it is extraordinari fanci it is the antithesi of circuscircus the light was just right the décor was extraordinari eleg and up to the time that the waiter never gave back the chang the servic was commendable

  my aunt brother and i took advantag of the 31 petit filet mignon special suppos it is avail throughout the month of june the petit filet mignon special start out with fresh bake bread my tast bud great enjoy it i chose hous salad with ranch dress over black bean soup my tast bud also great appreci it the petit filet mignon special came with chef fresh veget which was a bowl of green stuff that i did not touch from a choic of mash potato bake potato or wild rice blend i chose the wild rice blend my tast bud great appreci the petit filet mignon at the same time that 1 they would have appreci a bigger serv and 2 they experienc better steak at some other steak hous the soda or pop tast bland the realiti was that the dine environ ad to the tast of the food it was a dine environ ideal  for famili member estrang after 22 year to catch up as for the food if i were to be given a blind tast test between their steak or ruth chris in a diner for exampl i think it would be veri close i learn that in dine a lot of the experi is the dine environ of the restaurant

 life is funni i learn that i enjoy casual dine food as much as eleg dine food  in my opinion the dine environ in the steak hous might be better than steak in casual dine restaur when the food is just the same 
  

the daniel s yelp 100 challeng review 89if this was the first balla steakhous i had ever been to i would have been impressed

th tabl was readi after a brief minut  all the staff were friend and help  one guy point me to the restroom which is somewhat hard to find the guy in the can itself was cool and the waiter put up veri well with the complet nonsens from our resid smartass in our group even though he was wear a basebal hat to a dressi restaurant

overal ambienc is great if you like old school style steakhous stuff you would expect in chicago or new york mafia type place  i like how the restaur is section off into differ room so the place doe not get too loud a real problem at fleme newport beach and manhattan beach

win select  you can spend as much as you want here  you could spend the gdp of a small countri  i would say the by the glass select was smallish and was not too impress on the bargain end of the menu  i am sure that you could find a good bottl or two if you know your wine but i am not that good  my impress is that it is overpr for the qualiti of wine 

food  ribey steak are what you would expect from a good restaur  howev if you are not from la you will think that your steak is overdon with respect to how you order it  i like mine medium rare but it was a bit closer to medium  it was still pretti decent with the foie gras infus sauc  the side were accept but not that impress  we had mac and chees seem a bit too al dent broccoli a bit over steam and saute mushroom good but i could actual replic veri easili at home  we didnt have dessert becaus it was most dudes

sinc the websit wont tell you the price i will give you an idea i have to go on memori sinc it was host dinner  thank host

ribey 16 oz  40
ribey bone in 22 oz 50
carpetbagg ribey 10oz 30
wine pinot from argentina i forgot the name maddera 90 a bottle
penfold cab dont ask me the vintag  10 a glass
silv oak alexand valley 98 i think 40 a glass
most wine by the glass were 15
wedg salad 10
most appet other than market price stuff were about 10  15

anyway it realli depend on what you are look for and what your expect are  if you are from new york and you have been to the top steakhous you will hate this place and knock over a tabl  but if you are from la you might feel right at home

i am from la but i appreci how the old school steakhous of new york and chicago roll  i went to jack rose in new york and smith and wollenski in chicago  they definit are not shi about give you a slight sear hunk of prime beef  my kind of style  besid i have had raw beef hors liver fish and egg so realli it no big deal to me

a few of other note  it is pretti good to go in group we had 8 and they had a nice larg tabl we could all sit at instead of push tabl togeth  the restaur pretti much clear out around 1030pm or so we had 9pm reserv the place was pretti busi when we first got there  if you want a quieter even go for a veri late dinner  be paitent if you are cab it over here  it took a bit for cab to arriv even though we told them a few minut befor we left  just have a stogi or whatev and hope it isnt the middl of the winter or summer so you arent freez or boili definit have issu do dinner at an indian restaur that doe a lunch buffet  it doesnt make total sens but i usual prefer origin india just for that reason  but it was late we had the crave and my wife had a great experi lunch buffet the last time she was here so we gave it a go  

the place was still full of peopl at 9pm so that was a plus  i was excit to see dosa on the menu but the waiter told me their grill wasnt on and it would take at least 30 minut to get readi  ok nevermind  there a free mango lassi with a yelp check in  he tell us it onli good for one lassi per tabl  fine

w unintent went vegetarian for the even  my wife alway get the saag paneer extra spici and i went with the matar paneer  both dish were veri good  the pea in my matar paneer were super sweet  mayb the sweetest pea ive ever had  i devour them  the naan was pretti good but the aloo paratha wasnt worth the extra 150  

ill be back to tri the lunch buffet but i think i am done with dinner here  use the yelp dealchiploplo chipoodl chipotopolay

look for a preshow meal we saw the nearbi choic of amcdonald bpanda express or cchipotl  consid i dont like mcdonald panda express is on my usual restaur rotat  i havent had chipotl in a few year the time was ripe to give chipotl anoth go

mi choic  the barbacoa bowl  

mi 2 cent  it washow do i put this  bore  bore like the scene in ferri beuller day off where ben stein is go anyon  anyon beullerbeul  bore like have a cspan view parti on valentin day  noth say sexytim than senat hear in hdp

now it wasnt bad per se  it just as i get older i want my tastebud to be titil  i just said titil giggl  the portion were good  the price was reason  also kudo to the staff for effici move the big las vega line along  wait was minim  to me id rather go to a local taqueria for some authent and cheap fare wo the line of hipster belieb and twihard  

chipotl is situat in a primo locat to lure in the tourist  the restaur was clean and the staff know how to handl the crowd come in for susten like me  

chipotl has it fan and more power to them for like what they like  i may return if im walk by the next time im in vega  it conveni and the price are reason consid the dine option in the casinos

nomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomnomomalso not far my hotel i start my earli morn at this hotelcasino and play a coupl 2500 hand of blackjack and i won both hand too with the dealer went over 21 whoohoo

with those two win hand i wise and quiet left the blackjack tabl as a winner so i reward myself with a cup of coffe and breakfast at the starbuck locat on the same casino level 

i order a grand coffe with an addshot and a blueberri muffin total 925 

man where are we at the airport that is one pricey trip to starbuck at least it free thank to my prior win at the blackjack tablwe book this hotel via pricelin name your own price deal so we didnt exact select this hotel  if youv never util this featur you dont know which hotel your book until your price is accept  the nice thing is that you can set guidelin  we specif note a 4star hotel and win this vicin of the strip  i would not rate this hotel 4 star mayb 35 but definit not 4

4 night  99 per night dure a busi convent week  wed to sun
daili resort fee  950

the best perk of this hotel is their daili happi hour  mixer event  it is free and all guest are welcom to attend  what includ appet beer wine water and soda  the chees platter  fruit were my favorit  the second best perk is the starbuck locat insid the hotel

th room was spacious clean and surpris look much nicer than more expens hotel on the strip ie pari luxor mont carlo etc

th locat is conveni for those who want to stay veri close to the strip but away from the hustl  bustl howev the cab were lack  you have a better shot flag a cab at balli across the street

i wouldnt mind stay here again but it isnt at the top of my list  ideal hotel for busi trip not for leisurwhat was onc known as the maxim the westin casuarina is a decent midlevel hotel option  sheraton pump some money to remodel the room and properti a few year back which it bad needed

th hotel feel more like a busi hotel than a vega casino hotel  there a small casino on properti and a few restaur  the restaur are not much to write home about

when a friend of mine stay in the hotel a coupl of week ago i stop by to check out the roomit not bad a solid 3 star  he like it becaus it was offstrip and the price was right69 a night  of cours rate vari but it was good for that time

overal not a bad offstrip option

return factor  60well the atmospher is fun i enjoy the fake foliag fake anim fake thunderstorm and fake natur nois i didnt care much for the fake friendli of our server though you can tell when someon is complet fake it

aft a tedious 40 minut wait make reserv to avoid that we were seat eventu the hostess was confus and we went for a tour of the restaur after wind our way through tabl for awhil she final stop and call on her headset for help a minut later she final got us to a tabl 

i order a bacon cheeseburg from fakehappywait the burger was order medium but receiv well done  it was an averag burger despit be dry

it wasnt aw but not worth a wait nor the pricemy take on quantiti vs quality

wait how was your sirloin steak

archi terribl it was overcook and dry

wait i am sorri how about i make it up to you by bring you 10 more just like it

archi i dunno

wait how about 12 more

archi deal


in todai defens it is pretti decent for all you can eat  

sure the pile of rice under the nigiri are like mini footbal design to fill you up fast

sur you gotta beat down six group of famili just to get to the crab legs

but all in all not bad if you are hungov and starv which odd i tend to be when in vegas

cattlwow this restaur did not live up to my expect at all i was realli disappoint with the food for the price 

on the last night of a recent vega trip with just ladi we want to go out with a classi bang earlier in the year i visit the ramsey steakhous which is also locat in the pari hotelcasino that was my first pick but sinc we couldnt get a tabl there eiffel was our backup plan 

we had a reserv for 4 and arriv about 20 minut earli they accommod us right away which was great the view of the strip is a beauti backdrop to the restaur 

our server was excel he was veri profession and explain everyth in detail 

i order the surf and turf 74 it was a prime cut steak with lobster i was extrem extrem disappoint with my meal it was a layer meal which consist of a block of a bland potato dish top with the steak top with a lobster cake then top with 2 tini piec of lobster and garnish httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosselectgyf9evsqv2gqb4dms6lwuseridq2rsdohzscbif1oope6lg  not at all what i had in mind i couldnt help but compar this to gordon ramsay eiffel tower restaur doesnt come close to ramsay 

in lieu of a salad i opt for the tomato mozzarella and basil app 18 httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosselectehcfescdne6edlbmfv77oauseridq2rsdohzscbif1oope6lg that was delish it is heirloom tomato avocado with fresh mozzarella chees dress with a basil oil i ate this with assort bread they give speak of bread you get it onli after you put in your order there is a man who walk around with a platter of assort bread tabletot cant they just leav a bread basket dont want that man to judg me on my bread consumpt ha ha

th steak was good but noth mind blow side were ok my friend order the halibut and onli ate about half sinc she didnt realli like the flavor 

im glad i can say ive tri this place but probabl wouldnt ever come back nor recommend to otherthree star for a great bar 
negat two for dinner servic that blew

hubbi and i made reserv for our dinner here a day earli we drool over the menu and call his parent for suggest on what to eat

th follow day was spent walk around vega drink and eat we unfortun plan veri poor and had book two other thing this day a late lunch and bar show at kahunavill prepaid on groupon and a naughti xburlesqu show to end the night  a 730 dinner was stuck right in between the two with not much room on either side 

we arriv on time and were told to wait at the bar where we order a drink from keith we actual each order a bottl of hell keep 2270 and he suggest we share the beer becaus the bottl was a littl bigger than normal and we didnt have a long wait perfect  and yummy

with sad we look over our menus and realiz wed have to get someth smaller than we plan sinc wed eaten not long befor and had to hustl a littl for the 10 pm show we were told to be there no later than 9  we want to be upfront with our server and told him we would be order app and dessert instead of complet entre sinc we were at a window seat he said that we would probabl have to move to anoth tabl near the bar i understood sinc seat is the nicest so they want to give it to the peopl spend the most but the way he said it was not pleasant even though we were allow to stay in the seat his attitud the entir meal left a bad tast 

what we ordered
warm caesar salad 1600
blue chees souffl 1600
creme brule 1200

we both agre the salad was the best of the three the dress was fantast the souffl wasnt bad either but we found a much better creme brule anoth night at centercut in flamingo  honest we realli enjoy the view and the water show from bellagio but when im spend 50 on an appet and dessert id like some class from the staff we should have just move to the bar area as soon as he first said itsiam garden is in a slight sketchi area how do i know this becaus the vagrant that wander into the path of a dump truck bring it to a screech halt while i was wait to turn told me through the acrid smoki cloud roll off the tire of the truck becaus the sign on the cstore on the corner proclaim it with it broken marque read someth like op and b becaus the secur gate doorway and litter strewn lot next door quiet whisper sketchi in my ear as i pull in the lot 

i decid to give them a shot i was hope becaus when i call to verifi the locat and make sure they were still in busi the woman who answer the phone did not speak english 

there is essenti no ambianc here it move to henderson sever year ago i was the onli custom servic was fast it was almost like they were wait for me or someon like me 

i start with thai tea which was suffici tasti the menu is pretti simpl with most thai dish and a smatter of popular american chines dish like orang chicken 

i order chicken red curri hot i have not been satisfi with the heat of the curri i have had late so i step up to hot the dish came up quick the curri sauc had a coconut milk base but was more wateri and less sweet than mani i have had not a bad thing it had an atyp assort of veggi okra some sort of small green squash red pepper green pepper and some veget that i ask them to identifi but have forgotten the name of alreadi and bay leav the chicken was white meat plenti and tender get an addit order of rice and this dish is enough for 2 peopl for 699 in fact my total includ the tea was about 925

a decent and servic hole in the wall thai place

great servic and huge portion but dont expect restaur style foodwe stop here for someth differ  i had look at the menu onlin and decid on the kebab trioa dinner with koobideh chicken and lamb kebab  serv with the meal are vermicelli pilaf basmati rice a hous salad and grill tomato and red pepper

i start my meal with a cup of their summer soup avail for a limit time  it a cucumb yogurt cold soup with walnut piec and golden raisin for a touch of sweet  the soup was top with some crouton and garnish with a sprig of mint  it was excel  veri differ and veri refreshing

for the main cours the kebab trio was perfect for the two of us  my wife doe not like lamb  by share the trio i was abl to have some lamb while she stuck with chicken and koobideh  of the three the koobideh was the star of the dish  the lamb was cook too muchi had request rare and it was more on the medium side  it was also a bit tough  the chicken was ok but there wasnt much spice to it  the koobideh on the other hand was done medium rare as i ask and it was flavor and veri enjoyable

for dessert my wife got the rice pud it was veri good and i got an order of baklavaalso veri good

servic was not the best  we wait at the podium for about 5 minut befor anyon came to seat us  my ice tea wasnt refil in a time manner and even though there were onli a few other diner in the room our server seem to disappear for long period of time onli check back with us onc near the end of our dinner  i also thought it was a bit tacki to take the dessert order enter it into a nearbi termin and then put the bill on the tabl befor clear the dish and well befor dessert was brought  bad form

if i decid to come back it will be for takeout but with other choic in the area for mediterranean food i probabl will go elsewheranoth lodg in vega  at least you know what your go to get when you walk into these chain of lodges

i had the grill chicken  avocado sandwich marin grill chicken breast fresh avocado swiss chees appl wood bacon red onion tomato and sprout  serv with mayo on a fresh bake roll 895 for lunch  it serv with your choic of fri onion ring cole slaw or side salad  i went for the side salad and alway appreci when it a decent side salad  i tri this sandwich at the other lodg and appreci the marin moist chicken  the appl wood bacon realli make this sandwich though

th husband tri their quesadilla with season tritip  stuf with cheddarjack chees green chilli and your choic of chicken or season tritip  serv with sour cream and salsa 895  you can also get this with chicken  he tri their tritip in the sandwich form and want a bit of variat  

overal food was decent and servic was fine  they have special go on so it worth check out their daili boardsome friend were in town and they want to tri a new restaur we stumbl upon this place and notic it was vote best of las vega in 2004 and 2007 how can you go wrong with that we walk in and prompt get seat i dont recal anyth out of the ordinari in regard to the middl eastern ambienc on to the menu we give it a look over and befor we can even order they give us some complimentari ftayir which is lebanes bread it was warm and tasty

our parti order the following

most popular dish  frarej  half of a chicken bake with potato and ripe tomato bake togeth so that the juic and flavor from the chicken and veget permeat each other bast until golden with oliv oil garlic and lemon juice

shawarma plate  beef grill with tomato and season onion and serv with lebanes tarat sauc and a generous bowl of lebanes rice

shish kabob combo  lamb shrimp beef kabob tender and succul cube and charbroil with fresh season veget laid on a bed of lebanes rice top with season onions

th best out of the three was definit the beef shawarma plate the chicken seem a littl dri and the shish kabob combo was good but not excellent

il answer my two favorit food question which i alway ask

would you order that dish again yes shawarma excellent
would you eat here again maybey it not on my top 20 place to eat when were throw restaur name around but if someon els want to eat here i would probabl go with them

and of cours i ad some pictur to stimul your tast sensthis was my first time here and return were mix  when we arriv at about 10 at night the outsid was dark and forebod on the extrem edg of a strip mall on charleston  the insid too was dark with high and low wooden tabl some cushion bench and oak seat and a rustic mountain lodg ambianc  while a sizabl number of tabl were spread about the focal point of the room was the larg bar  it is a video poker bar in the main but when i call to ask what hour food was serv i was told 247  and i am alway look for place that serv good hearti food past 900 pm becaus for one reason or anoth dinner for me and my mate is often defer beyond that witch hour  so i was still game to tri this place

french onion soup was hot and good but not great  a veri thick coat of swiss chees had most melt but not brown on top of the crock and the broth and caramel onion were tasti but these three element did not total merg and harmon until i stir thing up a bit with my soup spoon  while i enjoy the tast of the soup look at it crown of rippl clot chees all i could think of was cholesterol and clog arteries

dian did not like her clam chowder but base on her sensit palat that would be true of ani dish that contain ani spice other than a littl salt  so i got to eat a crock of clam chowder minus one spoon too  and while the chowder was spici i found it to be so in a good way  it contain celeri and lot of clam was more brown than white in appear and is what i refer to as rough chowdah  i like it better than i did the onion soup  

larg heavili batter onion ring were veri good  the batter was light and the string of onion insid veri heat hot  dip in ketchup the ore were a hit for me  but what i like best dure this latenight dinner was the turkey club sandwich  it was compos of more toothpick slice of light toast and mayonnais sourdough bread than i care to count veri tasti thin slice ham moist turkey veri good applewood smoke bacon lettuc and chop tomato  all of the ingredi were fresh and of veri good qualiti and the assembl multideck sandwich was so high that i could bare get my mouth around each skyscrap half  but i just manag to do so  each massiv bite tast veri good as did the shoestr fri that accompani this delici club sandwich  ala i cannot say the same about the rather dead noncreami coleslaw i also sampl  and although noth was wrong with them i did not like dian thick lodg fri near as much as my shoestrings

servic was veri good and friend  but when my chang was return after produc a 35 groupon and a twenti dollar bill on a total tab of 3784 i receiv exact 17 back in bill and no coin in chang  so i was short 16 cent  i said noth as i would have given those coin back as part of the tip anyway  but i felt that this should have been my choicenot the serveri havent been here in a realli long time but my og ryan b came to meet me for lunch and we decid to tri memphi championship i have never been a big fan of this place or even bbq in general the servic was realli spotti today it took quit some time for someon to come take our drink order and then anoth long wait to place our order our server was friend but anoth server had to keep check on us sinc she notic that we were wait long period of time without be wait on

i decid on the king lunch and my lunch date order the bbq burger she kept forget what he want and came back twice to check with him at that point just write it down if you cant rememb 

final our food came out after near 30 minut and by that time i was in a rush to get back to work i ask for the check immedi when our food came out we rush through our food and i was happili back at work in time but the slow servic almost did me in so i might have to steer clear from them when im in a rush otherwis the food was good and i enjoy the cream corn and their bbq sauc quit a bit the price are realli great for lunch tooi alway tri to hit up place i havnt been to so this was a random stop also tri to reserv judgement until i am complet done with my experi and onli take a quick glanc at the rate becaus when you check in you cant help but notic it

so i walk in and look over my option their theme here is chinesethai fusion i see that they have lunch special which is alway good for peep like me who appreci decent food at decent price if you refer to my pic the lunch special are from open to 4 pm everyday choos an item from the list along with either lo mein steam rice or fri rice you also have an extra side option from a veget egg roll cream chees won ton or soup egg drop hot n sour or won ton

i went with the orang chicken typic right fri rice and hot n sour soup from the 575 list keep in mind a drink is not includ but i got water and it was definit from their tap

first off i gotta say that the hot n sour soup was excel not too salti or bland and enough ingredi to round out the tast it was steam hot

a for the entre the orang chicken was crispi and the orang tang to it was good onli thing i notic was that some of content could of been more consist meat portion instead of extra batter

now for the fri rice wow no not the good kind of wow the what the heck just happen wow the fri rice was not the typic fri rice i was use to there was like noth in it you know like pea carrot onion etc it seem like they put a coupl drop of soy sauc and mix in a quarter of an egg it didnt have much flavor to it 

total i paid was 620 includ tax i left a dollar tip on the tabl for the servic was ok   if it wasnt for the hot n sour soup be so good this would of easili been 2 star at least the the abov mention was edibl mayb next time i will just go with a larg bowl of soup either that or risk tri anoth entre in hope that the cook was just have a bad day at the time either way i will updat accordingly

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 9824 hour 

servic was horribl but whaddaya expect at 2am 

i cant believ all the year live on the east coast i never tri a nathan hot dog  it like never tri a mcdonald quarter pounder until you are in your 30s  it that stupid but i digress  i was pleasant surpris by how yummi this hot dog was and this is come from a hot dog antagonist

loc insid luxor on the 2nd floor to the left of mcdonaldwhile at the confer this was a conveni place to meet for lunch

th food is ok the drink are ok  but noth special

if you ask for water they charg 50 cent a glass we were surpriseat at border grill while in las vega seem to be a choic center more around necess than the desir to eat there oh stripsteak is full up for the night you mean i cant get a tabl at fleur de lys well i dont want to eat at the buffet againscrew it let go to border grill 

it is not that the food is bad or the decor lack it just well ordinari the price are vega pricesno not 599 prime rib vega price more like 23 fish taco vega price not exact the best valu for a quick and casual sit down dine experi 

we decid to come here becaus well we had reserv at aureol that we miss becaus i unfortun had to keep work about 2 hour past the time i was set to take a dinner break so what was a 25 hour dinner break turn into about 40 minut to eat someth fast sinc this locat is close to the convent center at mandalay bay and they have an area in the bar where you can eat quick we settl on this

th food was good but not great thank the server was attent and when we told her we were in a bit of a hurri she was certain to speed thing up for us overal our dine experi was not disappoint but it would certain not be my first choic for a nice sit down dinner at the mandalay bay hotelive been want to tri the border grill in la for the longest time  but i was in las vega for the weekend stay at mandalay bay and there was a border grill at the mandalay  so me and my friend decid to give it a tri  im not a vega person at all sinc i dont like to gambl  so i was just there for the pool drink and food  
susan fenig of the two hot tamal is the mastermind of border grill  ive heard a lot of great thing about it so i was veri excit to tri it out
w start out with the cadillac margarita and guacamol and chip  i like my margarita on the rock no salt  the waiter deliv mine with salt  no biggi i just wipe the salt away
th guacamol was okay  it was a bit on the creami side for my tast   i prefer guacamol on the chunki side  one of my friend just love the guac
i decid to order one of the special for the even which was high recommend by our waiter  it was tuna encrust with pistachio serv over a pobalno risotto top with a jicama slaw  my other two friend order the chile relleno and the pork slowli cook in banana leav  
the tuna was way overcook  so overcook that it was dri  the waiter when explain the special said it was cook medium slight pink  the risotto was also a big disappoint  some part seem like it wasnt cook enough  my dish was a big disappoint  also my meal wish lukewarm at best  it seem like it was sit out for a while  i shouldv return it after the first bite but i didnt sinc i had a second cadillac margarita to wash it down
mi friend meal were way better than mine  the chile relleno was veri good  but i thought the best meal was the pork slowli cook in banana leav  it was cook perfect and great flavor
for dessert we share the empanada stuf with dark chocol milk chocol and white chocol  and we also share the homemad ice cream a scoop of vanilla bean and a scoop of kahlua chip  the dessert was the best part of the meal for me unfortun  i realli want to love border grill  but my tuna special was a big disappoint  i may give it a second trythi time check out the la restaurmy famili and i went here for dinner after watch a show  we were pretti excit to eat here sinc were fan of top chef  we start off with their excel guacamol it was creami and fresh for our entre we got beef brisket taquito steak taco and saute shrimp which were great the meat was tender juici and full of flavor too bad i got the grill fish taco  the taco were nice plate with red white and green rice  howev i had fish bone on my taco and had to send them back 3 time  by the third time i still had fish bone and i just gave up on my entre  a girl could onli take so much bone swallow in one night  they comp my taco and our dessert which we appreci flourless chocol cake tres lech cake and anoth dessert  they were ok

it was a disappoint meal  i felt bad for our server who had to keep send my plate back to the kitchen  im not a diner whos a pita and i dont make complain a habit either but serious whoever was in charg of debon and fillet fish that night shouldnt be let back in the kitchen

bord grill fish taco never againthe search continu for qualiti ayc sushi in vega which shouldnt make sens when ayc and sushi are in the same sentence

walk in on a sunday even around 9 pm and the place is pretti pack  with onli four seat left at the sushi bar we take two of them near the end

th waitress got us our beverag order and bring out a littl plate of cook bean sprout  and then we start order with our sushi chef

first attempt  uni  the chef look at us and say they are out  oh  i should have gone with my gut and just left then and there

 seafood salad  one order per person and so we got one each  definit generous with the cut of fish  tuna and mackerel most on a bed of cucumb and daikon radish with a spici sauce

 amaebi  he ask us if we want the head and we say yes although we wonder if there an extra charg for it  two piec come out no rice  we dont complain about the lack of rice but wonder whi onli two piec when we did say two order  this item is one of the one order limit per person and we know two piec is usual one order  the head are deepfri but not enough as i had to spit out some of it  when we attempt to order our 2nd order of it later on he give us this look and say we are tri to order more than we are allow  were confus at this point and ask him if two piec account for one order  he say it doe for the other amaebi  he then pull out this plate of these tini sweet shrimp that i would have been insult if i got  so sinc we chose to get the head we got the jumbo size one regular size in everi other sushi restaur and that mean onli one piec per person  oh

w continu on with our nigiri choices
 
 yellowtail albacor salmon halibut giant clam one order limit and ikura  were confus when we get our fish becaus one of them is obvious tuna  it bright pink and you just know and plus we didnt order that  later on when we ask for hamachi think that it never came it point out that he did give us hamachi alreadi it was the pink one he serv us earlier  oh  hmmm also there too much rice for the size of fish cut he gave us  that never a good thing

and with the whole mix up of the amaebi and the lack of uni he offer us hamachi belli  this is the all white version and yes it good  but this is what i normal get when i order hamachi at a nice sushi restaur  so i still dont know what their version of regular hamachi look like  

from the appet we got softshel crab i wasnt particular fond of their batter for this agedashi tofu pretti good with an enjoy batter and hamachi kama  one thing for certain was that thing come out of the kitchen were super hot so watch your tongu 

were not big on roll and perhap this is also whi we werent as impress  they are known for their roll as mani yelper mention and sinc we didnt focus on their strength we werent as pleased

their save grace is that there no limit on dessert  unlimit ice cream green tea red bean and plum and mochi ice cream vanilla strawberri mango and chocol  although they were out of vanilla when i went

servic  the waitress do come often enough to clear dish if you put them on the side but dont bother if you leav them in front of you  i did have to request more tea so it just depend  our sushi chef wasnt the most person which set the tone for our dinner  he was holler at us from the start and plus i couldnt understand him either

lik anoth yelper mention we were the onli other asian peopl there besid the staff so if that make a differ to you  and it get loud  as in you can hear the convers of peopl from across the room  not sure if it the peopl who are loud or the acoust of the restaurant

yama sushi is definit one of the cheaper option for ayc sushi lunch 1995pp or dinner 2295pp in vega but wed rather pay a few buck more for a better experi  we probabl wont be back

25 starcame here with a veri larg group which the staff quick accommod and didnt mind when we continu to pull tabl over for friend who kept trickl in at ayc sushi at less than 25 it a freak steal and ayc mean alllll yce the entir menu no time limit no charg for leftov food but they wont bring new food unless you finish it

mi advice
 order half roll so you can tri more
 share everything
 seafood salad all sashimi with no rice best bang for your buck
 wear loosefit cloth becaus you are about to get down on some serious fatassery
 dont come here if you plan to wear a ho dress to a club immedi afterward

i wish i could rememb all i tri but we tri just about everyth includ ice cream they also serv sake and beer which my side of the tabl indulg in and quick becaus those loud boister peopl which no one seem to mind 

i wish i could give them more star but the servic wasnt the friendliest a friend of mine who doesnt eat seafood was complet ignor and his dish wasnt brought out until we were almost done we also notic that we were charg for 4 bottl of sake when we onli order 3 we told our waitress and a few minut later 4 waitress file out togeth stood in a line to confront us and angrili insist that we order 4 it was pretti unecessari and in poor tast we eventu resolv it and paid for the 3 that left a bad tast in my mouth but the sushi and the copious amount of booz left an amaz tast 3 stari am sad to say that yama is no longer my favorit ayc sushi joint in las vega i am happi for their success becaus they were final abl to expand but their custom servic has definit went down and so did the qualiti of the food that they offer 

the few time i have visit late the fish was too soft as if it has been sit out awhil and the roll serious lack in flavor the sauc arent even help it out the custom servic is a joke with a gentleman stick his finger in my face tell me he will be with me in one second 

but still definit the cheapest with the ayc dinner price of 2395i realli tri to like this place

th sushi is not veri well rolledthey arent tight and will fall apart as soon as you tri to pick them up with your chopstick the ingredi arent terribl which make it at least edibl but id avoid the roll if you can 

surpris they are usual pretti busi so there might be a wait for a tabl but the bar should alway have a few spot open the restaur itself is nice decor and offer a veri fun atmospher for dinner with some friend 

i wouldnt be back for the food but for drink possibl 

you wont leav feel satisfi but if your starv while shop in town sq i guess this will domy mom want to tri the infam croissantdonut and so i went on the hunt they were out at the two place i tri befor al so third time a charm we arriv around noon and there werent ani in the display case but the ladi behind the counter let me know that they had some in the back that she was busi dress so we had free reign on what flavor we could have by free reign i mean we were abl to choos from the three flavor they have chocol mapl and vanilla i opt to tri the chocol and mapl we didnt order ani regular donuts

thi donut shop is right across from unlv on the corner or harmon and maryland it small and not particular noteworthi and a littl on the dingi side the pastri were larg and a littl over sweet for my tast i love powder sugar but they were cover in them so it was a bit of overkil for the most part the pastri was moist and had good textur but i dont see myself go out of my way to tri them again soon i like wont be back unless im in the area again but it a good option for student or those who live in the areawe went to string with anoth coupl for dinner and i must say that this time was not as enjoy as my previous ventur here  in larg part that may be becaus on this occas i opt for a differ entre than veal marsala that had alway been consist excel  but a few other prepar dish were slight off form as well  as luck would have it this tend to happen whenev i tri to introduc friend to a restaur whose prais i have sung

th garlic bread was as good or better than ever  in las vega from my dine experi thus far onli the garlic bread at lavo reach this level of butteri and garlicki good  you could press a hot slice and liquid would ooz out of it  by night end my small group finish three baskets

anoth great dish onc again was stuf mushroom  this appet consist of button mushroom stuf with some pesto and gooey chees and top by an ampl quantiti of mellow marinara sauc and parmesan splinter  delici  i hard notic the pesto flavor which for me was a good thing becaus i am not a pesto aficiando

m come with minestron soup or salad but i got both sinc my wife is known as veggi hater for a reason  the homemad minestron soup had veri good mild spici broth but contain overcook cabbag  includ potato carrot zucchini and onion were fine  and my caesar salad no extra charg for a caesar was fair good with a creami caesar dressing

mi entre of veal picatta was made with a sauc that was white winebas lemoni and punctuat by caper  it was serv with roast potato and fresh veget and appear to be creami flouri and somewhat unusu look  but it tast good with the thin pound vealon not as remark as the marsala sauc i had previous sampl here  portion were good size but the asparagus spear on my plate were veri thin a rough varieti and somewhat burn  and uncharacterist the roast potato were underdon on the insid and slight burn on the outside

dessert here are first rate  while other at my tabl enjoy an exot bomb and tiramisu i had more runofthemil spumoni which though was good and refreshing

servic was friend fast and effici and the inform trattoria ambianc was nice  it was a 312star experitravel with friend is about make a seri of compromis and sinc i was go to get my way on our third day in sin citi i had to be good for the other two day day 1 end with dinner at lupo by wolfgang puck

i halfheart tri to talk my friend out of this place becaus base on the review i expect mediocr food at best at  price i dont mind spend money on food au contrair most of my discretionari incom goe to eat out but i want good food in return live in ny has made me veri spoil as if i wasnt bad enough befor and the prospect of spend money on subpar food made me grouchi but i swallow my complaint becaus i knew we were all make sacrific at one point or anoth for each other 

i dislik go to celebr restaur where a chef own a sever restaur becaus i know there is no way that they could possibl manag and visit each one on a regular basi i feel that theyr simpli sell their name this certain is the case with wolfgang puck and with lupo

w receiv two veri long breadstick and two differ kind of dip white bean and a black oliv tapenad for the stick although i enjoy the flavor of the white bean dip it was way too runni as none of the dip clung to the breadstick in order to get the flavor of the dip i had to let the bread soak the dip which then made the bread mushi the dip need to be thicker more like a spread rather than wateri like soup

i order linguin alla vongol linguin with clam becaus i love this dish in general it was 26  the typic price point i expect for an upscal restaur i receiv was a vegass platter of food i was onli expect half as much food inde even if they had onli given me half i would have thought that it was a generous serv the food was a sad disappoint the clam were overcook i would have prefer the pasta to be a littl more al dent and the sauc made from oliv oil was way too runni like the dip the qualiti of the food is entir unworthi of an upscal restaurant

th dessert howev were quit delight we order the 15 layer chocol cake with gelato and the tiramisu the 15layer cake made of 15 veri thin layer of milk chocol and dark chocol cake it had a veri good chocol flavor and rich the tiramisu wasnt quit the tradit tiramisu as there wasnt as much ladi finger and far more mouss it was more a tiramisu mouss but it was love and light we polish off the dessert with much gusto 

except for the superl dessert i would rate the food as 2 s lupo get anoth star from me becaus of the servic serious the servic at lupo was absolut incred and it was one of the best servic experi that ive ever had they were absolut correct in everyth serv from the left and remov from the right water was discreet and miracul refil without draw our attent a beauti synchron harmoni of waiter busser and runner work togeth to creat a masterpiec of a posh eleg dine experi too bad the food didnt match the level of expertis and care given to us by the staffi like cuban food so i had to come here  we went earli on a slow night  for starter we got the shrimp cevich tapa tast plate 2 empanada chicken and beef croqueta and mariquitasplantain chip  the empanada were good and had good flavor but the crust was a tad bit thick  the croqueta had a strong ham tast to them which was good  the shrimp cevich also came with plantain chip cut differ  the plantain chip werewel plantain chips

for our entre we got the tast plate pollo tequila lechon asado ropa vieja with moro cristiano madurossweet plantain and bean and rice  i like the lechon asado ropa vieja and maduro  the lechon was tender and juici but i wish it had crispi skin to it  the ropa vieja was tender and didnt lack flavor unlik the pollo tequila  the maduro were great  sweet and was not undercook 

the servic was not so good  the server took our order and gave us our basket of bread and forgot about us  she didnt check on us  she had her shock face on when she pass by our tabl 2030 minut later and still with no food on our tablaok is well a bit of an overstat for 3star i think that 3star might better read for jason as not disappoint if you know it a cafeteria style deli that cant possibl do it all but tri and consid just how much they do in togo busi id say they have to be do someth right 

whi jason when i had all of vega as my food pallet again like last night with metro pizza i didnt want to miss american idol pick of the top 24 and jason on maryland parkway was my solut to get in at 645p and get out in time to return to the hotel by 8pm the plan worked

i did the corn beef and pastrami on rye with melt swiss and russian dress it was better than i expect not the best but it satisfi my pickl brisket fixat but it didnt stop there i also order their broccolli and chees bake potato oy vay what was i think their bake potato are liter the size of a small footbal no kid while the chees was more of the whizz persuas the overal effect was a good in your face with a 3 pound spud i also order a carrot cake and cheesecak slice and no i didnt eat it all in fact i onli ate half the sandwich 20 of the potato and the dr pepper with unlimit refil the rest went into togo contain and will probabl end up at the trade show tomorrow for our lunch 

the thing that jason has in it favor is that it a refug for the hungri and typic to vega it an allnight kinda place youll see a parad of interest charact march into jason at just about ani hour and by my own word i guess i contribut to that interest parad dont think of jason as a ny style deli think of it as a super casual cafeteria with a delib there enough on the menu and at the allyoucaningest salad bar drink fountain and softe ice cream machin that youll never leav hungri just dont let the term gourmet cloud your expec dont do that and you wont be disappointi love me some pollo loco but this locat is slow i came here around 145 think the lunch rush would be over by then but the line for the drivethru still look quit daunt i decid to wait it out anyway sinc i was crave some of their spici avocado salsa 

i wait in the line a good 15 minut befor i got my food and was on my way back to work not horribl but still a littl longer than you would expect from a fast food drive thru dure off hour servic was still friend and effici onc i actual got to the windowa littl tast of san diego ca in the middl of sin citi 

when buffet and typic franchis fare aint hittin it drive the rental car over to the far south end of this strip mall on nelli blvd and get your carn asada fix 

they got it all and a salsa bar includ sorri the hot sauc is self serv no tini prepackag plastic tub thrown into your bag 

the folk work here could use a littl more person in the kitchen there a stack of tortilla 3 feet high the burrito are smaller than what i see in socal the price are about the same and the joint is cleaner than most 

it help they put up photo of the food on the overhead menu 

the ignor gringo who frequent taco bell have no idea what to order

i was shock my relat who live 3 mile from here for the past 15 year never tri this place befor 

i was readi to throw a spici carrot slice at themit hard to review this place sinc im not real big on asian cuisin to start with

it is a real holeinthewal dive about 1012 booth line the wall and 46 tabl in the center of the veri cramp space

their server are veri fast  friend bring out tea  drink immedi and then the meal come out in a veri time manor

b warn veri larg portion are serv here

i had the egg rollspork fri ricesweet roast pork and sweet  sour chicken 

we also order beef chow mein but didnt eat it it had veri thick noodl a film of some veri distast sauc  tough meat skip this dish

now the rest of it was great the pork fri rice  sweet roast pork was the best of it i like the sweet  sour chicken but i would go pork next time

i will have to tri the spare rib next time but this is definit a takeout place unless you like close quarter which alot of peopl do

ther were 2 larg parti here when i went they seem like regular and realli enjoy their mealthis review is a bit late as i just realiz that i never submit a review for our visit here it was just not that memor i suppos so it sort of just slip my mind i have read the recent review and it appear the price have gone up for their famous burger when we dine here back in septemb it was still 395 for a burger and add 50 cent for chees which is a must have on a hamburger

it is a small old school 70s style loung veri laid back and dark insid with a bar and a section with booth and tabl to dine at if you do not like or can not toler the smell of heavi smoke than you may want to skip come to dine here just an fyi 

the servic is fine and prompt the price were good at the time and the food was simpl and tasti i also enjoy dip my french fri into the honey mustard sauc they provid tabl side our tab was about 1500 for two cheeseburg with fri and two drink i enjoy my cheeseburg and fri howev my boyfriend was not crazi about his at all and complain of a greasi stomach ach short after we left 

if in the area i might stop by for a cheeseburg howev i would certain not make a special trip to the east side of town like we did on this occaswhile the food was excel and our booth was comfort there were some signific problem on my first visit here  

limey guacamol made tablesid to order of spice tomato onion and cilantro tast veri good along with homemad tortilla chip hot salsa and a mild bean dip  fideo soup was differ and interest tomato base but not notic so with delic thin and short noodles

wat refil came slowli and had to be request  but far wors food was realli long in come  we were told the food on the way and it should be here soon  but it realli wasnt  in fact my parti of four was seat at 630 pm we order the main meal at 700 pm and other than guacamol and soup no food arriv until 57 minut later  a friend shrimp dish was request to be avocado free but her order of a mexican omelet includ slice avocado  the manag did take item off the bill but i would much rather had my order time served

dian enjoy her shrimp quesadilla and i realli like my 12 combo  so becaus the qualiti and tast of the food were so good here i will make a return trip and hope that the timeli and effici of cook and serv both improvtwo out of three aint bad

   in recent time i have dine here three time and in christma day 2012 for lunch i have sampl three entre shrimp with lobster sauc pepper steak and spici eggplant two of the three entre were delici and one was ok the shrimp with lobster sauc was delici the next time i eat here it will most like be the dish that i order for the record this is the first chines restaur that i recal in vega where the shrimp base entre are the exact price as the other entre the pepper steak was also delici but the shrimp with lobster sauc was better in my opinion howev the spici eggplant was ok it could have been softer and tastier two entre tast delici out of three aint bad

  the lunch special is a good deal that end at 3 pm the special go for 595 as i wrote they includ shrimp base entre that are usual 50 cent more at the competit the lunch special includ white rice corn soup or hot and sour soup and an egg roll of the spring roll varieti a cold beverag increas the lunch special to 8 befor the tip 

  as an observ yelper i notic a coupl of thing the portion are smaller than the competit howev there is none of the filler chow mien noodl that some restaur fill half the plate with this is the onli chines restaur where fri rice or brown rice is miss from the luncheon special i could eat white rice as long as it has soy sauc on it it just that fri rice and brown rice are far tastier and when i go out to eat in a chines restaur i prefer the tastiest rice

  beij chines restaur is in the eastern be ltway shop center it is away from the walmart mad but veri close to the eastern avenu mad right off the interst 215 exit

  i rate beij chines restaur 3 star equival to a b id like to conclud this review with a tip if you catch the lunch special save your appetit for the german bakeri nextstori dont use the drive thru much but i was in a hurri to drop off my rental car and park was non exist 

mi order a angus burger combo and a appl pie the burger was good onli except there was excess mayo the fri were cook perfect  crisp and yummi ive alway been a fan of the appl pie at two for 99 or the same for one end up get onli one

c go wrong with mcdonald if your in a hurri for fast food and they offer healthi optionfirst off it hard to compar this place with other sushi joint local to las vega becaus i am technic a southern cali girl but overal i did have a good experi at this place 

some friend and i were run some last minut errand in las vega and we were way off the strip to take care of them we were also quit hungri and just look for some decent food we saw along the way it was either sushi or greek everyon felt like sushi so as soon as i saw a decent sushi place i said let go to that one 

so we park and head insid this place is tini as heck we luckili got seat fast but then a line start to form immedi after us we definit luck out i can onli imagin how long you must have to wait to be seat when there are so few seat in this joint

th servic was not bad but they did forget two of our order but the sushi was veri good we didnt opt for the all you can eat becaus there no way i could eat 27 worth of sushi all by myself i wasnt that hungri i instead just order 2 roll which came out to less than 15 total and i was a happi camper the roll were delici and satisfi 

this place is busi and seem veri popular among all it must be a rare good sushi place in vega and so that whi everyon come here in my person opinion it veri hard to find good asian food in vega i have not been veri impress but this place is the first to semi impress me i would actual come back again if i felt like drive off the strip for some sushiif your not look to travel far for all you can eat sushi you should stroll over to this place it in an older plaza but i never let appear affect my decis to eat somewher ive had some of the best food in my life in hole in the wall place 

the beer and sake for all you can eat is not so tasti the beer had a weird smell to it but they do have a few roll that were pretti good 
 
the top 3 ive had here 

mike roll  it list on the wall
d12 i cant rememb for sure it d something
mexican

im big into anyth unhealthi when i eat sushi i like the fri stuff with cream chees the bake clam here are realli good 

with the review on here im surpris there were 3 of us and the servic was extrem fast and good they were all veri friend and serv us promptlyth place was half full at 700pm on a friday and it was full after we had been there for 30 minut it not the best sushi in nw las vega but it also not the worst 
i had to sit here for 30 minut and weight out 23 star and i final decid on 3 your welcom summerlin sushiahhh my local bk  it is like everi other bk around and is pretti consist  it get the job done when you are in a rush and dont have time to cook

i have to admit i am here pretti regular  it is becaus 

1 i live around the corner and it is the closest place to my house
2 it is cheap and has ok burger and chicken sandwiches
3 my kid love the milkshak and smoothi they have on the menu  i love make her happi so we visit pretti often
4 the play place is pretti fun for the littl one  it is especi nice when it is so hot in the summer  it is nice and air condit which us las vegan love
5 i may or may not be addict to the new satisfries

thi particular locat has just gone through a remodel  it is now more modern with a coffe hous style to it  the food is still the same but it is now in a prettier locale

so if you want a fast food joint this one is pretti and pretti good at what they doonc upon a time i use to come to this place to meet friend for late night drink and to hang out  that was a long time ago when it first open  now i onli stop by when i take one of the car in for servic next door at ted wien auto servic which was the case dure my most recent visit

it a nice place to hang out and have a few drink while you kill time  there are video poker machin on the bar but sinc i dont gambl i hung out at one of the tabl near the bar and surf the web on my ipad

th bartend were veri friend and boredtheyd talk to a rock if they could so you should have some nice compani too

overal it a pretti cool neighborhood bar  they serv food but i wasnt hungri the day i was there so no food this trip

return factor  50stop by for lunch the other day  this particular locat has a hand of tabl and chair insid  when i went there were onli a few peopl in the joint

i order a small 9 italian sub genoa salami capacola prosciutini whot pepper provolon mustard mayo pickl lettuc tomato onion  also had a bag of jalapeno chip and bottl water to go with the sandwich

th food came out a few minut later and i dove right in  as usual it was a sloppi meal with stuff fall out of the sandwich  the ingredi were fresh and tasti  for some reason even though it a small sandwich it alway veri filling

ov the year capriotti has declin somewhat  it use to blow me away now that it been franchis i think their ingredi have lost some qualityc support that with fact onli my opinion after eat at various capriotti for over 17 yrs

will i return  probabl but wont crave it like i use tolate night out need some postbar help order 2 doubl stacker in the drive thruquick and accur order  that all i ask for from a fast food joint  the burger were just ok it burger king for cri out loud

return factor  60im a fan of their food just not a fan of the slow servic when i first move out here jamm was our go to breakfastbrunch becaus my boss love this place  at the time we love it too becaus we knew that our breakfast or brunch would take at least an hour of our work day  the wait and the servic usual take awhil  on my last visit the wait was better and the our food came out faster  but it still took a while in my opinion  

as for their food there a big select of your typic breakfast item  price is actual pretti good and tast is not too bad  

mi past orders
jamm signatur omelet  this is the king of all omelet here  steak and mushroom domin this omelet  this is all you need becaus you are definit stuf after eat this one 

chicken fri steak  egg  actual my favorit dish here  their chicken fri steak is tender and the batter is not too heavi  portion are huge as well 

jamm french toast  their french toast has a differ look to them i alway thought that they were overcook but theyr not  the french toast is crispi on the outsid and after it drench in syrup soft in the insid  my second favorite

steak  egg  i had this on my most recent visit and can onli saystick with your favorit  the steak had no tast and was a bit too dri  i felt like i was eat cardboard  but then again stick with your favorit when you come here  


overal jamm is just okay  with all the other breakfast joint in our beauti citi it tough to say that jamm rank abov them all  but if your look for a decent breakfast with a lot of option jamm is the way to go 


yelp person challeng  056366i went last night and i was pay for it the rest of the night  

gosh i just love eat all that uni ikura and raw oyster  it so good  the catepillar roll san rice and then you add a littl uni and ikura on top  yum yum  

the husband and brotherinlaw creat their own hand roll of uni ikura sprout and gobo root  or salmon skin hand roll with some tako as well

their scoop of green tea ice cream 250 is pretti good and the coconut sorbet that come in a coconut shell remind me of my honeymoon  veri coconutty

appar they dont take reserv for the sushi bar after 5 pm  they dont have ani regular tabl but they let you sit at the teppanyaki tabl instead and order sushi from the waitstaff  and were begin to think it actual faster and more effici get our food while sit at the tabl instead of at the bar  the girl are pretti good about check on you a lot and bring the food quick wherea when you sit at the bar  you have to wave at the sushi chef to get their attenta famili outing a rare occas i would say but my brother pull anoth rather spend time with some hoochi than famili dont want to get into detail but we were fed up from wait for him to go eat and told him to just forget it sometim i wish he would care more about his famili than some random girl that he bare even know make me realli sad that he treat us like this sorri guy i know this is a review

so i took my parent to hikari for ayc they love sashimi i love fri food i know it bad but i like it so here what i ordered

seawe salad 2x  the first one was light tasti and fresh second time around it was way too salti and over sauced

cucumb salad  half moon size cut crisp juici crunch it was ok

salmon skin salad  drown in real tangi vinegar dress made my tongu numb there were bit of salmon meat not skin that were hard as a rock almost like bone be care in eat this you can chip off your tooth if your not watch your bite howev there were piec of salmon skin that were a light bite like potato chip that was onli a few

fresh oyster  my mother love this and ate about 8 of them and even had one more for dessert yike i had one but that sucker was huge and i had to realli break it down to swallow it i prefer those thin slimi kind you just slide in your mouth and swallow this was like wtheck thick my parent love it me on the other hand pass on order more

tempura combo  i had the whole thing the shrimp was ok carrot zucchini onion mushroom were noth spectacular the crunchi coat didnt have ani flavor to it disappointed

bak green mussel  they cut the mussel in half so you dont eat the whole piec it was wateri mayonnais was so sour and it just tast off

dynamit  again mayonnais was too tangi and too much i couldnt tast anyth but the sour the bite of seafood were hard to chew like leather not edibl and had to take it out of my mouth a few time dont order it

kama  my father ate the whole thing said it was tender and flavorful

fri rice shrimp  i finish the whole dish it was veri delici and almost order a second round but want to tri other dish good choic if you like fri rice

hamachi yellow tail  my mother enjoy this veri much and order it again

hot scallop  veri fresh and a beauti white color gleam with perfect it was satisfi and good probabl the onli thing i like besid the fri rice at this place

ama ebi  shrimp  we all ate a few it was cute and yummy

tuna roll  had no flavor look bad almost like a grayish color my mother onli had one and said it was terribl shoot it look terribl had to hide the other five under anoth dish dont order it youll thank me

caterpillar roll  nice present but didnt realli tast the roll didnt work for me

miso soup  it was sooth and steami hot good start to this meal

end with green tea and red bean mochi for dessert 2 which isnt includ in the ayc deal 27 the dessert was good i like the green tea more sinc it tast fresh versus the red bean that tast and look kinda old

th ice green tea was refresh and the server were veri attent in clear our plate when we were done the sushi chef were all busi with request and order but ask us from time to time if we were okay or want anyth els one chef with glass seem to have a real cocki attitud but mayb coz my face was all scab up and he didnt want to be nice to me whatev other than that i would say it a decent place for ayc but it will be one of those this dish was good and that dish was bad it not realli consist in have all their food be delici and well cook would i go here again onli if i have toim okay with baja fresh but i dont go veri often

i appreci the salsa is fresh and kept clean i like that the food is fresh and doesnt make me feel like im gonna have cardiac arrest

i tend to like burrito bowl and i thought it rather weird they charg you to upgrad ituh you save a tortilla by pute it in a contain isnt that not a downgrad  i would think they wouldnt charg you 150 to do that 

it has the same amount of food in the bowl as a burrito so you didnt realli get more for the price which i initi thought was the price differ serious unwrap one and throw it in a bowl and see sure they add lettuc but it not even much onli other upgrad avail enchiladawet style burritothat make sens sinc your gain sauc and chees i guess make bowl at chipotl do a burrito at baja 

 i know it a small thing but it rather weird to mei dont come here often but when i do i order their chicken nacho  as ive mention befor after i realiz how mani calori are in one of these bad boy 2020 calori i reduc the number of visit to baja fresh  that 3 hour on the ellipt for me

thi locat is conveni becaus it in a shop center with walmart  sam club nearbywhich are 2 place i frequent  of cours their signatur salsa bar and plenti of seat is available

wil i return  when im in the mood to gain some poundag ill stop bythe person who help us at the regist tonight was realli nice and help about check a price but manag wouldnt budge

i bought a crate this morn for our mark and destruct doggi at the spring mtn locat for 38 

got home and the other dog doesnt need to be crate but end up enjoy it that i decid we should go get her one too so it fair 

the same crate is 43 here 

i just find it weird how a big place like walmart has differ price and doesnt honor it at anoth store 

this store is best at night to me in the morn clusterfuck poor associatesthi is one crazi volum store to maintain and somehow it stay fair neatwarn  heresi to follow

i dont get it  

the food is ok the servic was great but peopl wait 23 hour on the weekend  why

thank when i went on an offpeak night i onli had to wait about 40 minut which is still a long time for me  patienc is not my strong suit  the wait staff was veri curteous  help but the food which i was expect to be orgasm i even brought an extra pair of boxer just in case was just sort of ok to good  certain not ill have what hes have worthi   actual it probabl for the best  girl can go on and do the whole ofac thing  guy cant  we just look like were have a seizur  but i digress  

mayb im just a pizza snob which is a pretti safe bet most chicagoan are  mayb this is the best pizza in phoenix which is kinda like say a place is the best seafood hous in kansa citi  i just dont see what all the hoopla is abouti ate here a coupl of year ago and fortun i had some friend who got there earli and i onli had to wait an hour an hour for me is like three hour if i go to a restaur and the wait is 30 minut ill go somewher els when i am hungri i want to eat right away but i heard amaz thing about pizzeria bianco so i had to tri it out i think the atmospher was cute it was my first time eat in a restaur that use to be a hous so i thought that was realli cool when i tri the pizza i wasnt blown away but it was good at least i can say ive been to bianco but i am not sure i would go back consid cibo is right down the street and serv the same kind of pizza without the torturscale of 110 singl visit
9 food
7 service
9 atmosphere
7 value

becaus of the ungod wait i just cant recommend this place  and there noth major i think they should chang besid some gruff servic creat by their desir to turn tabl in the wake of such press demand it just that whi would you wait 23 hour for this pizza when you can get equal as good stuff with no wait over at cibo  if cibo had show up on tv instead of bianco the role would be revers but it didnt iron make cibo the best pizza place in phoenixsigh 

i can hard believ it but i final ate at pizzeria bianco one of america most famous and high rate pizzeria 

after 5 differ and fail attempt to tri a slice of oprah favorit pizza i contempl a plan to get in by call on behalf of a cancer stricken girl with onli a month to live and one dream to eat at pizzeria bianco 

instead i took someon advic and made sure i got there earli on a friday night and when i say earli i mean not earli enough becaus at 345pm there were alreadi 50 peopl ahead of me estim wait time 2 hour and did i mention i got there at 345pm and his door dont even open until 5pm 

25 hour laterto be exact i was seat brows through the simpl menu i decid to start with the spiedini the italian fontina chees wrap in prosciutti was a littl too rich for me as for the pizzasdid you catch the plural i decid to order all 6 yes 6 of the list pizza 

i figur the chanc of me wait anoth 3 hour to get into pizzeria bianco were slim to none so i better order all of them and get it done effici with the help of my bf we finish 45 26 pizza out of the 6 pizza in one seat the margherita marinara rosa sonni boy biancoverd and wise guy told you i could throw down  the tabl besid us were either disgust or shock out of the 6 my favorit was the marinara pizza it stole my heart with it boast yet simpl flavor of just 3 ingredientstomato garlic and oregano the rosa was my least favorit becaus of the overwhelm amount of onion be a meat lover i was disappoint with the protein shakesi mean pizza they were hooverdam and drench with oil not sure if theyr alway like that or if it was just our order i prefer my pizza to be moist not drench 

overal pizzeria bianco has amaz dough and tasti pizza i dont think it live up to it hype take into consider the ridicul wait time and my hunger pang but it is an experienceto be abl to tri such a famous restaur locat in our own backyard id returna long as someon els stand in line ive alreadi taken one for the teamok i know ill probabl get a lot of flack for not rate this place 15 star but i gotta be honest

w went for a friend birthday sinc we need a special occas to wait 25 hour for a tabl  we were told we could wait at the bar next door bar bianco  it was great predrink is alway a good time but about 2 hour into the wait we went to check on our tabl and we were told we were taken off the list becaus we didnt check in everi hour  we were never told this was requir oh well it ad anoth half hour to our wait timeannoy but whatev  3 hour of waiting

onc we final got seat we were so excit from the anticip that we were immedi let down by the servic  we told our server we were celebr a birthday and he said you and three other tabl  hmmmwell ok i guess you deal with special occas a lot 
ill sum up the rest of the visit  food was good but im sorri not great  servic was averag no enthusiasm about a wine recommend and i guess they dont believ in water refil and last our birthday girl wasnt even offer a dessert or a drink  im not expect free stuff but i think it just restaur standard to make the bday person feel special in some way right

al in all mayb becaus of all the hype and the 3 hour wait we expect more  oh wellafter live 2 block away for over a year i final took the jump and decid to deal with the long wait to tri this place out  got there at 730 on a tuesday night 25 hour wait  to be expect but still pretti ridicul  

went next door to bar bianco order a bottl of wine and patient wait outsid  i think that the wait is part of the allur for peopl  also after wait hungri for 3 hour the food becom tastier becaus you are starv  

final get a tabl at 1015  order the capres salad and anoth bottl of wine  the ingredi are veri fresh  the mozz is excel the tomato are veri veri fresh and tasti and the basil was great as well  

the server didnt make ani recommend on wine or food  a bit odd  given that the wait is 3 hour and that it prici for a pizza joint youd think that the servic would be excel  not at all the case  this guy act like everyon here is a regular  the realiti is that with 3 hour wait for a tabl i dont have time to be a regular at this place 

we order 2 pizza to tri biancoverd and wiseguy  they were pretti good again with good ingredi  i wouldnt say it was the best pizza ive ever had but veri tasti  ask for some balsam to go with the mozz and tomato had to ask the server 2 time final we snag a food runner she got it for us  i shouldnt have to ask for someth 3 time i mean realli this place onli has like 6 tabl pay attent to the guest  

i guess the moral here is that tri this place is all about the experi and say that youv been there  while bianco is good you can go to parlor or cibo and get veri good compar pizza without a 3 hour wait  

is it good yes 
is it worth the wait nopeive liter wait year to tri this place out and final made it here sinc now they are open for lunch  i am glad we got seat right away if we had to wait the report 23 hour when they use to onli be open at night i would be piss and here is why

w got there about 230pm and were seat right away  the place was way smaller than what i imagin  we got the last tabl back by the restroom  these seat arent made for big peopl  if we had peopl sit next to us you would have felt like you were right on their lap  our waitress was friend and came over and got our drink  bottl drink onli so my wife got an ice tea and i got a coke  it mexican coke so that was good  3 buck for the ice tea and 250 for the coke  we then place our order which was a margherita a rosa and a sonni boy  the pizza onli took about 7 minut to come out and here is how they stack up

margherita solid  just plain chees and sauc with some basil on top  pretti tasti  way too thin though as that would be par for the course

sonni boy probabl the best one of the bunch  the salami and oliv combo was pretti tasti  again thoughway too thin  some of the crust was burnt too  i dont mind some char and actual prefer it but burntined is nasti and this had a piec or two that were like that

rosa accord to a lot of foodi this pizza is the holi grail  well guess what  it was freak nasti  i did not like it at all  it came out and look super wet  it was drench in oliv oil  i mean like puddl of oil  i ate a piec real quick and the pistachio were the onli decent part of it  the rosemari was nasti the onion and too much oil overpow the thing and the grate chees they use tast a littl off  i ate one more piec of it becaus i didnt want to wast ani  well guess what  i didwast 4 slice   our waitress ask if we want a box for it and i said no  she repli with that a first  and it was probabl truei just didnt like the combo of flavor and honest it wasnt good at all

tot for 3 pizza and 2 drink 52 buck  steep  after a 10 dollar tip 6200 and chang for some paper thin pizza that was good but nowher near amaz  i made my one trip there and it will probabl be my last i got to cross it off my list of place to eat but i drew a sad face next to it becaus it just wasnt worth it  oh wellth next 3 night i get to eat at grimaldi which is a fantast pizza and my undisput favorit pizza in az  i just wish bianco live up to the hypethank god we made reserv for 6 peopl befor i got here becaus it not worth the suppos 34 hour wait i hate to say it i do but that the truth 

the place is pack and incred small the size of the place was like a small apart kind of uncomfort for me but i can see how some peopl would like the cozi 

as we bite in the crust is light airi but over burnt on our pizza lot of oven mark on the bottom of the pizza if your into that kinda thing ingredi tast fresh but seem like was slight cold did they leav these out a littl too long bubbl up soda was light and tasti just like a 7 up 

total for the 6 of us  127 sorri but im go back to ciboive want to go to bianco for a veri veri long time so as soon as i knew i was head to phoenix i told my friend he was get drag here

might be great for area  but ive had better neapolitan pizza in the us includ my favorit littl place back home pupatella i did get to introduc my friend to neapolitan style pizza  someth hed never had  but not sure id do the hour plus wait here again

w end up sit at the bar sinc that what open up first and the bartend was great and didnt mind me practic my italian on him i love the hous made miner water the top are all top rate on the pie the sauc fragrant and flavor but ala the chees and crust were a littl disappoint  the crust in particular lack flavor 

our pies
margherita  tomato sauc fresh mozzarella basil my stapl for judg ani neapolitan pizzaiola offer  realli would never get this again veri disappoint in this pie

sonni boy  tomato sauc fresh mozzarella salami gaeta oliv solid pie  great top make up for the flavorlack crust

wiseguy  wood roast onion hous smoke mozzarella fennel sausag best we had  perfect blend of flavor and aromas


im give bianco 3 star even though ive had better neapolitan pizza we had a good time and the staff was friend  to give them lower would be unfair but i realli was fair meh about their much laud pizzahad lunch here with arlin b and rand h and yes the pizza is good here but i do not think it is good enough for the price or the waitth crust was realli good and the top were ok but i prefer a meat lover pizza pile highther are at least 5 other pizza place i would rather eat at  i would probabl never return here becaus i was not as impress as much as mani other yelper arei realli want to love this place all of the yelp review i saw befor go paint durant as a place of mystiqu a place where old tradit and dine style thrive and dont chang even as fusion and new american restaur surround it i definit felt the mystiqu i definit experienc the old tradit and dine style i just dont know if i love how tradit durant was mayb i just expect that expens restaur will wow me with their flavor and need more from a dine experi than the old american formula of a protein and starch especi when the starch isnt particular memor or flavor 

dont get me wrong there were some great thing about our experi at durant the overwhelm red decor was romant retro although i can see it be an awkward color to be surround by while on a busi lunch the cream of mushroom soup was creami and delici my lobster tail was huge albeit a littl dri and our dirti martini were huge and mix realli well the servic was also veri professin and attent howev stick with an establish approach to dine shouldnt mean not be attent to qualiti and i felt like for the price we spent certain thing like my husband salad and steak as well as the pretti terribl rice pilaf and mash potato side could have been brought into the 21st centuri or at least made more tasti 

as the dinner came to a close we were there at 9 or so on a tuesday night we got to be parti to a veri interest convers between a woman sit at the bar and the veri oldschool bartend she said that she had live in phoenix for 35 year but quick move to rant about her daughter who she claim was gorgeous a part of the happen scottsdal crowd and a former flame of derek jeter she even offer to bring her to durant and introduc her to the bartend wow what a girl if she doe exist this woman also had opinion on a varieti of other subject includ cell phone provid and didnt stop talk dure our entir main cours 

this littl dialogu monologu made me realiz someth though time chang women who probabl use to have meatloaf or roast with a bake potato and spinach for everi meal are now sit in restaur talk about their daughter date basebal star and how bad their cell phone recept is indoor i figur if they can get just a littl bit with it so can durant no major chang necessari  just a slight step back and reevalu of the menu to decid whether rice pilaf would be worth swap out for a roast asparagus im not tri to be a traitor to a timeless institut or ask that it chang it essenti charact  i just think that a few littl tweak here and there would keep the local popul loyal and keep folk like me who want realli good food partway there in an amaz environ with friend servic check come backunderwhelm  that the onli word for it i was realli sad about that too i went with great expect of an old school even out the decor didnt disappoint the dark heavi furnish work well in the dim light the nailhead accent upholsteri look right at home against the velvet flower wallpap the host wear a tux and the waiter were similar attir the servic was for the most part excel though they did have a hard time keep up with us on the water but they figur it out

real it was the food that im give 35 star it was good but for those price in that atmospher with their reput and histori  well good just doesnt cut it i could have had good in a coupl of dozen place for half the price for exampl i had salmon it was good it came with mash potato that were reput to be garlicki and a salad that was mix green three crouton and half a bottl of dress it cost about 30 the thing is i had an equal good piec of salmon recent at arcadia farm for around 12 or 13 we share a fruit crisp for dessert and it was the same thing we paid 10 for a scoop of ice cream a bowl of granola and a hint of appl and peach we could have gone up the street a block to fez and had a much better dessert for less

so i guess what id say about durant is this go somewher els  twicetalk about cognit dissonance

i love the idea behind this place authent cuisin art adorn the wall innov cuisin nofril attitud and a jame beard nomin chef

her what kill this place gabe he is one of the worst server i have had in a while he kill the experi made us want to leav in a hurri and in essenc ruin a nice dinner  

detail of the fooddrinks
b were 475 hubbi got the hous margarita and while he did say they were pour weak it was quit refresh and use a great mix
quesadilla with langostin borracho my favorit dish of the even  it didnt arriv quesdilla style at all  we had 4 small tortilla top with the grill langostin and wonder flavor chunk of goat chees there was a flavor pico de gallo in the center  it was total unexpect and total good
cochinita pibil everyon rave about this dish  it was veri well prepar with slowroast pork fresh made tortilla sourorang onion a wonder mash potato made with chipotl pepper which i found out from a food runner sinc gabe was mia and an interest veget to go with the asparagus i think this veget is the chayot from listen to anoth waiter explain thing to his guest with great enthusiasm cue jealous look now  with all this someth didnt quit add up in the dish  the flavor didnt come togeth and wow me
chicken mole the mole sauc was nice with a good complex but there was hard ani sauc on the plate  nice cook piec of chicken wrap up in tortilla with mole and a cream sauc drizzl over the top more chayot and asparagus  good but not great

now onto gabe  ooh im still so mad  he was gruff inattent and just rude  when i ask if they had pitcher of beer i got a brusqu no as he look down his nose at me  the hubbi order his drink and i said id like anoth minut  that was a mistak 5 minut later he bring the hubbi margarita and doesnt ask if id like anyth he just walk away  as we flag his down to order our appet i was final allow to order a glass of water and a beer  we had to flag him down for everyth and when the option of dessert came up he rattl them off to us without explain them and when we werent readi to decid yet left again  a wonder young ladi who box up our food brought us a menu so we could read about the dessert  i was so mad that i didnt want to pay 12 buck for a dessert and have to deal with gabe ani longer

overal final thoughts
innov chef with interest idea some cohes is miss from some dish though
fix gabe serious he ruin our night other server were warm friend answer question check on their guest etc
pric are a bit steep im not cheap by ani mean but i felt like we paid a lot and didnt receiv quit the same in return  
serious about gabeive been live in downtown phoenix for about 5 month now i drive past barrio cafe on almost a daili basi it constant pack it seem and ive heard noth but good thing about it final my boyfriend and i decid to stop by for dinner i have to say i am a littl disappoint mayb my hope were too high but our meal werent as great as i thought theyd be especi for the price my boyfriend had the carn asada taco  they were the blandest taco ive ever tast filiberto has better taco i had the duck salad that actual was fair good but there was a littl too much duck fat for my tast the menu also list grill tomato in my salad but there liter was one tomato veri odd

th thing i enjoy the most though was the artwork by lalo a truli talent artist i enjoy check out his artwork while eat the decor is realli cool too although a bit cram inside

i had chino bandido for lunch that same day and honest it was far more enjoy than barrio cafe  and much cheaper id rather go there ani day over this place it was good but noth like what i thought itd be wont be go back i dont thinkgreat great food but go to the bank first and check you account balanc caus the price are ridiculous

guacamol is veri differ but in a good way appet are amaz main dish although flavor are incred expens their version of carn asada is serv them taco style it might be mexican cuisin but im not a fan

their favor margarita known as the low rider will sneak up on you so be care it will also sneak up on your wallet at 13 dollar a pop

servic in the restaur for us was good but the food came out too slowli so be awar that you might have to wait a while it also veri loud with hard floor and the place pack up pretti fast

mi advic is to go for a nice bottl beer and share a main cours meal or go at happi hour and save some coin on some incred good appet at leas you can enjoy the food and not break the bank

would i go back again prolli not

stewok i get that it is superbowl sunday and most place are dead but come on we love the food here been go to this place for at least 15 year or more if i could eat five gallon bucket of their carn adovado and never gain an ounc life would be complet but ala im not into throw up
so we did not feel like stay home for the big game and were kinda not into huge crowd also we arent popular enough to get invit to ani superbowl parti  at least none with out squirrel sloppi joe insid joke
so we ventur on over to one of our favorit spot normal i can toler footbal here as they keep the sound off and play great music while my guy take in his game i hate footbal and i take in great wine and great eat we had heard that for the card play in the super bowl they would have the sound up and the game live i have home town spirit so what the heck it onli onc a year
w sat down right at 400 and the pregam stuff wasnt even on the place was desert as expect with a few seat tabl and a coupl of guy at the bar after a guy complain that the game was not on the bar tender ask us what channel is the game on then he act all piss that he had to turn the game on
mi man ask if the sound was suppos to be on and the hostess repli yeah theyr work on it we miss the nation anthem how unpatriot rich there was anoth 15 minut of the men in the bar freak out that they were watch the card play in the super bowl with no sound i suggest that we check to see if the sound is up at dick hide away and we could all just pick up our beer and walk over there the bartend was so blase about it all as he announc that he hate footbal and he could care less final he reach up stuck a cabl into the main box and presto sound still the whatev attitud from the bartend 
time to order wine for my guy he ask for the wine list and the bartend brandon say should i pick one for you he say no ill pick it the guy pour my date a sip of red and shove it at him he is shock but tast it to be polit it is good so he say that good the cocki ass bartend say that whi im on this side of the bar and you are over there are you kid me 
for the rest of what is a veri excit game yes i watch and cheer the staff out number the custom and we sat and listen to how bad they want to go home and it suck for them to be there brandon the bartend was the biggest offend follow by that stuck on herself horrid red head server that they float around to all three restaur bitch and text the whole time we have to yell his name out to get more food or drink refil at least six time if he was not so into the game my date would have flip out and left you know the food is fabul here but the whole excit of the game was a bit dampen by such crappi servic i mean we didnt write the work schedul dude 
i look at it this way you are a bartend on a notori slow shift you onli work for tip do you piss off the few custom you do have or do you take extra good care of the one you have so you can make some money for you effort next year im have a parti or stay home
if i go back into the bar at richardson and brandon is there im leav for dick right awayi came here last night with some gfs to grab dinner and drink and watch the angel game  i guess i was on a subpar mexican kick after hit up 3 margarita for margarita shaker  the place itself is cute veri old school and i love the comment on the menu that say no cigar or pipe smoking
mi and the gir went to the bar becaus it playoff time and i need my angel fix  the bartend was realli nice and friend and was dote on us the whole time  love be a girl
w start off with chip and salsa which were just okay  the salsa tast veri sugari and was way to sweet for my like  the margarita werent anyth special as they have the sweet and sour mix flow for the soda gun
for dinner i got two fri shred beef taco  definit no street taco to be found here  how sad  the taco we big and pile with ton of shred lettuc and chees  yeahim just guess this isnt how it done in mexico  actual i know that not how it done
th portion were huge and id alreadi been fill up that sacr real estat in my stomach with booz and chip so i was onli abl to finish one taco
im glad i stop there becaus i was feel sick and greasi for the rest of the night  definit not a feel i enjoy  so even though the food was price well and the bartend was awesom the greasi food and lack of authent will stop me from come back on my own free willok so is this place 1star or 5¿  stop in here today just after 11 am for a first visit to find out  the first thing i notic was all the 100k car in the park lot  somehow that didnt seem to go with an old mexican restaur  the next surpris was that the place was alreadi get busi  they do have a loyal money clientel for whatev reason

ok so i step insid  it an oddbal place with a bar room as well as a regular dine room and an outdoor patio area  the whole place struck me as pretti boozi but credit that at least in part due to the fact that all of the other custom seem to be have mix drink for breakfast  uck  so anyway i ate in the regular dine room within which i wasnt complet comfort  im picki about seat locat  light  i just didnt end up with a booth that i liked

th food  short after i was seat a big bowl of chip  a cup of fair hot chunki style salsa arriv  both were delici  a second cup of salsa was cheer provid  i order a 2item combo with a nana chile relleno and a machaca shred beef hard shell taco

befor long my order land on the tabl attract place on a pipe hot platter  the relleno was unusu in that it wasnt bread  it was a medium size medium hot pablano stuf with oaxaca chees  top with a littl ranchero or cotija  it was good  the taco was big tasti  had a good amount of meat  both the refri bean  the spanish rice were super good  there was a bed of shred lettuc to mop up the platter with

for me this was a 4star meal serv in 2star comfort  the price was near the high end at 1050 but the food portion were excel and so was the servic      warn 
their wait staff will tell you on multipl occas that their sauc are not made with wheat flour  unfortun this is onli true some of the time  after break out in hive hour after eat here i call and spoke to the owner daughter  it turn out that sometim she use corn starch and sometim she use flour  wtf  the moral of the stori is either ask the owner everi time you come in or avoid the saucsutra no longer offer 50 off on tuesday night but barcelona does

so that where we found ourselv meet some friend tonight for dinner and drinks

it was a beauti even so we sat outsid on the patio  we went back and forth on use the heat lamp provid  chelsea was our server and she was sweet as can be but perhap a tad bit on the ditzi side  the guy seem to admir look at her bustier everi time she lean over the tabl and i was nervous someth was go to pop out

asid from that entertain the food was decent  it was not amaz  i had the chop salad which was pretti good and big enough to share follow by the sea bass no surpris there entre  jare had an 8 oz filet and zack had a ribey  we all share spinach and sweet potato fri as side and the guy each had dessert  i didnt have ani ahem  wed diet but they seem to be orgasm over the chocol lava cake the chees cake and berri dessert also went over well at the table

with the 50 off tuesday special this was 30 per person with tip  for the amount of food we got this was a deal but had we pay full price not so much 

if i return it will be on a tuesday night for the 12 off special  other than that im not realli interestno doubt that this is scottsdal ultim cougar den i end up here two night in a row becaus it has a huge outdoor area it easi to move around and hey if a cougar want sink her teeth into me and she hasnt escap from a geriatr home then i wont hold it against herit was a cold raini day my former roomi and i enter tbs store now stop right here i do not shop at tbs im tri to get to the restaur the store pahhhleeezeit look like the chang room for a bunch of magnum pis extra when i see the older white scottsdal men wear these hideous shirt tuck into their pleat khaki short and their tassl loafer i serious want cover them in burlap and throw them into a van that said i had a delici sea bass preced by perfect crab cake we down a bottl of pinot noir and wait for the storm to pass and wait and wait the dine room has window on three side and we felt as though we were wit a true bahaman hurrican although servic was great and the food was good all in all too overpr for what you got but the next time it monsoon im gonna ralli up the gang and head to tbs for some mai tai and to make fun of the tom selleck wanna besmacayo is yet anoth mexican place in the valley which is just right there on the line with what i consid averag mexican food there noth wrong with be averag it just isnt someth id want to be known for 

it the type of place where if you live close by itll probabl work in a pinch if your in the mood for mexican you just wont leav wow there noth wrong with the food it alright just not uniqu or fresh enough to realli caus you take notic compar there are place like rosa in mesa which have flavor dish that actual stand out and make you want to go back 

this locat has been pretti consist and the wait staff are fine i just cant justifi go here more than onc in a blue moon when there are quit a few other mexican place that have much healthier and flavor option for about the same priceive walk by red squar for year and alway want to give it a tri  last night befor the lionel richi concert was the perfect time

mi server was mari and she saw to it that i got my ice tea quick and she gave me plenti of time to look over the menu and then answer some question  for an appet i got the siberian nacho  this is a fun way of do nacho in a differ manner  there are five veri thin slicedwaffl potato chip each with a nice slice of veri good smoke salmon  top each is a small dollop of caviar and sour cream  the potato slice are so delic you cant pick up the chip and eat it with the salmon on top

th main cours had to be beef stroganoff  this was made differ than ive ever had befor but it was no less good  in fact this was the star of the meal and i recommend anyon eat here tri the stroganoff  it a brais short rib that was extrem tender accompani by wild mushroom tagliatell  there is some truffl flavor ricotta place between the pasta and the beef  unlik what we normal think of stroganoff this one was not heavi on sour cream to make a gravi for the beef  rather the ricotta simpli becom blend a bit with the veri good juic from the meat  i like their way of do stroganoff

i took mari advic for dessertit actual what i was go to order anyway  this was good but was a bit of a disappoint  the strawberri bake alaska wasnt made nor serv like a tradit bake alaska which could have been ok except for one thing  the base was a thin spong cake with some fresh strawberri slice  this was top with some strawberri ice cream and then the whole thing was moundednot with meringuebut with marshmallow fluff that had been brown  when i put my spoon to what i thought was meringu i learn by the veri thick consist how wrong i was  the marshmallow was overwhelm in textur and in sweet  i was glad to get below to the strawberri ice cream to offset some of the cloy sweetness

servic dure dinner was excel and mari was a veri pleasant server who made the dinner pleasant  the runner made sure my ice tea was refil as soon as i finish my glass

i like the room with it soviet theme  this start with the behead statu of vladimir i lenin at the entranc  the head was cut off and is in a freezer in the vodka tast loung where you get bottl servic  abov the door insid is cccp for the soviet union and there a hammer and sickl vodka vault sign by the bar and i could see part of the one mural in the barloung area about a delegatethat all i could read of the russian letter  while pass time between cours i did notic that on the wall abov the side of the bar they have misspel the russian word for squar in their red squar  perhap it the teacher in me and mayb it was my tough russian professor in undergradu school 

final the restaur is veri vibrantsound wise  i wouldnt plan on have a quiet convers with your tabl matespring restaur week 2013

this is onli my second time dine at a lagass place first time doesnt realli count went to lagass stadium at palazzo so i cant realli compar 

made a reserv thru open tabl for 5pm on a saturday we were seat right away as they had just open the ambianc is nice love the wine bottl display in the middl of the restaur our server immedi came over and introduc himself and took our drink order 

mi eye lit up when i saw the bread basket had pretzel bread in it joe stone crab is my other spot that i usual fill up on their pretzel bread who knew this would be the highlight of my meal actual my glass sauvignon blanc was a highlight anywho this is what i ordered

cold salmon tartarethi was good serv with flat bread good flavor

horseradish blue shrimp with cous cousthi was a huge let down the dish had no hint of horseradish at all it was more of a bbq tast than anyth els i believ it was isreali cous cous so they are a bit larger and have a slight differ textur than regular cous cous 

banana cream piei cant realli judg this as i guess im not a fan of banana cream pie my guess is if this is your thing it was probabl delici i was tri to be differ and order someth i wouldnt normal order

i dont see myself ever come back here or recommend to anyon to tri even if it rwemeril fish hous is locat along the concours to the mgm garden arena  the place is upscal and includ a full servic bar with some bar seat as well

servic was outstand here as there was a vip in our parti and the manag came over to say hello etc

w order the bbq salmon and whitefish along with some filet mignon medallion as an appet  the medallion are not on the menu  the filet medallion were serv with asparagus and mash potato  although tasti i felt the medallion were overcook as they were defin not melt in your mouth

th salmon was delici cook perfect but  was serv with some onion string that had lost all sens of crispycrunchi good therefor they becam a liabil on the plate

th whitefish was so mild i found it hard to find ani flavor in it  dont order the whitefish if you are hope for emeril baam flavoring

everyth was good here but again the price is a wee bit on the high side  i believ my salmon was 36 and came with no side  if you want to tri one of emeril place i would suggest the delmonico steakhous or perhap fish hous at lunch time as i have seen a lot of favor review for their lunch servic35 star 

new year eve at 3pm sat at the bar and we were serv immedi the bar server was veri help i order blue moon on tap and boy on an empti stomach it definit went to my head quick smile i order the hubert keller burger 20 with sweet patoto fri and my hubbi order an american kobe beef burger 16 not to be confus with the rossini kobe burger at 60 with truffl with ad choic of top  4 and a side of onion ring 

as i wait i notic that the restaur look like a comfi burger joint with booth and tabl the booth each had a mini flat screen so you can watch while you eat there are two bar area for those who do not want to wait for a tabl take a seat at the bar if you are hungri and want to be serv immedi 

mi burger came in a foccaccia bread with load of blue chees my first bite was great a mouth of chees tender meat and chewi bread i tast my hubbi burger and mine was definit the winner the hubbi kobe burger had lot of hard bit in it and that was surpris especi if it suppos to be a kobe burger

al in all a good experi but i still prefer the perfect burger at lbs at the red rock casino i want to say that i will come back here but even if my 20 huber keller burger is good it still doe not beat out the perfect burgerdinner on the strip and my t suggest the burger bar at mandalay bay  it my first visit at this hubert keller restaur and it busi on a saturday night  they dont take reserv and wont seat you until your whole parti is thereso hurri up peopl 

the six of us squeez into a booth where individu booth televis make this a veri sport bar friend atmosphere

if you notic im not the biggest burger fan so i end up with the vega vegan burger with buttermilk zucchini fri 12  sandwich between two portobello mushroom cap are grill roma tomato grill zucchini slice saute pepper and a roast eggplant slice  sure it pretti generous sandwich becaus they realli do load it up with veggi so youll get your fill on the vegetarian burger  the fri zucchini was pretti standard crispi and not soggi at all

th husband had the american kobe beef burger 1650 straight up  they ask if you want to add various fill like chees mushroom etc  but he stuck to just the beef so he could tast the meat itself  it was decent but noth special or worth the price  i guess what make this place special is all the top you can add  8 differ kind of chees lobster or shrimp foie gras chili black truffl or three differ sauc  all of these definit bring the price of your burger up though

servic was okay  we had to ask the waitress more than onc for extra ranch dress etc  it a busi place and with high back booth it hard to see your tables

overal been there onc and that enough  dont think a return visit is necessari at this pointover the weekend i realli want to tri this place i have alway love a good burger so instead of hit up the beach my friend and i decid to go to this place

th servic was realli good our waitress was veri attent to us as much as i want to like this place it not even that great 
i had the hubert keller favorit burger which was like 2200 buck the meat was realli tender and the spinach and sauc made it tast better but for 22 buck i was realli expect it to be like amaz but the meat wasnt that flavor to me i was realli disappoint in my burger mayb i just had too high of an expectation
mi friend got the chicken breast burger and it was a pretti good burger but for 15 buck i was kind of expect the chicken to be more juici and tender my friend also said it kind of plain so she took my sauc for my burger and put it on her the sweet potato fri were pretti good but it the same everywher els so it noth realli special
i also brought back togo my friend an american classic burger and she said it wasnt even that great for 15 bucks

mi friend like her burger and her experi here but as for me i dont think i will ever be come back here ive had better burger for the price of 5friend i know this fantast burger spot when we get to vega you have to tri the kobe beef
us alway up for good place to eat 
got to the burger bar got seat after a good 30 min wait staff was nice the place was clean floor is too slipperi girl with slipperi shoe be care no i didnt fall

start to look at the menu

friend well all have the kobe beef burger cook medium
m umm make that 2 kobe beef burger and 2 chicken sandwich me and the person i was with 

chicken sandwich was great and i am no longer friend with the friend he did not like someon not let him have control over their choic oh wellthis was my first time to burger bar and onli knew of this place from yelp and iron friend from out of town most of my yelp bud gave burger bar good rate so i knew a meat feast was inevit   shawn h put out a uye for burger bar and i took advantag of this opportun keep in mind that burger bar is locat insid mandalay bay  most restaur tend to cost a littl more in a casino on the strip  but at burger bar price are fair cheap consid it locat  burger bar has a huge select and you can also creat your own burger  these are all great call out for a burger joint but first thing first i need to point out is that this visit was dure lent in which red meat is current be sidelin second i dont drink much  so my review might not be a fair one at the moment becaus i am not review burger bar for what they are known for which is a burger and a bar  

this visit and rate is for their servic and their salmon burger the salmon burger is huge at a half pound and prepar medium well price is about 10 which is a good start howev i felt that tast was lack and the salmon patti was dri i know salmon isnt flavor in the first place but i have had tasti salmon burger at other restaur ie halphen red in san diego  sinc i was eat 8 oz of this stuff i at least got about 40 gram of protein and omega 3s  in all i was disappoint with my salmon burger 

the servic is pretti good consid that our parti was fair big  burger bar is veri accommod and the staff is excel  you can say that the servic almost cancel out the poor tast of the salmon burger  i have not given up on burger bar i still have their real burger to tri and base on what other yelper have state alreadi this is what they are known for 

ps  this was a shawn hs uye  i had a great time with other yelp friend  thank again shawn for put this togethi have been to burger bar on a number of occas over the year and have never realli been blown away by the burger 

on this particular occas we were here for happi hour servic was great from start to finish pleasant and extrem attent by sever differ server and bartend the drink were good as well price were right and i stuck with the strawberri mojito on special while my fella got a beer as well as a mai tai that he enjoy for the most part the happi hour food was les than stellar the wing were probabl the highlight but they were a littl dri and lack in ani real spice the chicken tender were sad and were similar to one we could get at denni the slider were the least appet of everyth we order lack in flavor and after one bite i wasnt interest in eat ani more

i have had some good burger here in the past but noth particular noteworthi i do rememb enjoy their side quit a bit and after a relat lacklust happi hour we end our meal with the cheesecak burger that end up salvag our whole dine experi not the best donut ive ever had but the combin of cheesecak and fruit nestl insid a glaze donut bun was the perfect end to our mealif it werent for the terribl serviceyoud be at 45 star mesa grill

y im talk about you john j  we stop in last saturday for their brunch menu and i all of us were astonish at how lack the servic was 

but let me talk about the good eat first
two of us order the mesa burger which was excel one mediumon medium rare both of which were grill spot on
two of us order the chicken hash which was anoth good choic and an interest combin of flavor  the grit that were serv with it were some of the best ive ever had our burger were serv with fri which while werent bad pale in comparison to the duck fat fri we had the night befor at stripsteak

th extra they provid a complimentari assort bread basket which is well down and was scarf down by us quick  three of us tri differ margarita which were excel 

whi servic was terribleveri slow we had to wave down server on more than one occas if we were taken care of whi would we ever have to do this one person who had just order a diet pepsi was out of drink for a while until we had to flag someon down for a refil at 4 a soda we expect a refil  our server actual start talk onc befor ever get to our tabl couldnt hear him and start walk away while i was talk to him kinda rude buddi especi if your serv at a restaur of this calib 

the total for the four of us exclud tip was 12215everi time i walk by mesa grill i thought about tri it  i final made it here last sunday  the restaur is big and modern  becaus it was sunday at 1130am we were told brunch was serv  

the brunch menu was kind of limit  httpwwwmesagrillcomlasvegaspdfmesalvbrunch010810pdf  we decid on the following

1  tiger shrimp tamal with cream corn not on the abov menu  16 httpwwwyelpcombizphotosxzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhgselectbzdgak4kyiolojnnm9giia this was quit good  im not a fan of tamal but i enjoy the cream corn and the shrimp total of 4  

2  ancho chilehoney glaze salmon in spici black bean sauc  roast jalapeno crema  22 httpwwwyelpcombizphotosxzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhgselectzzxiymivp3o1osnjdf4hfg i order it well done  the salmon was veri tender with good flavor  howev it must have sat on the counter for awhil bc it was bare lukewarm  

3  new mexican spice pork tenderloin sandwich grill red onion arugula anchochil mayonnais  southwestern fri  16 httpwwwyelpcombizphotosxzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhgselectqq6qbo2cmswdd7l9owudaw this was the biggest disappoint of the meal  my fianc gave it 1 star  enough said  

servic was spotti  at first it was realli good but then it just went down hill  like i said earlier our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhil bc my salmon was bare lukewarm and my fianc sandwich the pork tenderloin was cold and hard  our ice tea were get refil until we were done eat  then they took the plate away and didnt bother ask if we would like anoth refil  cmon even if were done we might still like some more ice tea

i thought the qualiti and servic didnt measur up to my expect and the price  3 star is all it geti was veri excit to tri mesa grill becaus it a bobbi flay restaur he may be cocki but hes a versatil chef and his food alway seem veri flavor im also a huge fan of celebr chef and michelin star restaur 

first of all servic wise i didnt feel that it was anyth special the waiter came by took our order and stop by to ask how everyth was while drop the check off it wasnt horribl servic but i felt that it could have been better

w ordered
smok chicken and black bean quesadilla
goat chees queso fundido 
new mexican spice rub pork tenderloin
pan sear chilean sea bass with poblano chile and sweet onion relish
roast hack chicken
salmon not sure how it was season etc 

it also came with 3 select of bread  blue corn muffin asiago bread and walnut raisin bread i enjoy the blue corn muffin that had to be one of the better bread in the basket it had a nice flavor and there were actual bit of corn in there which was nice i also enjoy the asiago bread but would have like a stronger chees flavor to it

food wise i veri much enjoy the smoke chicken and black bean quesadilla it was crispi and flavor wise everyth work veri well im not too crazi about bean but i ate this dish happili for the main dish the best dish was my friend chicken i rare order chicken dish when i dine out becaus it easi to cook at home and id rather tri someth more adventur howev after tri our dish the fianc and i order the pork and sea bass we regret not order the chicken

i was veri disappoint with the pork tenderloin and chilean sea bass mesa grill is known for it pork dish and even though the textur was soft the flavor just didnt seem right it also had a veri odd after tast which was disappoint the sea bass was also noth special it was cook veri well but i wasnt crazi about the flavor and it had a veri fishi after tast 

mi fianc and i both agre that we probabl wouldnt come back here it wasnt to our like and there are sever other restaur wed rather dine atdear bobby

i just want to let you know that mesa grill is no longer my favorit restaur in lv on my most recent visit last week in which dh drop over 100 on dinner for two we left unimpress and unsatisfi with our meal the best thing i ate that night were the corn bread free sweet potato tamal and roast corn side everyth els was kind of an upset

w had high hope for the blue corn pancak appet but the lacklust barbequ duck was mask by the overpow habanerostar anis sauc for entre i had the new mexican spice rub pork tenderloin which despit be huge and tender was noth memor dh had the yucatan style grouper which was light but bland where was the southwestern bam

ther are hundr of other nice restaur on the strip at which we can throw our money next time were take our busi to mastro ocean club at least then we could have the novel experi of eat in a tree house

ltive watch bobbi flay on televis for a long time and have been on the fenc about him and his food  howev given his success ive want to give his food a chance

th brunch menu at mesa grill was a bit limit  i order the scrambl egg chilaquil with roast tomatillo sauc white cheddar chees and creme fraich  the scrambl egg were fluffi and not overcook  the tomatillo sauc had a nice background heat that didnt overpow the sauc  the egg sat atop blue corn tortilla that surpris maintain their textur and didnt disintegr while cut  

the present and flavor were just good noth extraordinari  the portion was a littl on the smallish side  

i recommend you tri their partida margarita which was notabl but go elswher for foodfallen michelin star

ther are some peopl who dont bobbi flay becaus he seem to be cocki let not forget hes classic train and becaus of that hes one of the few celebr chef in food network who give great cook tip i went here becaus this was the onli michelin star that he ever earn this restaur is no longer a michelin star michelin no longer doe star rate on las vega restaur ive eaten at a number of michelin star restaur but ive eaten at restaur that were at that time were michelin star rate but no longer has a star fleur de lys and alexand steakhous so eat here would provid me a good comparison to restaur that are current michelin star rate and those who were in the past

i ate here last night the menu is straightforward a la cart unlik the trendi tast menu my server recommend the signatur dish is the new mexico pork tenderloin he also said mesa is known for their margarita i had two item that i plan to order i alway see flay mention about blue corn there were two blue corn item 1 blue corn pancak 2 blue corn lobster taco  at the suggest of my server i order the lobster tacos

th mesa grill margarita arriv befor ani of my dish it was a refresh drink to start with the first dish was the lobster taco for 20 i was disappoint there are 3 mini taco in a blue corn shell you can tast the spice and lobster howev i couldnt tast the blue corn i should have order the blue corn pancak the entre which is the signatur dish of mesa grill new mexico pork tenderloin was a tastier dish than the lobster taco this is one of the more underr spiciest dish i ever had there are the medallion that are cover in spice eat this dish take a while to finish but in do so you enjoy each pork medallion which was moist and tender i decid not to order dessert

so what was the verdict when i go a fine dine restaur i want to learn what it cuisin is about mesa is suppos to be known for southwest flavor howev when i ate here last night i never understood what southwest flavor were from other michelin star restaur ive eaten i learn and understood what their cuisin was two prime exampl are two restaur in san francisco boulevard and aziza when i ate at boulevard i understood what california cuisin is when i ate at aziza i understood what moroccan cuisin is but to be fair to mesa in comparison to other former michelin star restaur mesa is better than fleur de lys san francisco but not as good as alexand steakhous cupertino i think a 3star rate in my book is fair

wil i eat at mesa again mayb howev i regret not order the blue corn pancak and chile relleno if i did mayb rate would be differ who know in the futur if michelin would start rate las vega restaur  if michelin doe i cant see mesa garner it star back at the momentoverrated

i made my way over here on a sunday afternoon to see what this buzz was all about and realli there was no way sophia could have ever live up to the hype the way peopl were talk about it i expect to fall out of my chair in some kind of tasteinduc seizur what i got was a pretti standard brunch in a pretti uncomfort chair posit awkward on the curb 5 feet from truck and mope hurl by and drown out my conversation

i do rememb the croissant  chees be excel but i can hard even recal what els i ate  never a good sign the black bean taco were good in the sens that they were authent but they were serious lack someth to give it a littl more flavor juic was not realli that outstand potato were justpotato noth about them that made them special all in all i had a pretti decent meal for an an accept price i just fail to see whi i should pick it over marigold or sunroom or ani other place that has a respect dine room


you dont exact look like your lack in a fan base right now so whi is it that you cant put a littl more money into this place sophia is everi wannab hipster wet dream and east johnson isnt exact the most divers neighborhood in madison as for me i dont much enjoy eat in an establish whose everi aspect of outward appear and servic indic that it think it better than me 



im much remind of the oatmeal how to make a restaur insan popular in a big citi and base off of the sophia model ive decid to put a littl guid togeth that work specif for madison see you on the cover of forbes

1 onli accept cash if your custom ask whether you accept credit look at them as if they just ask you for a milkshak made of liquefi puppies

2 pick a ridicul small venu that could not possibl accommod the amount of custom you have make them wait in a line out the door to get their food and have them fight over and share what littl tabl space there is this will give everyon the impress that they need you not that you need them

3 keep your restaur open for 10 hour a week it maxim the line open and shut your door so quick that youll be the envi of everi bank and post offic in town

4 air condit in 100degre weather is for pussi who think a restaur owe them someth your custom are onli give you their money not their firstborn children

5 4560 minut is not an unreason amount of time for them to wait for your food delici food take time so what if everi upscal fivestar restaur in town can get a full meal on the tabl in the durat of twenti minutes

6 if there are 4 custom in the front wait to place their order and an interest convers go on in the back rememb where your prioriti lie that chees plate appet that been sit there for the last 25 minut will still be a chees plate if you bring it out with the main course

so if you like your breakfast as pretenti as you like your music your cloth and your onegear bicycl your go to fuck love sophiai barf in das boot at essen haus

they sell shirt here that say someth along the line of i had a boot at essen haus i would have bought total bought one of those shirt but onli if it had my more accur titl shirt from above

seri fun serious shtti beer serious polka mad serious subpar service

i might be spoil by live so close to best damn german bar ever httpwwwyelpcombizthebavarianlodgelislehridmtbzump3hutduzdquma but judg from the just abov 3 star averag i still had an on par averag experi but a boot was involv sooo yay  puke becaus i realli want to be the one to finish it off but that would have defo meant me barf in the boot which is appar my faux pas 

i love beer im all for twink short jortsand lederhosen and as if i even had to mention the polka bc ya know im down for some squeezebox and then some but essen haus beyond be a mad citi tourist attract is just okay still a must see if in the area i cant say much for the food beyond the peanut and popcorn imma have mayjah sodium face manana but the beer select is pretti much just shtti german import and the servic goe like this

serv what do you want

server okay sign for 75 deposit if you break the glass on top of the 25 boot
serv drop off boot

serv anoth boot
you i hate you 
server bring check

i dont hate it im happi i went this one time im more happi i didnt barf in the bootsomeon els paid so i shouldnt complainbut i wont let that stop me 

harvest is one of those place with tini silli portion that come on a plate squiggl with butternutrosemarygoat teatpear seed reduct perhap i am a complet plebeian midwestern but after 3 cours i left not full  and unimpress with the food

th food was interest it was complex it was intellectu it was edgi it was not yummi from appet to main cours to dessert there is noth i tast that i would ever care to have again it sort of like if your date some pretenti film student who make you sit through all these gem of swedish cinema and your think peopl do not watch these movi unless other peopl tell them they should becaus they are without emot power the food at harvest is like that veri headi without senorsi attract would other peopl covet it so if it wasnt so wide covet 

the servic was veri great the meal was well pace and we were abl to have a long relax convers i realiz that this is one reason that peopl go to realli expens restaur  it would be nice if the food were an attract tooi have to say i was a littl disappoint  okay i dont have to say it but i will say it  had lunch here a few week ago when it had final stop rain  everyon seem to be on the patio so that where i felt we should be to get the most out of the a z88 experi  the beauti peopl crowd must have still been primp or sleep becaus they were nowher to be seen  that fine  i find i look much better sit next to an ugli person anyway

i went with the portobello mushroom sandwich with onion tomato and crispi fri potato  the tomato werent quit ripe and the potato just tast like an overbrown potato chip  doe anyon rememb laura scudder crappi chip  kinda like that

th waffl fri howev were fantast  usual im not a fan of the waffl fri as they are usual undercook or overcook  but these were just right

i had no complaint about servic and the restaur is nice  i just thought the food should have been better  i wouldnt mind give it anoth shot and order someth differ thoughthis place is pretti cool we stop by here realli quick on our way out of the mall and decid to grab a drink and a snack i have been here befor but it been a few year so i was excit to tri it again i love the way this place is decor it all deck out as if you were in the rainforest huge fish tank vine leav tree bush rain even animatron anim it quit the place we sat at the bar and their barstool are actual form into differ anim which is a veri cool idea we decid on a few drink and end up order an appet to share the chees stick we had were veri good nice and crispi on the outsid and the chees was warm and gooey on the insid the marinara had a lot of kick to it it a realli basic dish but i cant tell you how mani place i have been to where the chees stick are hard the chees isnt melt or gooey and marinara tast like water down tomato soup

th staff was veri friend the atmospher was realli cool it was a nice place to grab a quick bite i cant wait to come back and tri a main dish and sit back in the restaur where all the action animatron arewent here with some friend while my husband and i were have our coupl shower in vega prior to our wed his best man rave about the restaur so we decid to give it a go

w made a reserv for the first seat but they werent quit readi for us when we got there so we sat in the bar area and order a coupl of drink i got a veri good pino noir though i cant recal where it was from

when it was time to be seat we were escort to our tabl through a line of wait staff honest it was a bit uncomfort walk through all those peopl onc we got to our tabl our server came over and gave us menus both the server and her assist were pleasant enough though i dont know i would go as far as say there were friendly

w all order our starter and make cours plus a coupl of side i got the lobster bisqu which i wasnt all that impress with i had better lobster bisqu on cruis ship it was a bit salti and the way they present it was a bit tacki in my opinion

when the entre came everyth was fine the steak was good but i dont know that i would ever pay 50 for it again i ask for medium and i got medium rare which was fine for me but one of my friend had the same problem and it kinda gross her out so she had to send it back the server got the problem fix veri quick and it was perfect the second time around

i did like that they came with some sauc the bearnais was veri good and my husband devour the peppercorn sauc the side were all good but not as big as we had anticip our waiter said they should feed 34 peopl howev when you have two 250 pound guy with you it was not enough

th dessert were fantast i had the creme brule which was perfect soft and creami with a yummi hard shell on the top i would order that again in a heart beat and we all felt the desert were veri reason price for what we receiv definit big enough for 2 peopl to share

overal 3 start everyth was good and probabl would have gotten 4 star if not for the price of everyth when you pay that much for food you expect to be wow and we just werent but no major complaint eitherit my birthday and i want mussel  mon ami gabi has them and off we go on a veri hot sunday afternoon  we immedi ask if we could sit outsid and the hostess is quick to tell us there is no shade whatsoev if we choos to sit out there  hmmit like over a hundr degre today  so we decid to sit insid but as we are head out i notic a hand of peopl sit in the blaze heat and we decid to go for it  smack dab in the middl of the patio and perfect for peoplewatching

it a quick peek at the menu and were set to go  water arriv short along with warm french baguett and butter  the bread and butter is so good and just so french  yum

our food soon arrives
 mussel marinier with frite 2195 full order  load with ton of onion we start dig in  one of my favorit thing about eat mussel is the yummi sauc that come with it perfect for dip warm french bread into  what i dont like is find the beard still attach to the mussel  sure i can let one go  but there were at least four mussel were i was spit the beard out  yuck  the frite are usual one of my favorit part too but i wasnt dig their version here  it more like deepfri potato sticks

   counti style pate cornichon whole grain mustard countri toast 995  the pate was just okay noth spectacular  you take a piec of pate and put it on the countri bread and take a bite  have a cornichon too while your at it  but it wasnt someth that transport me back to the french countryside

our waiter also forgot the husband kronenbourg which requir a bit of reminding

servic was good in the begin with our water glass be fill often and more baguett come our way  then i think there was a shift chang becaus all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check  we also notic that we didnt get ani kind of dip sauc for our frite but notic other tabl automat got ketchup  i would have been happi with mayo

overal i guess i was expect more  from the servic and the food  everyon rave about this place and i was left feel underwhelm  the locat is perfect and if you sit outsid it fabul for peopl watch and the bellagio water fountain show  perhap ill go again and further explor their menumon ami did not live up to the expect form from a previous visithad dinner here a coupl of year agoand the food was veri good i had the french onion soup and skatemi friend had a salad hanger steak and friesthi time around i was a bit let down by the qualitytast of the food and servicealbeit it was veri busybut they do have a huge number of staff member that should be equip to handl larg crowdsmayb it was just a bad day

french onion soup  wasnt quit warm enough the chees was start to harden a bit and thought it could have use a bit of sherry

consid my great first experi here the delici endiv salad and the locationconvenienceim go to give mon ami 3 starwhat i love about this place is that when i had breakfast at street side we were abl to escap the smokefil casino and the bustl pace of the citi  we were just abl to calm down and enjoy a nice breakfast

i order a green omelett with spinach and gruyer chees  my friend order quich lorrain and egg benedict  the egg benedict was the best dish of the three  the other two item were kind of lack in flavor  cost of entre for breakfast run between 8 and 15  definit not bad

qual of the food was mere okayeveryth was good but noth was impress  regardless the locat was great and our server was pretti sweet   but becaus noth realli impress me i dont know if id come back to put down more money for lunch and dinner entre  but it a cool place to come for breakfastand to escap the strip without leav ithave mon ami gabi bookmark for awhil i final got the chanc to come by dure my compani vacat last decemb we didnt have reserv as i want to sit in the outdoor patio which is serv on a first come basi we were told the wait would be rough an hour and were surpris to be seat after 20 or so minutes

if your plan to sit outdoor be prepar for veri tight and cramp seat the patio is a popular choic and it like the restaur want to maxim the space and squeez as mani tabl in there as possibl but the view of the bellagio fountain slight make it all worth it one extra star for the view

i start off with their st germain cocktail 15 which was light sweet and refresh and onion soup gratin 11 which was bake with gruyer chees it was heavi and veri flavor but i couldnt finish it sinc it was too salti while my egg benedict 15 consist of canadian bacon it was veri standard and unmemor the rest of my parti had the grill salmon  spinach salad 20 and main lobster roll 18 which seem to be fair mediocr as well

th servic left a lot to be desir our server was veri friend and outgo but couldnt be found half the time mayb it was becaus it was busi but we seem to wait forev for everyth even small requests

not too sure if id come back unless im in the mood for a bougi al fresco lunch with bellagio fountain music play in the background everi 15minut if you want decent food for the same price you might be better off at grand lux café

p whos gabii guess this is where those who get reject by tao comejk 

after that horribl experi at tao we stumbl across this place  we saw a short line form outsid the entranc and hesit sinc we no longer bear to stand in our 3 inch high heel  but we were in vega for a bachelorett parti and our todo list had to be complet check off befor the night was over  we inquir about a tabl servic with the hostess and it turn out to be much more econom than we had anticip 200 a bottl with minimum of 2 bottl  

this barloung is small but has enough sit area along the wall  the dj was spin top 40 song and occasion michael jackson cmon billi jean is a classic  our tabl servic was more than adequ and suffici as they constant brought new glass and clean the area for us  

i like that this place had enough light  this help us tremend when we were pick guy to help us accomplish the mission on that todo list sinc they were chosen pure base on their look if the bachelorett had to take a bodi shot look mattertrust meok i am a vip to this hotel and i will tell you nowthi hotel is not for everyon but for those with a budget sahara is one of the oldest hotel with the tropicana it doe not have the glamor of citycent or the luxuri of wynn hotel it may have been luxuri back in the 50s but were now in 2010 

the sahara hotel has a veri old park lot and you will notic that you will have to drive through the garag with caution our car are bigger than those of the past some carstruck will block a lane and one car can go through while the other wait depend where you park be warn the north side park garag elev are broken if you enter from vega blvd those elev work

i walk in and i use the vip line while there is a long line wait for their room unfortun they did not have ani balconi room avail they assign me the tunisa tower room 806 it is a simpl small room room are just simpl dont expect too much from this place dont expect pari hilton or wayn bradi show up here

mi room was free and free has no complaint i had no problem and i use it as a backup room if anyon complain then you should go pay more for the wynn hotel

hav fun here and keep yelppeppermil ah peppermil not quit sure what kind of a theme they were go for here but it definit scream tacki 

the menu is reminisc of much pricier denni or norm but the size are at least consider larger  

servic is just alright noth to write home about in fact i think the waitress forgot my friend egg egg how do you forgot egg when it the most common denomin in each menu item 

i order chicken fri steak and egg and split that with my buddi who got rib yep rib so mani it isnt just a glorifi denni after all 

oh and who need alcohol when you can get a tall cup full of hot cocoa with a heap shitton of whip cream hmmmmmm whip cream on top of more whip cream

th chicken fri steak was decent egg and tater were done well the rib were disappoint meat wasnt tender at all and it was swim in bbq sauc probabl to mask that concretetextur meat and it came with fri rice like chines style fri rice what the heck was go on with that

i was told the egg benedict were good i cant comment caus im general not a fan and therefor didnt bother to tri it  i also didnt get to check out the high acclaim club part of the diner lol firepit and loveseat  mayb id give it a higher rate if i had check that area out

bottomlin not bad for late eat but a bit heavi on the walletnumber of visit 1

would i come back if i was realli hungri and there was nowher els to eat 

i guess the reason whi this place is rate high is becaus of the interest loung that attach to it it open 247 and the portion are generous it basic an upscal denni 

food consumption

corn beef hash it averag noth great noth bad noth excit about it 25 stars

pancak 3 ginorm pancak order with the size bigger than my hand it similar to one you would get at denni tast like flour egg and water doesnt melt in your mouth i guess that whi they give  you huge serv of margarin and syrup caus you know theyr not serv you real butter 15 stars

noth much els to say about this place it was pack on a saturday morn with hungri peopl the servic was oka in our server was friend but other employe i may have ask someth for were noti have been to the boa steakhous in santa monica befor  i gave boa in santa monica 3 star too becaus they couldnt cook the meat right their wagyu steak was too dri and their side were too salti but their ambianc is great httpwwwyelpcomuserdetailsreviewsearchuseridepakqfjljztmlascrtfhqqboa 

boa steakhous in caesar palac was a complet opposit  the ambianc was horribl seat was uncomfort and the light was too strong it near blind us  servic was pretti laid back for a steakhous which i dont mind but a littl more attent wouldnt hurt

but the steak were cook perfect  it was tasti and juici mmmmmmmmm i order a medium rare and the steak was perfect medium rare from the tip to the middl to the end  polish up the interior and with better servic this restaur could potenti be 5 stars

start prawn it was pretti good httpstaticpxyelpcombphotozdimdk6zhlmdukaoob20al

steak yummay httpstaticpxyelpcombphoto4uoyscaybg9c8ld9ppwysif your go to have kobe beef you might as well go for broke and do the tast menu here it was an awesom valu for the amount of food includ my husband and i share 4 app 2 salad like thing the hawaiian prawn sweet and butteri and a charcuteri platter for the side we were given mash potato kinda runni and pasti saute mushroom and grill asparagus and for the meat oh babi the meatkob fillet and sirloin cook and season perfect it was truli one of the most succul meal weve had in a long time yeah sure the side and salad could be consid forgett and how can a meat and potato place actual mess up mash potato but realli compar to how the food scene was in vega 10 year ago this place could be consid fantast 

but i did say could so here my beef haha get it the dessert ill rememb this becaus it just seem so off we got monkey bread with caramel sauc the bread was not golden enough in fact it look kinda anem in the dark lit dine room molten chocol cake hohum i might as well have gotten a vanilla creme brule sorbet and gelato quartet  no firework here and a slice asian pear that right slice not even nice slice with the seed still in it and no it wasnt even poach someth definit fell short in the kitchen

mi other beef is the servic my biggest pet peev so this is how it usual goe server welcom you in give you a menu talk you up and complet sell you on the experi that you are about to have they get you your order get your drink even go next door to anoth restaur to get you a bottl of sake becaus they dont carri ani and onc they drop the entre the main event it like a black hole sudden appear in the middl of the dine room where did the server go is that him oop my bad that was just an illus it kinda look like him but he keep disappear and act so uninterest in you that it cant be him my advic to server is this follow through with your diner man you could have made up for the bad dessert experi if you even bother to check if we want coffe 

so sad to say it was a good and bad experi i would have love to give this place 4 star becaus the beef was just so amaz this place definit suffer from bad servic despit the fact that our guy was nice enough to go next door for us to get us some sakehad a few friend visit from out of town this weekend so we decid to get togeth for dinner here  the better half  i have been here onc back in juli 2007  we didnt realli care for it then but decid to give it anoth shot

i order the filet  she order the salmon  the tabl split a bunch of side dish fri creami potato spinach mushroom  pea risotto asparagus potato au gratin  my filet was cook to my like but it was underwhelm  the flavor was good but it was miss somethingit didnt make me want more  wifey enjoy her salmon but said it wasnt great  the side were underwhelm tooth potato au gratin were veri runni the highlight was the fries

i split a buffalo mozzarella salad with a friend of mine for an appet  it was too soft  runni for my tastes

th best part about dinner was the wine  we had a magnum of 2005 faust cabernet sauvignon which was excel  it had a nice bold flavor and had hint of blackberri  a slight pepperi tast to it  it went well with the steak

overal the experi was underwhelm  certain not worth the 355 for wifey  i  weve had much better dinner for much less

wil we return  unless someon els pay for it probabl notive been to a lot of amaz steakhous in las vegas

craftsteak just didnt do it for me it not that they serv bad food other than serv me a medium steak when i order medium rare it just that at this price point about 200person it should be absolut except and everyth was just averag 

the onli real plus to the place is the nois level wasnt over the top so you could conduct a littl busi dure the meal without effortafter scope yelp we decid this would be our fanci vega dinner  while we dress up other peopl were just wear tshirt  par for the cours in this city

th place is big warm decor and dim lit  onc you pass a bar with televis you enter the main dine room

our server was great  an older friend talkat guy  he told us the menu chang everi day depend on what produc their supplier buy that morn in california

you start with complimentari hot butter salt roll in a skillet  these were outstanding

i order the 16 oz new york strip steak grill  this was a massiv piec of meat  i order it medium rare but it came out entir pink  our server pick up the steak and summon a new one  unfortun this meant my girl would have to eat while i wait  when i got my new steak it seem closer to medium rare but it was straightup cold in the middl  not want to wait for a third steak i just ate it  fair middleoftheroad

for side we order the maui onion which my girlfriend love  they were a nice addit to ani fork full of steak  we also order the potato gratin  sad they tast fair bland  we need salt to bring them up to par

anoth deduct a photograph came around to snap sever pictur of us  about 15 minut later she return with book of photo she tri to sell us for someth like 130  we didnt see her snap pictur of ani other coupl  noth like have to shoot down a sale pitch in the middl of a fanci dinner

whil i like the atmospher and our server the food fell short  i realli wish id enjoy it morefor be a restaur insid a hotel this spot is worth check out  it almost 4 star but the food is just too damn expens for what it is

cool point for be insid the hard rock hotel and maintain the rocker vibe while still have a mexican restaur feel  i love the open air patio that overlook the pool and how the door are open so there is a breez insid the restaur more cool point for make fresh tortilla for everyon to see

th chip and salsa come with 3 type of salsa  and they are all pretti good  my chicken fajita were veri good at 15 but the portion was kinda small

but hey let face it  dont we all want to tri out a place call pink taco   good job with the name market peopl  their pink taco cloth is pretti popular too  i notic a lot of peopl come in to purchas their apparel

fin cool point for see carey hart and joel madden while we were there

if i say cool one more time in this review i am go to make myself sick  i need a thesaurusim from the san francisco bay area and want to experi a thoma keller restaur  it imposs to get a reserv at the french laundri and sinc i was go to be in vega over the 4th of juli weekend i thought i would tri bouchon bistro  i had heard wonder thing about this restaur go back to season one episod seven of no reservationson of anthoni bourdain show on the food network  i got a reserv immediatelyand mayb that should have been my first clue that someth was wrong

a friend and i went to the restaur on monday 7609 a littl after 6 pm  we were immedi seat and the waiter brought us warm pistachio nut with our bread and butter  everyth look pristin and exact what i would expect from a fine dine establish  howev the place was empti except for a few diner seat near the window  i just assum we were earli and everyon dine late in vegas

w came to enjoy fine cuisin and to be thrill by thoma keller reput and didnt hesit to order the most  expens item on the menuth grand plateau for 110 plus a side order of french friesa dish bourdain claim was better than his own  we figur these two were their signatur dish and had to be the best boy were we wrong

th french fri were good but not spectacular  shoe string potato fri serv in a paper cone is pretti common these day at least in the san francisco bay area  it hard to judg a restaur sole on their fri so we wait for our grand plateau

when the seafood tower arriv we sampl the raw oyster and clam  they were fresh and sweet  then we move onto the cook seafood  we tri the jumbo prawn and were taken aback  the shrimp were meati but had no flavor and were bone chill cold  next we move onto the dung crab  a fresh crab should have opaqu flake of sweet meat  the crab we were serv had a dens meat and absolut no flavor  ditto for the lobster  in fact the lobster tail tast water log  the mussel also tast a littl weaklik mussel at half strength

i mention this to the manag and he suggest that perhap i didnt understand the textur of east coast crab or lobster sinc i was from the bay area  he also told me that the chef steam the seafood and it was never plung in ice water  despit the manag and chef assur my palat knew better  the seafood tast like it had been prep in advanc and store in a veri cold refriger  perhap it had even gotten partial frozen and that soggi water log textur was actual the melt ice crystals

i grew up on fresh seafood  my father use to work in restaur and he would buy the fresh catch of the day in san francisco chinatown and my famili would wake up each morn to a seafood breakfast fit for a king  my father best dish were jumbo prawn burst with roe in steam egg with green onion and of cours the simpl crack crab  my father never overcook his seafood and we ate our crab without ani sauc becaus we want to savor the sweet of the meat

you can imagin how disappoint we were when we were serv bouchon interpret of fresh seafood  in hindsight it obvious they had probabl stock up on seafood for the 4th of juli holiday and i was experienc seafood that had arriv sever day earlier  also sinc it was over 100 degre in las vega it hard to keep seafood super fresh  go back to anthoni bourdain book kitchen confidenti never order seafood on monday especi if it special that fish probabl was deliv on thursday in anticip of busi friday and saturday night dinner if it hasnt been eaten by sunday night it becom monday special

frank i was more insult by the manag and chef who tri to convinc us that our palat were wrong rather than admit their food was not the freshest  it unforgiv to blame the custom for the restaur fail  the manag never apolog or even offer us a complimentari glass of wine or dessert  when i got back to the offic i told everyon about our experi and believ me most of my cowork will think twice befor choos a thoma keller establish in the futur  his food doe not live up to his reput and im afraid in these tough econom time he has lower his standard  if bouchon had ever been upscal it has truli gone downhilhazel qmi apolog for the lack of review late  i got a new job recent and have been quit busi  ill tri my best to keep up in the future

w paid a visit to bouchon becaus we heard great thing about their brunch  although my memori a bit fuzzi sever year back i did dine there and do rememb the food to be quit good

mi goal was to tri 2 thing the brioch and their french fri  their brioch becaus the instant you step foot into bouchon your slap in the face by the smell of fresh high qualiti brioch  the aroma is heaven  their fri becaus anthoni bourdain said so

with this in mind i decid on the croqu madam  it basic a fanci french egg benedict but with brioch and morney sauc instead  it also came with a side of pomm frite a fanci term for french fri  becaus everyth is so fanci you end up pay fanci price  and if you pay fanci price you expect to get fanci tast food and fanci service

th croqu madam was good  everyth came togeth nice  the ham was savori the egg perfect cook the morney sauc was rich and creami and the brioch was butteri with a flaki crunchi crust  veri fanci  now mr bourdain about their fri  it was way too salti for me  i still think mcdonald and innout have better pomm frite  but sinc im a pig the salti didnt stop me from eat everi singl stick

perhap our waiter was have a bad day but he was absolut horrend  it seem like he brain was on vacat  while the other waiterswaitress were hustl tri to provid speedi fanci servic our waiter was stroll around like he was in a museum  and he was so freak ineffici  my wife order coffe and he would bring coffe no cream or sugar  after we ask for cream and sugar hell just bring the cream and 5 minut later the sugar  my butt cheek were flex becaus he was make me so antsi  our brunch end up take 25 hour  i dont care so much about the time but if im dish out 20 per plate for breakfast i want better servic  that not too unreason rightim not gonna lie i wasnt realli impress i just expect more from mr thoma keller of threestar michelin french laundri fame

mayb it was brunch mayb it was vega or mayb it was just meyoung idealist demand and incap of be blown away anymor we began with a chocol croissant which was too flaki for my love for dough then the bakeri was out of raspberri beignet at 11am on a sunday
 
next we had the steak frite and an omelett with homemad sausag broccoli rabe and chees a special yes the steak and fri were enjoy but 3350 for a flat iron and fri realli yes the omelett was fluffi but 16 for beaten egg realli anthoni bourdain said restaur mark up food by 300this was more like 600

mr keller has fallen a littl in my eye but im sure a trip to the french laundri will remedi that im accept date there right now if anyon is interestwas in vega dure labor day weekend and to my glee it lv restaur week too i saw todd english on top chef as a judg and with the locat just on the edg of the lake of the bellagio fountain i was in  made a reserv the day befor hope to get the first seat we score a tabl on the patio and got to watch a fountain show cool food roundup 3 cours lunch for 20

bread basket yummi flatbread and carmel onion focaccia with green and black oliv tapenad with whole oliv as well one of the tastier bread basket ive had

appet of watermelon panzanella and calamari the panzanella is a bread salad nice and big red and yellow watermelon cube on top of mix green with oliv feta chees and big cube of toast bread watermelon was tasti and pair nice with the salti chees the calamari was nice and crunchi but came with this creami aoli on top wouldv like someth with more acid to balanc it out

entré of chicken breast with black lentil hummus and grill lamb chop the chicken was a tad dri but came on this bed of huge thick cut meati and sweet tomato veri nice the black lentil hummus was yummi nice lemoni kick but warm and a bit thinner than usual hummus the lamb chop were veri tasti with some type of bubbl glaze i ate these up the fatoush salad on the side was nice complement

dessert of season sorbet trio and drunk chocol trifl the sorbet were a nice and i realli like the orang look one probabl passionfruit the bf didnt think there was enough chocol in the trifl there was onli some chocol ganach at the bottom i thought it was just ok

lowdown it all about the view sinc it sit on outsid of the bellagio fountain lake make an earli reserv and sit on the patio weekend water show start at noon breathtak as far as the food it had some good flavor and with this price veri reason cheaper than brunch buffet normal price though wouldnt go some problem with here and there with execut there probabl mani restaur that are better at this price rang especi in lv do go for the view thoughive dine at quit a few las vega cafe and must say that mr lucki is one of my favorites

i particular like the wild turkey sandwich with a side of slaw in lieu of fri for 1199  it a turkey sandwich on grill sourdough both cheddar and jack chees mushroom 1000 island dress and a lil kick with some jalapeno  yum

that said the servic was excel and friendlybut that could be the result of our prefer for sit at the bar when we hit place like thisth bartend is alway more engaged
th patio and happi hour are realli the reason to go to the bungalow never had dinner or lunch insid so this isnt a dead of winter or heat of summer kind of place for me the ambianc insid just doesnt make me feel comfortablehigh nois level echo aroundit sound like a boiler room in thereyou know what i mean
i just go for the patio and usual just for happi hour
but happi hour is enough to give these guy a solid 3 to 35 star sorri bungalowi am not a round up kind of reviewerearn that extra 12 star
carin had a marti bar vodka is skyy so that was nice and i had a scotch bar scotch is dewar so not so nice fortun they have ice at the bungalow i can drink the barrel scrape from the age cask in osaka that they use for suntori scotch if i have enough iceit was pleasant enough they dont have a huge select of fine singl malt there anyway

th bungalow an inexpens 27 befor tip and entertain dinner and showas a chicago girl i know a thing or two about pizza  while roman candl doe some thing well i had a few issues

first the deliveri was fast free and the deliveri guy was super nice and profession  the pizza crust was a good balanc between ultra thin crust and deep dish  they dont go too crazi on the top and the menu give ton of option for specialti pizzas

howev the pizza arriv how shall i say less than hot  kinda luke warm  and just so you know when you microwav wood fire pizza they lose their magic  also roman candl is on the pricey side  31 plus tip for two medium pizza seem a bit excessive

perhap next time im in the area ill tri dine inpregam purchas 2 groupon at 2 for 98  walk for an hour with our friend at seven hill on the trail to prepar  eric r ran

gam time arriv at balli for 1130 am reserv  wait at standingon cocktail tabl to be seat almost took til 12 pm  we sat down at our tabl set for 2 we had 4 in the parti in the vip section and were ignor for 20 minut  ton of staff walk by but the server kept tell us our waiter was in the back and would be out veri short  in that time a server brought the tabl set for the other 2 peopl  the other server saw our frustrat or my impati rather and final fill up our water and champagn glass and offer orang juic  the tabl order 3 juic and a busser brought them out  bloodi mari are also includ eric had one

w sat so we could give our server the groupon but he never came so final the other server who gave us drink told us to go eat  i went to the cold section first  the buffet is rather small compar to other buffet on the strip though it cost retail 34 time more  we had just been to the m and thought 40 was high and their select is quit larg  here there is a teeni sushi counter and you have to ask for each piec which is uncomfort  i got 2 spici tuna roll piec and 2 piec of tako nigiri  then i ask for caviar it is not offer verbal to you there got my blini and condiment and move on  i got smoke salmon and some oyster pretti larg and some goat chees and toast  that was my first round  when i got to the tabl the server who brought tabl set admit he was our server and apolog for the wait claim he brought the orang juic that the busser brought befor he show uphmmm  eric ask for a bread basket and off he went

th food was good  they had pretzel roll in the basket  i most had goat cheesesmok salmoncaviarcondi with the bread and blini and toast to start  the oyster i had were realli good with a squeez of lemon  then i went for hot food  my friend had seen duck but when i went there they were out  the chef said they had to go find duck at the pari and bring it back  i got the veri last lamb chop at the cut board keep in mind they are open til 3 then got a beef sope to share with eric sope tough beef delici and spici  the lamb chop i got was sooo delici and actual cook i had a raw one at caesar bacchan  see pic i post on that page  the breakfasti stuff did not appeal to me so i went back for more of the caviar smoke salmon and sushi  then for dessert i had a banana foster crepe yummi and the whip cream was vanilla scent and tasty

i then got up to go to the bathroom outsid of the restaur  when i came back my friend acquir me some duck that magic appear veri tasti and eric r said he saw the sushi chef with a plate of sashimi hidden behind the counter that she was onli share with certain guest  he had to ask for it sinc it was not on display  this is a bit sketchi to me  he end up with 2 piec each of tuna salmon and yellowtail which was cut veri generous and he share a littl with me  i wish they had offer that all along  the whole set up of the sushicaviar area seem restrict and made me feel a bit awkward ask for each thing but it was realli 14th of the savori item available

in the end this was definit a onc in a lifetim experi  definit pricey for the small buffet even with the groupon  i suppos peopl feel it is worth it to pay for the perrierjouet champagn  it was neat to come here and see eric happi with lobster tail and my friend happi with king crab leg and snow crab claw etc but the option are limit  the servic also was a bit frustrat sinc it seem everyon got wait on but us at the begin and from reserv to be seat to get some servic took probabl around 45 minut  we did tip on the retail amount  women get a long stem rose on the way out of the restaur and men get a handshak  no one rush us from the tabl to finish though so that was good  

postgam walk the strip for over 4 hour after the meal show our friend 7 more properti sinc one had never been to vegaif you feel you must experi some semblanc of oktoberfest while your in vega this is the place my friend and i found ourselv here after we notic that the british pub firkin on paradis was no longer in busi we figur we could at least grab some cold german beer and comfort food here and that what we got they have all your wurst and schnitzel here i got the schnitzel that wasnt all bread and fri and i thought it was pretti good but like most other item on the menu a bit overpr id been here onc befor just to grab a cold brew and it surpris that they dont have a lot of differ beer here there onli a few varieti if memori serv i just went with a lager which was a refresh accompani to my hearti meal we were kept entertain dure the meal by the oneman band play his heart out on the stage not onli did he keep the music go he got the audienc to particip in a steinhold contest which was pretti damn impress i must say our waitress was friend but a bit lax when it came to check on us even though it wasnt superbusi at the time overal a solid ok if your in the mood for this kind of thingeveryon has an off night i do you do the waiter did this night i went for the first time on a weeknight there wasnt much of a wait but we went for the communal tabl i realli dont like high tabl but this one was comfort enough i was actual duli impress by their beer selectionyoung doubl chocol stout on draftim in their beer menu impress me far more than their food menu which is understand be i am vegetarian in a burger place my beer was delici if a bit too cold for my like and we got our order in steve just want fri me and our other companion share an order of mix fri plain and sweet potato and i went for the grill veget panini sinc i couldnt have ani of the chees sandwich option their capres salad look good but at a buck more i thought their sandwich option was a much better deal and i need some carb to weigh down the high alcoh content of the premium beers

first our fri camebut all not as we order an confus they left confus we were confus but then they came back with right balancecart whatev then our sandwich it was pretti hefti took a bite and thoughtweird that chees is realli smokey garlicki and chewey i put it down and said that exact phrase out loud then look at it close chicken vegetablechicken when order i havent had chicken in over 10 year that how confus i was by the tast and textur i got the waiter explain it had chicken and that i was vegetarian i wait while they got me a nice veggi onebi that time my companion had finish their food practic and my beer was almost gone and i was a tad cranki the sandwich was delcious and a real deal at 8 buck we didnt order anoth beer bc i wasnt happi about have my chicken cherri pop but he didnt charg me for the food and gave us an addit discount and apolog so you can see the mix feel i have regard our experi and alsoth fri were not memor i thought the plain fri were actual kind of garlicki and had a strang metal aftertastebut i did like the dip sauc i will def stop by here for late night eat or to drink their amaz select of beerat the barah delux you littl fanci hamburg joint that must have a corpor account at ikea or someth becaus that place is chalk full of swedish furnitur ani how this place is pretti fun it open till 2 in the morn which is a big plus in my book the tap beer is extens but in a beer snob way it kinda bore it remind me of the father offic im sure they rip the shop cart thing from them but it all gravi if you like fanci burger at 2 in the morn than go getcha some soni was so complet readi to love delux i had been wait to tri it for a reaaaaalli lonnnng time and was excit to make the littl trek down camelback and give it a go prereview context it was a friday night and it was veri busi 

mi boyfriend and i roll up into the strip mall park lot and spent a solid 5 minut hunt for a space and not just you know drive around look for one i mean competit space hunt horn were honk i becam a littl afraid an ulcer was form after find a spot some distanc away we walk up and in to the trendi blue dark of the restaur 

the whole place was almost complet full includ the outsid patio area which is where i realli wouldv like to sit  octob you are final here but i wasnt mad at em good for them a frosti hostess seat us at the barstyl tabl in the center of the restaur and stalk away i think we interrupt her composit of a text messag whatev ladi 

the tabl we sat at is probabl exact the place i wouldv least like to sit while it is you know cool and lit from beneath by fluoresc blue light i felt veri cramp in between the parti to our left and right they werent be loud or obnoxi and i even felt they were be conserv with their elbow all the same it was not a comfort fit plus my man and i prefer to sit next to each other when we go out i knowi know we also like to convers dure dinner and sinc we could bare hear one anoth over the din this would probabl be the kind of place id go with a group of tipsi friend rather than on a date night 

in contrast to the disgruntl hostess our server was veri sweet and pleasant she was friend and patient with us as we made our drink decis and also remain unobtrus attent for our meal my boyfriend was excit to see that they had sierra nevada on draft i order a french vanilla martini which i chump out on and couldnt finish this from a girl who use to order three long island at oncei think my heart crack a littl to wit myself so far remov from my former glori 

we share an order of mix fri a la cart cart get it get it veri cute present but i think i wouldv been more tickl if i didnt know it was come 

know this i am a sweet potato fri maniac in fact delux sweet potato fri were realli the big reason i want to give it a go i had anticip them for month and they were just okay in fact both varieti of fri were just okay and i also didnt realli see ani reason to rant and rave and yelp about the ketchup or the aioli the latter which i feel i make a better version of at home so yes i was happi to munch on some sweet potato fri but it not like wing sprout from my back or anyth upon touch the first golden fri to my lip my boyfriend said they were fine which is his stock answer for assess the qualiti of anyth that isnt a beer or an action movi 

mi boyfriend got some random burger and i had the turkey burger i agre with the sever review that have whine for more season pleas on the turkey burger let face it  the nobl turkey is one blandass bird it requir a heavi hand a smackdown of spice and season my turkey burger seem to get someth more akin to a pat on the head although i did still enjoy it especi with the creami sauc that came alongsid my boyfriend enjoy his burger but prefer the origin hamburg work oh well appar the fanci present what is this stuff was his respons to the julien carrot garnish wasnt enough to compet with the sheer grung of ohw 

it was easi to pay our bill and leav i know peopl complain about this sometim  you will not have to complain here 

we will probabl go back id like to tri one of the real burger and my boyfriend has mention the great beer select sever time sinc our visit it wasnt a bad experienceit just wasnt all that and a cart of frii feel like a racist when i eat here  mayb it the panda bear dress as pancho villa  mayb it the rest of the name chino bandido takeeoute  mayb it the fact that i giggl when i saw both  i dont know  i just feel bad about it

that said the food is actual pretti good  it certain wont blow your mind but get a chines chicken dish with spanish rice is an experi to savor  the snickerdoodl is cool too  one big drawback  an incompar confus order system that leav even mensa mind with a headach  

for better or wors this is a restaur that has never heard the word nonever been here i have live on this side of town for over 10 year for some reason drive by this place never made me want to stop here that circl k corner just never appeal to me well everyon talk about this place so i final broke down last week the park lot was pack so i felt good go in 

everyon seem pretti cheeri and the guy who help me didnt seem to mind that he had to explain everyth to me i end up order chile relleno burro w the tijuana veggi quesadilla bean and rice i was surpris there was no mexican rice on the menu anyway my friend tri the machaca in a burro overal noth stood out to me as fabul this trip not with the food sorri 

the relleno was nice and crispi with good heat to it but no flavor i tri the machaca and it was nice cook but pretti flavorless as well bean were bean i have a feel the mexican food here just isnt great and i am will to come back and tri the chines next time on the other hand i found that all the hot phx firemen grab lunch here and that alon will probabl get me here again veri soon i feel safer eat just in case i forget how to chew and need to be save with some mouth to mouth not sure what happen to chino bandido late but they were a 4  star rate and they have drop to 25  3 star rate at best here late due to poor consist  this is an asianmexican fusion restaur local own and has two locat  they are one of the best gutbomb place to go when your crave someth differ  like chines food cook like mexican food and vice versa  chino  is veri reason price food pack with flavor

you can get a chile relleno egg foo yung in a burrito jade chicken on a quesadilla fri rice and black bean all on the same plate if that what your crave  

even though im a meat eater i recommend their veggi quesadilla  it one of the best thing on their menu  it pack with veggi and chees in a crisp hot tortilla  dip that bad boy in their hot sauc and have some fun  i use to love their polo diablo and jade chicken but they were both cook to death so i had to buri them both befor their time in the trash  this was after i finish my jerk fri rice with carnita x 2  

this place is veri reason in price veri uniqu and it a dive  but there is such a thing as be too divei and dirti so pleas think about your custom and invest some time and money into clean up a bit pleas  

sure their order process need to be revamp and they need to cook their food more consist and the clean thing alreadi mention but they have with out a doubt the best snicker doodl and chocol lava cooki around 

those darn cooki will keep me come back in hope they can execut everyth mention abov better in the futuri heard thing about this buffet but mayb those thing were onli true a while back  31 for a champagn brunch where they dont allow you to substitut some peach pure for the orang juic becaus you are allerg to orangeswhatev  it was good time raid the fruit section to tri champagn with cut up melon and it was veri nice of aj to muttl some fresh strawberri for us to use in our champagn  im surpris they didnt stop us and charg us 12 extra for it

th food option were decent but it wasnt as great as it had been made out to be  i like have some fresh egg made for me so i could top off my janki version of egg benedict that consist of wheat toast slice prime rib countri gravi and two egg over medium  the scrambl egg were either runni or veri dri  the french toast was a bit on the dri side  the bacon was realli good  i should have ad that to my janki benedict

th atmosphere

  clean 
  not too much traffic around the buffet station manag to get in and out

overal a 35  i would not mind come back if i want a decent breakfast with some dinner selectthis is so disappoint at 50 a person for holiday  the qualiti and tast should be better way better  the price has gone up and qualiti has gone down

aft an hour wait in line we were so readi to eat the food look good and appet but when i put it in my mouth it was just so disappoint too hard too tough tast bland yes all the above

duck prime rib duck leg lamb king crab leg cocktail shrimp sushi and everyth els a high end buffet has dessert were averag my favorit was the cheesecake
i dont see an huge differ in the item between a regular dinner menu and a holiday gourmet dinner which is about ten dollar more then the usualdisclaim i do not eat seafood if you are a huge seafood fan this place will definit be a 4 star mayb even a 5 star for you 

the buffet at the bellagio is veri veri seafood heavi i realiz a lot of peopl love this aspect and my boyfriend definit enjoy his king crab leg sashimi and other seafood dish but even for him this was not the best buffet experi 

overal i thought it was a bit small there wasnt a plethora of option and overal i was not impress with most of the food that i tri 

i did enjoy the prime rib which i was excit about the turkey and mash potato were pretti good too the asian and italian dish were all aw and i tri multipl one the pizza did not look appeal at all 

the save grace was the taco bar and the dessert option i especi enjoy the chocol eclair and tiramisu 

also despit the locat at bellagio i felt that the buffet decor was a bit date and i was not impress with it 

servic was good though and the price was reason all in all though i wouldnt go back if you are a fan of seafood though i would suggest check it outthe wait is not as bad as it use to be the food is alway fresh i like that when i have them make me a spici tuna handrol i can ask for littl or no rice they serv the crab leg here over ice but you can have them heat it up for you there alway a decent varieti of dessert i would say that this place did get boot from one of my favorit buffet spot ever sinc bacchan open i would stick to onli go here for dinner becaus the lunch select is pretti limit server are alway great i cant say the same about the front of hous staff

dur one of our visit in june 12 i roll up in a group of 10 and the rude hostess her name was marlen was annoy that we had a line pass to bypass the line i was stay at mgm that time and they somehow accid delet my card on file dure checkin so i had issu charg to the room which rude marlen start taunt me about and talk shit yes i may look young and we may have look like broke punkass kid but fuck you bitch i quick shut her up when i just decid to pay the entir bill in cash it was brought to the attent of a manag but there was no followup so im not sure if rude marlen was reprimand or noton a trip a few month back sever taxi driver independ of each other all answer the planet hollywood buffet when we ask them what they thought the best buffet in vega was  sad on that trip we onli went to the bellagio  i fix that on this trip out

w went for a late lunch on sunday and found that no matter what time you go to a buffet they are alway hoppin with busi  for about 27 you will be given countless option for food  i had some of the steam shrimp a coupl of thing from the asian station surpris to see some dumpl there and even more surpris that they were pretti good a coupl of thing from the carv station bbq beef was moist and not dri out the prime rib had a wonder spice edg and a few thing from the middl eastern station some hummus eggplant and tabbouleh  everyth i tri was good and i was care to grab onli a spoonful

dessert was simpl  a help of some damn good bread pud with a shot of vanilla soft serv ice cream on top  niiiiice

ther a lot of food choic here bring a cot or sleep bag if you canok so this use to be my favorit buffet year ago when i was a tourist in vega  but now im a local and also a vegetarian so i realli dont eat at the buffet except when friend are in town  well wouldnt you know it we had some friend in town recent and they want to go to spice market buffet  i honest was pretti excit becaus i now had an excus to come back

so i dont know if im jade as a local or if it becaus my choic are sever limit sinc i cant eat 95 of the item but im never realli impress with buffet anymor  spice market howev is still pretti good option in my option  my friend nonvegetarian were happi with their meal

a ani vegetarian in vega know your choic at a buffet are veri starch and dairyheavi and spice market is no except  i had quesadilla pasta with pesto sauc mac n chees and whip potato  they did offer simpl green bean and even some realli yummi roast veggi asparagus zucchini onion in the italian section  the middl eastern section has sever vegfriend choic but be weari of the moroccan veget they had realli bad season and textur  i enjoy the dessert but then again i alway enjoy the dessert  the fruit tart and cream puff were my favorite

oth thing you can expect includ shrimp soup breadstick pizza fajita sever bread and spread sweet potato cotton candi and a dessert crepe station

i think this is still a solid buffet especi as a tourist  the price are reason for a buffet on the strip and i even found a coupon onlin for 5 off httpwwwdestinationcouponscomnevadalasvegasspicemarketbuffetspicemarketbuffetcouponsasp  vegetarian you can find enough to eat here includ a decent salad bar that i didnt even touch  vegan i would say you need to avoid all buffet too much dairi  everyon els there are ton of choic includ prime rib and crab leg you will leav stufthe burger here was delici  that burger and all the other food would get at least a 45 star rate from me which is impress becaus i am often a bit of a snob when it come to ground beef patti  whi the three star review then the aw aw aw servic and complet confus  let go back to the beginning

w went to the old fashion for 2 for 1 burger night  we had a 30 minut wait but we were abl to get spot at the bar  we love the ambianc of the place i was beyond happi with my 250 beer of the month  while i had ask to close out our bar tab a bill never came in the 20 minut of wait for it  when the hostess call our name i left some cash on the bar in hope that it cover our tab  after we were seat this continu to go downhill

it took a while for our server to come and he was realli confus by our order  two of us got the 30 the other two got the 31  those are the two burger option on the menu so obvious it was rather appar that we were there for 2 for 1 burger night  he ask each of us what we want on the side and we had the option of salad or fri  fair easi right  wrong

our food came and mine was the onli order that wasnt complet mess up  everyon els had question thing with there meal and the end up have to take everyth back and rearrang it all  i was a littl confus becaus myself and my other friend who got the 30 had massiv side wherea our friend that order 31s got side that were normal portions

when our bill came there was some serious confus  those of us who had order 30s got 2 for 1 burger the 31s were normal price  but those of us who had order 30s were charg for our side while the menu say that all burgerssandwich come with the choic of fri or salad appar that doesnt alway appli  displeased

th reason i got so frustrat with the bill is that we obvious were tri to take advantag of the deal  the server easili could have told us that onli certain burger were 2 for 1 and that if you got those burger they didnt come with side but you could order some to share which i would have done  it was the first time in a veri long time that i didnt tip at least 20

go here for the food but dont expect good servici know it was you fredo you broke my heart you broke my heart

thi review is a realli tough one to write  i use love the old fashion  hunka hunka burnin love sort of love  but then you chang and broke my heart sob

in the begin it was oh so magic  in the day befor 45 minut wait time the servic was impecc the food sublim and ambianc allur  you were great at so mani thing lunch with a cowork dinner with the kid a late night bite with my better half

but as you becam more popular thing state to slip  the server becam less attent as they dealt with the never end throng of custom  not onli did it take longer to be seat but it was take longer and longer to get the food i order get refil on drink or get the check when i need to rush out to get tot a show  then here was that time when my tabl was plagu by a swarm of fli think amityvill horror  when the server joke about the problem instead of take care of it i knew it just wasnt go to work for us anymore

and about the foodit has slip as well  the chees curd that could have launch a 1000 ship start come out greasi more time than not  or they wouldnt arriv at the tabl pipe hot  ditto for the haystack onion ring  the allur of the grill chees sandwich also fade as the bacon would show up undercook or they chef would skimp on the roast red pepper horror of horror 

while nearbi restaur like graze nostrano and osteria papavero continu to innov and improv you seem content to rest on your laurels

so i hate to say it but fredo your noth to me now your not a brother your not a friend i dont want to know you or what you dothe whole grill fish  loma larga wine is worth go there for  everyth els was okay includ servic  overal the price was a bit high for what you getsteve wynn is a radic vegan these day so all his restaur featur vegan option i am most definit not a veganbut i like to tri new stuff so a friend took me out for a littl sampl one night we start with appet here and then walk across the hall to lakesid for our entre see my other review

i had also been here onc for dinner at which time i had steak i dont rememb much about that previous meal other than the fact that the place seem overbear full of itself and was main patron by the bever hill botox gang also my boyfriend at the time had to lie and pretend he was a client of his a high roller who was stay at the wynnotherwis they were book up and werent abl to accommod us so sorri yeahit that kind of place

but anyhoo this time my friend and i had a reserv and just order cocktail and appetizersal from the vegan menu we had a sort of mold quinoa salad that was fantast plus a butternut squash soup with cilantro that was faaaabul we also had some croquett that were made from some weird meatsubstitut that tast like whatev it is they put in croquett peasant fetus or someth know the kind of peopl who dine here everyth was delici and the waiter and host staff were courteous and friend even though we were onli have app and not rack up a huge check bonus point to them for that

ala i fcked up the vegan theme by eat the bacon cornbread muffin from the bread basket the waiter didnt offer to bring us a vegan bread basket which they did later at lakesidejust the regular shtick which was the usual holi triniti of breadbasket pretzel bread cranberri bread and bacon muffin

atmospherewis this is sort of a mix between those clubbi oldschool steakhous and the hip new douchey kind of steakhous mute color palett sort of countryclub bland i think some kind of equal bland diana kralltyp jazz play in the background boister laughter from the redfac captain of industri at the tabl around us chortl over their latest acquisit and tax evas  a few cranki old coupl in ralph lauren and st john minc their steak in the grimfac silenc that onli come with decad of miser coexist with someon you hate but marri becaus of their pedigre and the lifestyl they were abl to provid you you knowthos kind of peopl eat here

honest unless you want swanki vegan food and even then i dont realli see much to recommend here as it is veri expens and not all that excit of a scene butif the last time you slept with your steeltitan husband was dure the reagan administr and your grandson just crash the jaguar you bought him as a graduat gift and you regular clean out the la mer counter at bendel in a hopeless quest to regain your tennisplay youth and firm up your wither jowlsyou just might dig this jointi recent was in las vega for a convent in the mgms convent center  i was amazedw check in sunday night and although we work ate drank gambl drank more etcw did not leav the mgm until thursday nightwth

mi buddi and i tri to hit up the happi hour at seablu but a lack of seat at the bar mix with a pair of empti stomach just wasnt workin out therei swore i wasnt go to go there but it was a peak dine hour and we werent go to eat unlessdammit here goes

a step away from the bougi of the mgmthere rest diego  casual dine this is not nobhil nor latelieryou will not be eat a 16cours tast menu or enjoy a lobster pot pie lobster corndog etcno this is diego

hav you ever thought about what it would be like if a kenyan vegetarian rework the menu at el torito  no well think about itit would still be food but it wouldnt realli be mexican would it  well that how i feel about diegoit food but it not realli mexican at all

you know that salad that you get on the side of your plate at most whitewash mexican place  usual crappi iceberg lettuc and some carrot shave i tend eat around iti order some chicken enchilada think it gotta be the least disappoint thing on the menu  ugh my food is buri under this lettucewth  scrape the lettuc away and you see what it was hide blah

servic was goodcom enjoy the beer and the chip  salsacom becaus the wait is too long everywher els come becaus your starv but not becaus your hope to tri the mgms uniqu twist on mexican foodit is what it isi came here with my friend to grab a late breakfastlunch  i ate here mayb five year ago and i rememb it was pretti good  you place your order at the window and you can go grab a tabl while you wait for your crepe to be made  it usual take about five minut or so depend on how busi they are

i went with the fruit de mer httpstaticpxyelpcombphotoz1163pz9vogyg4hawdxrkwl  which had shrimp scallop mushroom swiss chees and bechamel sauc  it tast like the seafood was frozen and the bechamel sauc didnt have much flavor  i had a bite of my friend toulous which had a marinara sauc and that was much tastier  

i also got a cup of coffe here and after a while i notic my cup was slowli leak from the bottom  they were nice enough to give me a fresh cup of coffe which i then burn my tongu on  p

if you come here go for the dessert crepe or the toulous  im not a fan of their bechamel sauc but the other stuff is good review of their upstair more formal dine area 

it was one of those night where we should have just stay home it would have been a much cheaper and probabl more satisfi night than dine out unfortun we decid to eat out be big fan of both top chef master and rick moonen we dine in the upstair area at rm seafood room

ther no doubt that the food is creativ uniqu and artist present but i thought the flavor were hit or miss we each got the five cours prix fix menu for 75 yeah seem like they rais it recent from 65

amus bouche
watermelon twoway with crab meat delici light and refreshing

first course
th steak and potato beef tartar with crispi strip of potato on top were great my favorit dish of the night the seafood bouillabaiss look cool and the individu compon were good but the gelé had a sweet tast that didnt compliment the seafood in my opinion

second course
th custardlik textur of the onion soup was interest but compar to other onion soup the flavor could have been stronger the green egg and ham dish is beauti and when you get the right amount of ham egg noodl and asparagus in one bite the salti tast is entic but when all the ingredi start to mix togeth it start look like babi food and lose some of it appeal

third course
both the walu and roast fluke were solid dish with the fluke be the better of the two the walu was flaki butteri and veri meati but the flavor were too subtle

fourth course
w both got the china pig for our 4th cours my wife wasnt a fan of it at all but i thought the flavor were veri intens and the skin had a crispi qualiti to it that remind me of lechón my parent would have love the tast of this dish the chewi of the fat was a nice contrast to the skin but i can see how this dish might not appeal to everyone

fifth course
th dessert were decent but unspectacular the chocol car bomb was creativ but again the flavor just wasnt on par with the look of it the tropic creme brule had the consist of melt ice cream with piec of fruit at the bottom it was an odd dish that had me wish i had tri the italian citrus instead

most of the dish were larg forgett with the steak and potato and the china pig be the onli one that i would want to eat again that surpris consid seafood is this restaur specialti im all for tri new and invent dish but if the flavor dont even come close to match their tradit counterpart the onion soup and creme brule for exampl it leav me disappointed

and what about the servic well like the food it was hit or miss if you get up to use the restroom dure your meal the staff will retriev the person napkin and replac it with a new fold one but when my wife got up they took her away and didnt bother to replac it until we ask for a new one i order a beer which the waiter pour tablesid accord to the waiter their protocol prohibit them from tilt the glass when it be pour so if the waiter isnt experienc at pour beer with the glass flat on the tabl the result is a lot of head needless to say i got a lot of head but not the good kind haha so much so that my beer overflow and i had to ask for a new one i dont know if tabl are wait on by team of waiter but that what we experienc we saw our main waiter a coupl time and three or four other waiter throughout the night most were friend and knowledg the sommeli was excel he definit knew his wine and did a great job of pair wine with each dish

i knew have a five cours dinner would take a while but i had no idea how loooonnnngggg it would be everyth just seem to take a long time  from get drink to the amount of time between cours look around the dine room i saw a few other coupl who look bore out of their mind like they were forc to watch cspan for the whole day so mayb we werent the onli one suffer from slow servic threeplus hour later our dinner was final over i had to flag anoth waiter down to let him know we were readi for the check we didnt have ani of their complimentari tea and bare sampl the petit four befor head out i realli want to love this place im still a fan of rick moonen he wasnt there that night and think he should have won top chef master i was hope rm seafood room would leav me want more but instead i just want to leav35 star i realli want to round up to 4 but just cant do it  love the atmospher and servic even love a coupl dish but not enough to round up  i had high hope and sad rm didnt deliver

w dine upstair and start in the loung with some champagn and oyster  the gm paul was veri friend and chat us up right away  he came back to check on us a bit more as we enjoy our nibbl  while i have no doubt that he is a friend nice guy im sure anoth reason he spent so much time with us was the lack of custom elsewher in the restaur for the most part anyway  

the oyster were incred fresh and tasti as expect  they arent cheap for sure  at 375an oyster ive never paid more not at daniel boulud and not even at provid  the champagn was also a bit pricey at 25 buck a glass but prosecco would not have work  the loung is comfort but overlook the throng of peopl roam about mandalay bay  it a bit jar to be in such a fine dine atmospher but to watch the antithesi just outsid a window

w adjourn to our tabl to begin the tast menu  servic was great  three differ server work with us answer our question and maintain the same friend atmospher we experienc in the loung  i went with the tast 75 and the wine pair 55 jim g went with the tast and a drink  the food

gril octopus sad too rubberi and lack in flavor  i think ive learn that if im not at osteria mozza im not order octopus
steak and potato prime beef tartar cornichon potato and other yummi i cant rememb  the menu say untradit garnish  surpris good  so simpl but well put togeth and great quality
green egg and ham andraki farm egg jamon serrano and asparagus three way super yummi  interest flavor and great combin  cute presentation
hot and cold foie gras a la japonn 15 supplement best dish of the night  on one side of the plate there was a lush piec of foie gras sear perfect serv on top of crispi sushi rice heaven  on the other side a cold mouss of foie gras nestl underneath a beauti piec of uni sea urchin  ridicul so good can i have two  actual it too rich to eat two but still  there was also a palatecleans shot type thing that came with it total gross  
we had the walu and the alaskan salmon  they were ok noth special sadly
w then had the china pig and rabbit trio 15 supplement  also ok well prepar but noth amaz  the morel risotto that came with the rabbit was veri nice though
for dessert we had the irish car bomb guin ice cream bailey ice cream beer sud and chocol pop rock and the frozen strawberri shortcak bar nitro dot marin strawberri and spearmint  the car bomb was good but more interest as an idea than as a dessert  the strawberri shortcak bar was super good  it tast like the good humor bar mani of us had as kid  i did find it odd that a fine dine establish was tri to replic a 75 cent bar we bought from the ice cream man as kid  it was good though 

we end with an interest tea present  there was a caraf with what look lime lemongrass on our tabl  water and dri ice was ad for a cool effect liter and figur  the cold tea was tasti and refresh particular after such a fill meal

again great servic and innov cuisin  howev the tast didnt quit match up with the ambit or the price  i respect chef moonen for onli use sustain fish and for be creativ with food but for the same price i can have much better food  ultim that has to be my gaug for my reviewmy famili and i dine at rm seafood on christma of 2009 this review is long overdu even though this meal was near five year ago i rememb it to be quit pleasant and enjoy although incred overpr i have no recollect of what my father or i order but i do rememb my sister order the blt iceberg salad current price at 14 and at the age of 14 she was surpris when a giant chunk of iceberg lettuc was place in front of her and she realiz she had to eat the salad with a knife and fork my mom had gotten the main lobster which was market price and around 80 at that time even though it was delici my mom realiz she could get the same main lobster over at red white  blue for almost half the price at 50 sinc rwb is no longer open i guess if we ever stay at mandalay bay again were go to have to go to rm seafood for good albeit pricey lobsterthe red white and blue restaur is a cafe insid mandalay bay we stroll in on a sunday even to have a relax meal befor our flight and we got all that we want and more i ask for a tabl outsid which is to say it is outsid the main build of the restaur but not outsid at all

 i order a small caesar salad and the french onion soup the salad was fresh crunchi and delici i wasnt a fan of the stale bread piec on the side of the salad i would have prefer a slice of bread or crouton but the salad itself was still delici the french onion soup had a massiv 1 inch think layer of chees cover it which made it visual appeal but problemat to get to the soup i suggest a jackhamm rental prior to order the soup i still enjoy the soup though it was veri good i just had to work for it while i avoid 95 of the chees i would still order it again the broth was complex and not like averag french onion soup 

while the red white and blue restaur isnt the kind of place to grab a quick bite it make for fun peopl watch the restaur is locat along the main walkway for peopl come and go from hotel so you have lot of entertain from drunk and disord to complet wed partitomato and mozzarella  fresh mozzarella tomato pesto and balsam glaze on focaccia which came with a bag chip  for a whop 12

soda separ price 

get super busi at lunch time and line are long 

i like the sandwich but i doubt id get it again it was veri soggi and the balsam tast a bit funki think there was just too much of itown by cheesecak factori we figur it was sketchi at best 

but decent for a quick lunch befor an afternoon of shop surpris it was actual quit good ahi tuna burger rare the way i ask and qualiti tuna wasabi cream on the side side salad subd instead of fri and it had amaz yummi bleu chees on itand a light dressing

breadooohhh tri the wheat deliv warm to your tabl you slather on the butter and think your in heaven okay servic lot of ice tea refil and fab girli convowelcom to vegalocat insid the venetian is the grand lux cafe you cant miss it it is right by the escal lead up to park lot where valet is done i would describ grand lux cafe as a upscal cheesecak factori but a littl bit more expens it seem that everi singl time that i am in vega i end up here from prior experi i would have rate this place a 45 star but it did not meet my expect this time around it will definit make me hesit whether or not i would want to dine here the next time around did my eager and excit for this place final die 

we arriv and sit in a booth in the bar area becaus we want to watch the laker game that was on 

be in the mood for a burger i order the max burger which had certifi angus beef top with cheddar chees applewood smoke bacon saute mushroom onion and roast short rib with fri it was good but not good where i was jump with joy 

our waitress jina was on pms the whole night 

she was rude and the gf kept notic it i was pay attent to the game so i dont know what exact was go on i can tell you what i heard from the gf though she was work as if she hate her job and did not want to be there she would roll her eye whenev we want some more water drink etc she was throw some of our dish onto the tabl she was tell us to move our drink out of the way in a rude way so she could set down our dish she was fat she was ugli she was jinanoth say we realli just want you to eat at the buffet like beverag price that approach 50 of the cost of the buffet  after order orang juic and coffe i could not in good conscienc have order anyth off the menu  you see the beverag becom free when you select the buffet  i was close to 9 in befor i ever consid solid food so fine the buffet it is

wait  arent i in vega  shouldnt there be an entir room of food pile high with a verit treasur trove of crab leg or shrimp in some far hidden corner of the place that i onli discov after ive click my heel three time and am too full for the succul crustacean  this buffet is neither grand nor lux  it bare regist a mention on the strip  there is lot of fresh fruit so fine honor mention for import melon and pineappl  otherwis it standard liquid egg fare  go here if your too lazi to leav the venetian but there are better buffet option well anywher els  

the buffet is 2star at best  the friend prompt beverag servic and strong coffe bump it up to 3 starveri averag the onli reason it didnt get 2 star is becaus the price are pretti good for a vega restaur in the venetian

our server was nice but servic was veri slow food came out extrem slow as well i got the steak sandwich and it was probabl half the size of what i expect came with a side of fri food itself tast decent and i was actual full from my small sandwich but noth to rave about 

it a great place to stop by if your on a budget and just need to grab some food but it not by ani mean fanci or nice or good tast for that matterfood review only

i thought this place was just ok we did not eat anyth the whole day so by 5 oclock we just want to eat someth that and 5 happi hour sound good  we share their happi hour appit and i order a pull pork sandwich their appit tast like appit you could find at applebe good but not spectacular their pull pork sandwich was ok the meat tast good but their sauc was too sweet for me i like my sauc spicy

next time i come here i would rather go to a show

zipzap zubidi bopgive golden buddha onli 3 star make me so sad it was onli a year ago that i would have award this restaur the covet 5 star rate but ever sinc howard seftel gave golden buddha such a glow review in the arizona republ this establish has gone downhil drastic 

it almost as if the said screw it we got our good review so now we can put away all the qualiti ingredi ceas polit and speedi servic and basic charg everyth that made this place good 

i love dim sum so despit the deteriort condit i still eat here a lot but i dont have to be happi about it do i

and now it is pretti bad it start at the host stand i hate to call them out but if there is a wait they seat asian peopl befor whitey i actual sat and observ this on more than one occas im all for give a littl preferenti treatment to your friend and famili but there is no way the guy at the front know everi singl asian in town 

i love dim sum so i wait

th dim sum cart rare come around when they do come around they are fill with the same spars select of item  the whole idea behind dim sum is varieti so i wish they would provid a more divers select the stuff they do put out is often cold and limp this is becaus they circul the same stuff round and round again until it gone i understand they dont want to wast food but there come a certain point where it over you just cant serv egg roll that are cold and hard as a rock isnt that a health code violation

i also wish they kept sauc on the tabl like other chines restaur here they onli keep water down chili pasteoil blend worst qualiti avail and realli salti soy sauc most place also make mustard and sweet sauc avail if you ask for said sauc at golden buddha they squeez one dollop into a contain the size of my thumb  for everyon in your entir parti to share parti on one one dollap parti of three one dollap parti of nineteen one dollap

th univers sauc bottl is kept on a podium next to the dirti dish rag incident the togo box are stack here too

i went here for dinner onc i tri to order an appet befor my dinner and the managerwait guy said no you must order everyth at the same time i tri to tell him that i wasnt sure what i want for dinner yet but id like to start with some pot sticker and he repeat no you must order togeth then he mumbl someth about the kitchen be too confus for two separ order from one tabl i was dumb found  

this is the place the arizona republ give top award i think it time for anoth visit howie

i dont know if new manag took over or what but if they keep go down this path of cheap ingredi no select and poor servic they will lose me forev which suck becaus i hate to drive to chandler for dim sum when there should be some great dumpl right in my own backyard i should give it onli 2 star but im a sucker for ani dim sum no matter how crappi salti or cold it is

shap up golden buddha i miss youdo you want to eat chines food in an eleg environ on a friday night in phoenix 

be entertain by classic quiet standard be play live on a piano while you dine

ar you 50 year old and caucasian

then the golden buddha is the place for you 

it in the chines cultur center mall on 44th and a popular weekend spot for dim sum for a dim sum starv valley of the sun golden buddha is decent 

for dinner though it is aw american and not veri authent chines but with a bunch of american custom come for dinner what do you expect they probabl think they are get real chines food by go to the chines mall but then again they are use to pf chang or stix normal in their neighborhood so this is a step up

th best thing about this place is the decor which is clean and nice with a hong kong junk boat design cover the ceil from the bar into the dine room the next best thing is the piano interlud on weekend night the servic is next which is a littl over eager to remov your plate and the last thing is the food 

they do give decent portion i order guo teh potstick and got 6 fat one but they werent serv with the usual soy chili oil and vinegar but a soy and green onion mixtur the mapo tofu was ok as they use a nice silki tofu which was nice but no green onion and slice black mushroom instead which i like but not in this dish

com here for the ambianc and music in the even or on the weekend day for dim sumi realli dont even know where to start for eli  i should have listen when i was walk through the park lot and 2 young men stop me and tri to warn me that it was all old fart in there  but i didnt

i want to vote it a 5 for be a swirl cornucopia of age rich women who wonder whi the age rich men arent hang all over them the age rich men who will liter stop and ask the younger women if theyr look for a sugar daddi the younger women who will answer yes and the younger men who are just sit back wait for the younger women to realiz what theyr doing

i want to vote it a 1 for the same reason

but is the clientel a reason to vote down an establish  the place itself is love  the music was good danc music until the cover band show up and boy were they terribl  so bad that i honest thought it was karaok at first 

all i know is i will never go back it about as far from my kinda scene as you can get  but it nice enough and if your in the area and bore and want some good stori knock yourself outwe hadnt been to eli for quit a while last night the beauti carin and i where in the neighborhood and decid to get some dinner there she love the stir fri dinner and i can alway find someth there
you know we kind of quit go to eli for a whilei just couldnt stand the cigarett smoke even after the cigarett law chang eli smell like smoke for quit a while but the food is pretti good and it a pretti good place for peopl watch it fun to watch the 60 singl minglethey get after it as well as ani 20 someth group of singl i have ever seen as well as have a coupl of pop they pour a pretti decent cocktail it reason quiet so you can have a convers although they have background music that i would call classicsomethingpopbubblegumi dont knowwhen you hear the carpent twice dure your meal it pretti well defin who eli cater to lot of big screen so you can catch the day sport highlights
i had the walley sandwichit was tasti and more than i could eat doe big portion so leftov walley for deede this morn she thought it was heavenly
 isnt the place to see and be seen if you are part of the young or even youngish hip crowd but it doesnt smell like smoke anymor they have pretti good menu that they execut pretti well and you can have nice dinner there at a reason pricefun place to shoot pool drink some beer and peopl watch  we went on a saturday night and this place was pack  kind of difficult to find park nearbi but onc we got in it was a lot of fun

w were lucki enough to find an open pool tabl in the back so we grab it and watch the band and peopl on the danc floor  after shoot a few game of pool we order some nacho and a quesadilla  the food was ok noth great  servic was kind of slowour beer were empti a lot

despit it shortfal it is still a decent place to be entertained

return factor  77what a long strang trip it was to eat at eli we were talk to this guy at the ballpark and he was rave about eli rib so i complet forgot about it until a coupl of week later my wife said there was this great groupon deal for eli fast forward anoth coupl of week and we final made our way over to elis

thi place is your typic bar that serv food it look like the owner is from wisconsin so you badger and packer lover would probabl love this place they do have a lot of menu choic look like they have a lot of happi hour choic as well i had the rib which were definit price lower than a lot of place along with two side i order the sweet potato fri for my wife and i had the garlic mash potato for me both of the side were excel the sweet potato fri were bigger than steak fri the rib were not too tasti im not sure if it was the bbq sauc or what but the rib were veri meati but too pedestrian for my taste

i might stop back and tri some other menu itemcheck this place out with rees and andrea for karaok with a live band on tuesday night  so this review will contain a lot about the karaok experience 
 
th vibe in eli on tuesday was fantastic  the audienc was veri particip with lot of applaus and dancing  what an awesom band and i love the fact that peopl in the audienc got up and danced  even i danc a jig with a gentleman who twirl me around the danc floor  im not the best twirler but i definit did enjoy the offer for the dance  shoutout to rees and andrea for perform love songs  rees sang one of my favorit song summertim porgi and bess gershwin and so appropri for the season  but the hype award has to go to andrea friend rusty  whoot whoot he sang robin thick 2013 summer smash hit blur line and got everyon in the restaur off their feet and dancing  look this is not your amateur karaok night  these peopl sing practice  a lot 
 
i was also hungri when i arrived  i order the cheeseburg slider half order  3 slider becaus everyon say they are the best  i got a few fri and a side salad  the slider were good  noth stellar to write home about  the bread that they use is amaz delicious  the cheeseburg slider come with an au jus and that bread the perfect bread for aus jus  the bread was dens moist and somewhat spongi so it absorb a nice amount of au jus in a doubl dip without the bread becom soggy  i enjoy a coupl of bite and pack the 25 slider for lunch the next day  they have great waffl fri and i enjoy the green hous salad
 
mi return factor is 100 when rees is go to sing  otherwis it is not a place i would go on my ownthe green hous  inspir california cuisine

what in the hell doe that mean  oh wait it must be refer to the fish taco on the menu  but where the sushi  we all know arizona is sever lack in these fine culinari experi  perhap that is whi the good chef at fox restaur have brought us inspir california cuisin sinc us arizonan could use some inspiration

wel hope to be inspir my aunt and i decid a break was in order from the kierland experi and green hous it was  we opt to sit outsid and enjoy the beauti arizona weather  we even got the special treat of enjoy someon cigarett smoke waft toward us while anoth prospect diner contempl go in

green hous can boast quit an eclect menu offer someth for everyon without have to resort to the catalog of a cheesecak factori for exampl  we opt for a roast beef sandwich and grill turkey on flatbread  the roast beef list the raw or undercook disclaim but in fact the beef was well done  i would prefer it not have been chop but with the addit of pickl red onion and fontina chees it was a tasti sandwich  the turkey on flatbread is bill as includ babi swiss avocado butter leaf and hummus spread  the hummus spread was what sold me on the sandwich unfortun i never tast it  not much avocado to speak of either  we also order the fri kick up with parmesan and white truffl oil  certain destin fri if your a fan of truffl oil  perfect cook but serv with ketchup  serious  ketchup and truffl oil  not too inspir on that one

w had pretti good servic overal  but the california lifestyl took hold and our server disappear for quit a while befor bring the check  perhap he ran out to work on his tan

although i probabl wouldnt make the drive just to dine at green hous i wouldnt hesit to stop in for a meal next time im at kierland  some of their entre look pretti appetsweet tomato remind me of a fresh choic and it was my first time at this all you can eat joint 

i came around 430 pm on a saturday and they had a steadi stream of custom  when you walk in the salad bar is alreadi laid out in front of you  they have you get your food and tray way befor you pay  they have a pretti decent select of thing to throw on your salad includ prepar toss salad pasta salad slaw potato salad ton of dress choic and all your typic top  it not hard to fill up your plate with just salad alone

if you ever ventur past the salad bar youll find a few varieti of soup chicken noodl tomato soup french onion etc and chili a make your own bake potato section a few select of focaccia bread cornbread and even the pasta bar  their mac n chees remind me of the kraft in the box varieti which i actual realli like

when your readi to satisfi your sweet tooth they have chocol pud fresh fruit sunda bar and rice pud  i didnt see ani molten lava cake like myke r was talk about though

beverag choic includ your basic soda along with strawberri lemonad and cranberri green tea  you can even make your own coffe with a shot of someth or other and chocol milk with syrup 

they claim that everyth is made from scratch which definit impress me and i wish i could take a look into their kitchen to see if they are realli are brew up chicken stock  they also label what vegetarian and  vegan which is definit a rise trend and help everyon out

servic is surpris good  there someon there to help you find a tabl when your carri your tray and sometim theyll even help you out with your tray too  and there are a lot of busboy and busgirl clear you tabl effici and quick  there were some staff member even ask how thing were

although you may think your eat healthi though you can easili od on the fatti stuff  after all it still a buffet and youll find yourself eat a few too mani bread or potato with real butter and sour cream  

their sunday morn menu offer waffl biscuit and gravi egg and make your own burrito too 

dinner cost about 939pp but you can alway find a coupon in the week ad  it a real deal for children to eat here though  and you can also do take out too 

overal it not a bad choic when your eat like this for under 10pp and with such a varieti everyon will be happiwarn their giant margarita are giant  and it 28 a pop  and no they dont put the price on the menu  so watch out

also we thought there was a typo on the menu when we look at it  a fouritem combo cost more than the five  so obvious we order the fiveitem and paid less  that a nice bonus

th shred beef quesadilla is yummi  and the portion is huge  so go wildfirst thing first  a pizzeria should serv pizza all the time includ lunch not just for dinner  where im from a pizzeria offer you pizza by the slice

that be said i did enjoy some of the aspect of my dinner at cibo  the atmospher and the servic were fantast  the antipasto appet was great and put the antipasto at caff boa to shame  although i did find the mozzarella in the antipasto to be rather flavorless which is bad becaus it my favorit type of chees the nutella crepe with banana was heaven but then again anyth with nutella is

howev there are some pretti major drawback here for me  the wine i had was pretti aw which could have been my own fault  i swear it was franzia or els came out of a box then there is the pizza  we order the vegetarian pizza minus the mushroom and were slight shock to discov when it came out that the top were spread individu on the slice  so you have two slice with a singl slice of roast zucchini two slice with a singl piec of artichok and two slice with a meager portion of red pepper  for 11 for a 12 pizza it should be cover with top i have never in my life seen a pizza construct in such a fashion  i like my top to be mix togeth so you get all the flavor come togeth at onc on everi slice  with the size of the antipasto i was surpris to see that there were so littl top on the pizza itself we also order a calzon which was construct in a similar fashion a lot of meat on one side and chees on the other  and i have to say that there was a lot more dough than i would have like there to be with the calzon  

i would be will to go back to tri some of their lunch sandwich but as far as pizza goe it not go to work out between us

upd  i suggest cibo to a friend over the weekendon to find out they dont serv lunch on saturday  what  if it so urban they should be serv lunch on the weekends

upd  i recent went to cibo for lunch with melissa h  i have to say that i was complet underwhelm by my sandwich  the prosciutto was flavorless  the mozzarella was almost non exist  the tomato slice was huge  i basic had a press tomato sandwich  i didnt think it was possibl for a sandwich to lack flavor that way but appar it is  

peopl need to start eat better sandwich if you think these are great  they are mediocr at best  

meh  im so not impress with this place im sit betwe a 2 and 3 right now but ill give them the 3 sinc the servic is alway friend and they have miss vicki chipman what happened

mi wife and i felt pretti bad after hype cibo up to friend for the past coupl week onli to be treat fair strang and shabbili by our waiter we were the onli two in our group who had been there befor and luckili the onli one embarrass when thing did not go as smooth as we wouldv hoped

our larg parti would agre that the food and the atmospher are still top notch as are the wine and that delici homemad limoncello but the servic just fell off due to one person in particular read nader as review for the full stori but the gist of it is there was a rude miscommun on the waiter part and he was so steadfast attitud about not admit his mistak that it cost him ani addit tip he might have receiv he also chose to do this at peak volum coincid with the entertain break so not onli did everyon at our tabl get an ear but so did the surround patron it was like a scene in a movi when a bunch of peopl who do not belong walk into the wrong bar and the needl scratch right off the record to nader as credit he remain cool but the damag was done later on we found out that our waiter also dissuad other at the tabl from custom their pizza becaus they are perfect the way they are i dont know if he had someth els go on and decid to take it out on us but to snap at us the way he did was truli unacceptable

w were plan on have the tabl sampl some of cibo delici crepe for dessert and im posit we would have certain drank a bit more as well but instead we chose to leav earli and take our busi elsewher will we be back eventu but in all honesti not anytim soon and definit not in that guy section

i in no way would dissuad anyon from tri out cibo they excel at what they do and my experi was most like out of the ordinariafter all the hype i just had to go tri fez out for myself 

on monday i took my mom out to a late lunch around 2 consid the time i wasnt surpris to walk into an empti restaur with onli two other tabl occupi the decor was fun but im definit go to have to check it out at a busier time as im sure the atmospher has got to be better with more peopl around 

i did my homework befor come so i knew they had 2 for 1 margarita on monday the waitress didnt know that haha good thing i was there to remind her although perhap she was just thrown by two women order margarita at 2 on a monday afternoon cest la vie my mom order the apricot margarita and i got the orang margarita both were tasti strong and healthi portion 

have never been i want to tri a few differ thing we end up order the lettuc wrap the rosemari chicken sandwich and a basket of the sweet potato fri to share when everyth arriv i couldnt believ how much food there was it would have been nice if the waitress had advis us on the portion size and told us ahead of time that there was a 1 charg for split a meal i can understand charg that if 2 peopl order just one entre to share but technic we order two and a side if id known i could have just order one thing and she the other and we could have divid them up ourselv it not a big deal but just one of those strang littl avoid surpris at the end of a meal

a for the food the sweet potato fri were amaz ive had them mani place and i have to say these are the best by far that dip sauc is so perfect and the cinnamon sugar on the fri make you feel like your eat dessert in a good way the lettuc wrap were pretti tasti although i didnt expect them to be cold they are serv with romain lettuc rather than iceberg and that was a refresh chang i dont know if ill order them with the fri again becaus there was just too much sweet go on for one meal the rosemari chicken sandwich was realli yummi i couldnt believ how much chicken was on it the best part was the subtl hint of feta im a fan of the chees but onli in small quantiti and they had the perfect proport 

all in all it was a solid experi ill be come back at least two more time  one with some friend dure happi hour and anoth time for brunch as ive just got to tri their egg benedicti am hope to increas the rate next time i go 

build cool and fun
servic on point and friendly
food sound great great menu good sizes

so whi onli 3

the tradit burger was good but not great the price for the burger and salad was a bit high 413

the chibatta bread was realli good the cheddar was realli good the veggi were good 

the dijon was glop in one place not even spread the burger was cook as request  med rare but lack ani real textur it was sort of mushi and not grill much 

the salad was good just not my choic for dress 

i will mention that i love a good 12lb burger medium rare but the burger must be closer to 12 inch thich and have a grill flavor and textur this seem more like a 14 inch and mayb previous frozen patti 

i will go back becaus the rest of the menu look amaz the other luncher seem to enjoy thier foodinterest place

not exclus to fez but like anywher trendi and popular a hip crowd mean pay hip price for drink that are a pain to order whether at the stuf bar or through a server you hope will find you again in a time manner

flirtati staff  some of them mayb too much not in a homophob way but just that if i were a hetero server somewher els and hit on a femal custom this much im sure there would be complaints

th food was realli good and i could see myself enjoy fez more simpli as a regular restaur than an even niteclub type of setgood time w friend leav town   good food balsam blue burger and sampl a few great dessert dulc de lech mouss walnut browni w vanilla ice cream and my tiramisu  oh and the 3 apricosmo tini i had  didnt even finish half of it but i was abl to forget about my shoulderneckhead pain for a coupl of hour

psst  did you get a look at that haboob that whip through the phoenix valley11510
love the lowcarb chees crisp  white chees on a lowcarb wheat crisp superthin and delici  a coupl of firemen came in and one of them immedi spot my chees crisp and remark shes have my favorit the chees crisp

i origin order a white pizza but it had cornmeal in it so sub the chees crisp instead  howev i was told that i could call in a day in advanc and place my order and a pizza could be made free of cornmeal  yay

i also had the stuf shelll san marinara sauc  fill tast great and had creami textur  howev sinc it was bake wo the red sauc part of most of the shell were undercook honest it was ined you can spot the dri uncook area in the photo  wonder if they can prepar it in a way to avoid this in the future

awesom cannoli ricottamascarpon fill made inhous w chocol chip  not too sweet  made me wish i had order more than just one 

realli wish theyd expand and instal a proper dinein area  not realli comfort w the current situat of have to eat w so mani peopl crowd up indoor wait in line  outdoor tabl are alway taken when im there and realli who want to eat outsid while inhal in carbon monoxid traffic fume  not melao laan xang was a bit of a let down mayb i need to stop read review on yelp befor dine at a place it like ruin the surpris of a movi by read it review first and disappoint is alway wors when your expect fall short of the actual experience

mi sister and i had snuck away from a dinner parti with my parent friend to eat out the restaur was moder busi which afford a leisur pace dinner i have memori of this locat when it use to be a decent mexican place call pasqual llx did a good job creat a cozi warm interior work hard to mute out the previous festiv color i just wish they had save a few of the festiv flavor too

w start with the best part of the meal kang gai soup it was savori and rich with a lush coconut flavor and mild spice the tofu in the soup was firm and compliment the soup i kept wolf it down as my sister told me about her recent trip to india 

but the rest of the meal wasnt so tasti the appet combo was a bland combin of fri this and that i could bare tell the tast of the fri shrimp from the spring roll they should throw a chicken skewer or fresh veggi into the mix

for our main we mistaken order the moak pa catfish stuf with dill and steam in banana leav the bland but catfishi flavor was overwhelm and was serv with bland broccoli and steam veggi note to self from now on onli order fri cat fish but wait didnt i alreadi have some as an appetizer

th other dish should have been an easi winner  curri squash again flavor was sore absent and substitut tofu again for chicken didnt help the sauc perhap when we ask for timid spici they took that to mean timid flavor

275  starit amaz what a few block can do in this case not much if your head further east i love me some lao laan never realli had lao prior to move to madison but i just dont get the same attent servic sweet menu recommend and authent experi i so often found on willi what give the menu is more compact but the dine room is bigger so it perfect if you need room to groov but other than the size i think willi is probabl your best bet if your look for curri east of the capitolfriday night dure prime time for snowbird is a tough time to find somewher to eat when you dont want to wait and you dont have a reserv somewhere

w learn this the hard way last week 

mi parent decid that kierland common would be a good place to meet my brother and i for dinner  pf chang is where they told us to meet  i suggest they get there earli as there would be a wait  did they listen nope  so as i am pull into the park lot i get a call on my cell phone from my mom say the wait at pf chang is over an hour and then my brother told me to meet them at bobbi instead

yik  i think i may be under dress for bobbi is what i was think afteral i was in a tshirt and jean and flip flop  oh well  i walk in and upstair where i found my famili seat in the loung area  at least we didnt have to wait

i was underimpress with the servic and food  especi for the price  the music in the loung made it difficult to hear each other and normal i love music but it was just ok  the waitress need to be remind about my drink but she was pleasant 

mi mom enjoy her sear ahi tuna salad my dad and brother both lick their plate clean and comment on the generous serv for the lobster fra diavolo and i had the chilean seabass  go figure

i would not order the sea bass again the mango relish was not so appeal in my opinion but i would return for happi hour or if someon els was foot the bill 

like jane a said in her review this place did not wow me it was just good2 coupl wander around the mgm 
1 coupl get into an argument and leave
1 coupl decid to find a place to eat

seablu was open no reserv necessari 8pm dead

for my entre i had some type of sturgeon fish it was grill no charr burnt overcook i didnt like it i didnt touch it they didnt take it off my bill i wasnt happi about that
th other half had the steak and crab leg he rave and rave about it but this is my review not his someon tell him to  open his own yelp account this review might have gone a bit differently

1 coupl make up and win 10 gs play blackjack
wtf i wish i had gotten in a fightwe had stop by here on christma eve onli to find that the wait for the buffet was 4 hour wtf so we decid to come back on christma day as soon as it open and get in

christma morn we arriv in line for the buffet at 1107am 7 minut after it open and there was a long line alreadi so what do we do we get in line i hate buffet i hate wait in line even more howev it was christma and i did agre to hubbi request of want to eat here hes been want to eat at the wynn buffet the last few time we visit but i said no

so there we were stand in line mind you this isnt even the the line lead into the buffet this was the line against the wall on the opposit side of the buffet this is where you get a full view of all the peopl eat insid in the dine room and all you can do is wait

th line move slowli luckili a friend was with us and so we were chat when the wynn girl walk around pass out complimentari bottl water i was high impress and decid that the hotel was superb in custom servic but still the damn buffet better be mindblow good yeah frank k  his suggest for the wynn buffet to compens for this waiting

believ it or not but exact 2 hour later we were at the front of the line but not befor fork over 50 buck per person lil guy was half price tax includ to go in for the christma feast

aft we were seat we made our way to the buffet i was impress by the lack of push and shove along the buffet line in fact there just seem to be veri few peopl in the dine area it then dawn on me that they make you wait becaus they didnt want their dine area to look and feel like a cafeteria which is essenti what a buffet is all about this way it still feel extrem civil even though your go through the line like you do at a cafeteria and help yourself to food

pro peel and eat shrimp were alreadi peel and were larg instead of the regular miniatur size one you get at other buffet the alaskan king crab leg were fresh and not frozen there was also smoke salmon white anchovi smoke trout and other smoke fish lobstershrimp bisqu was excellent

con although there was an abund of meat such as lamb chop the chop were overcook and realli dri i was so disappoint that they ruin the lamb chop the prime rib was rather good but again i onli like the end piec and it was realli dri like jerki the lamb shank was again over cooked

ther was also chines food includ a few item of dim sum and roast duck italian select which includ thin crust pizza  lacklust a fish station with thing such as halibut wrap in bacon and a soup station like i said the bisqu was fabul but the french onion was way too salti 

i think the wynn use realli great ingredi to put their buffet togeth but the execut of it was poor they ruin great cut of meat by overcook and ruin the cevich by bad marinad for 50 buck i had expect a lot more the varieti was veri minim as well for the 50 dollar price tag i had expect a lot more varieti especi sinc it was call a christma feast  the regular dinner buffet is usual 10 dollar less but even so if this was all they serv i would say at 40 buck a pop it was overpr as well

th dessert were hit and miss the creme brule were torch on site befor place on the shelv but the creme itself was wateri the sorbet and gelato were also hit and miss in flavor depend on which one you got i did enjoy the cheesecak and the sago tapioca pudding

to have wait 2 hour for this meal garner it a mediocr rate at best not worth a 2 hour wait and definit not worth it 50 dollar price tagasychron voic over in a gravelli voice

 ah you ah good  velli good  but berragio buffetfu is bettah  haiyah

placeholdbigger is better  red meat  white picket fenc  valu for the dollar  quantiti over qualiti  underwat automobil compani  wall street tycoon  quantiti  did i say quantiti  quantiti  remind you of anyth  the american dream folk  and what better way to celebr these ideal than to eat at a buffet

im not a big fan of buffet i much prefer qualiti over quantiti  the wynn is howev consid to be one of the best buffet in vega so we figur wed give it a shot

th select is amaz and the dish are pretti creativ for a buffet  the thing that i rememb eating
pizza  thin slice greasi pepperoni was bad  whi wast the space in that belli honestly
v shortrib  fatti but melt in your mouth pretti tasti these were probabl the best thing that i had
lamb oso bucco  tasti and tender but there was a certain artifici flavor to it
lamb chop  i love lamb chop one of my all time fave dish but the meat qualiti was quit mediocre
tandoori bass  im a huge fan of indian food but this was absolut the most disgust tandoori dish i have ever tast in my life bleh barf burp baaaaarf
prim rib  was pretti tasti and proper cook nice and juici but again lack that certain someth in the flavor and tast somewhat artifici of cours come on it vega right  the creami horseradish was unpalat to say the least
smok salmon  along with the veal shortrib this was the highlight of the meal  not the best ive had by ani stretch but it was tasti and well executed
shrimp  well they were shrimp  with cocktail sauc  nuff said
k crab leg  ive never seen so mani crab leg in one place at one time  they brought in barrel liter to stock the buffet  they were good becaus they were crab and i love crab but the leg were incred salti too much so for my tast  but hey dip them in butter and ill keep roll  meh overhyped

then came time for the fame dessert buffet  wow so mani option i dont even know where to start so i grab a littl bit of everyth you know how i roll   noth was veri good though they were okay but i didnt actual finish anyth becaus it wasnt worth the calori  lemon mouss with meringu chocol chip cooki bread pud peach pie all were meh  some chocol thing that my gf grab was pretti decent but im not a big fan of chocol so that didnt sell me  the worst thing was the candi appl  the glaze was so thick that it was like an appl dip in a jolli rancher time to break some teeth  no thanks

if you think that this is a negat review a you should read some of my other review and b it not  it an aok review  my standard were lower becaus it was a buffet and therefor im go 3 star if this was a regular restaur they would have receiv a lower rate  if your go to eat at a buffet this is about as good as it get but if im go to spend 40 per person then i can think of quit a few other option where i would prefer to dine even in vegafour word fluffiest french toast ever

outsid of that id have to question the valu to the 40 a head price tag on the lunch buffet at the wynn  admit the qualiti of the food here far exceed that at the pari buffet but it darn well better be consid the cost is 60 greater  plus no unlimit champagn that an addit charg accord to the server

m be the fat girl that i am i total pig out on the makeyourown caesar salad bar  they have salad that alreadi preconstruct but becaus this is the land of the free and all they also have addit crouton shave parmesan extra lettuc and a vat of caesar dress so you can mix and match to your like  you know in case their prefab caesar isnt perfect enough which i thought it was

immedi next to the salad bar they had a pretti measli select of fruit basic pineappl papaya honeydew and cantaloup  perhap it season  eh  unimpressed

but back to the french toast  sinc this was one of the veri few actual american breakfast food that i actual grew up with it has a special place in my heart  ive never like pancak or waffl and im not ultra fond of french toast of the three major starchi option it the one that i will at least make an attempt at enjoy  i think that some of my retic around commit to love french toast was that ive never had french toast like this befor  light soft and readi to soak up the hot syrup and strawberri compot this stuff absolut melt apart in my mouth  mmm

the bottom line is that id rather just hit a sitdown joint  itd end up cost less and id have fewer opportun to overeat given my dual compuls to 1 maxim the valu of my money and 2 finish everyth on my plate

p  crunchi chocol chip cooki  boo  boo to that  someon need to visit a potbelli for a lesson in how chocol chip cooki should bewait an hour and was pretti disappoint at the varietyselect for weekend brunch

wynn buffet still get a 3 star becaus as far as buffet go it decent but in term of the expect especi sinc your pay around 35 buck it realli doesnt succeed

i think the best thing i ate were probabl the shrimp  leek dumpl from the dim sum section the congeelox  i love smoke salmon shrimp cocktailprim rib fresh fruit and the creme brulee

our waiter was veri unattent  i mean i know it a buffet but it vegas

hint get in for brunch price befor 330pm and you will have more varieti when they switch over to dinner while you are still insid then theyll bring out crab leg  lamb 
i was too full by the time they start switch so i couldnt reap the benefitim a buffet guy i flex my muscl with my fork and knife this is whi i bust my ass off in the gym to lose all this weight just so i can put it back on after eat like a fatti that how i do

 the word allyoucaneat excit me like an ice cream truck excit kid like the comic con excit all the nerd like viagra excit the impot yes ayc get me hard

hard on the wallet this place is about 40 buck for the brunch price dinner price is a littl more they start put dinner item out at 3pm we came in at 230 paid the brunch price and stay for the dinner item this mean i ate bacon omelett sausag more bacon egg benedict and crab leg 

i honest ate more breakfast item than dinner item i love me some breakfast and there is someth about their egg benedict that kept me come for more 

they also have a great select of desserts

thi place won me over the first time i ate here  it was like my first time have sex so mani thing to explor new tast plenti to grab it was amazing

now this place is just ok i wish i pop some viagra befor i ate here just so i can reliv that excitement


th end noth hard about write this reviewi never eat buffet it veri unlik that i wait in line for a meal but the hubbi want to tri it at the wynn he has ask me mani time to give it a tri when there was no line he was lucki that there was no wait at all that day we just walk in paid and got seat within 10 minut otherwis we would go to a regular restaur in stead

i order a sierra nevada and a bloodi mari befor i went to get some food this place is huge i am veri bad at direct i couldnt rememb and find my seat our waiter had to come to get me that anoth reason i dont do buffet in vega i get lost

i like the cold appet lot of varieti lot of vegan dish shellfish was good too seafood dish were delici i tri a few they were all good they had sushi chines stir fri noodl yummi soup bread i realli like the pizza chees and veggi one were so good i couldnt stop eat them 

the food was delici with lot of verieti but i dont think i need all that carv station were the best the thing is i dont eat meat so i miss out the best part hubbi was so happi with prime rib yuk i just kept eat mix oliv and pizza sip on my bloodi mari 

for 35 a person plus beer and bloodi mari our waiter didnt put my bloodi mari in there of cours we had to give him a 20 tip for that so we didnt realli save ani money still around 90 it a casual lunch or brunch valu for us in vega but i dont need to walk so much to get food and get lost at a regular restaurant

pass desert section i didnt even tri to go there to get some desert caus i was realli tire and grumpi from the walk and get food hubbi got me someth chocol mouss chees cake they were yummi 

i told hubbi no more buffet next time you want it you go drive to a lunch buffet by yourself i am just gonna stay in my comfi bed and order room servic 

ps dont get me wrong if you are a buffet lover this is realli a great choic just not my thing to do in vegaspim gonna keep this short

th servic at red 8 is amaz  5 star for all of the friend peopl who work there other than that though red 8 is basic like a fancier pf changswhich in turn is a fancier panda express 
 
this place is worth check out onli if all of the follow apply
1 your stay at the wynn
2 your reeeealli crave asian food like really
3 you dont mind pay well over 10 for noodlto be honest i person might not have made the effort to tri the onestar michelin rate michael mina tuck away in the corner of the bellagio conservatori  botan garden if not for either for sizabl gambl win or las vega restaur week  fortun unfortun it was the latter in my case

for be such a fancyschm dine establish there is quit a bit of nois and hustl and bustl go on here  the kitchen line is most open for diner to view the mad that would usual be go on behind the scene  also server rush around perform task like fold your napkin or give you a new one when you excus yourself from the tabl for a few minut or cut and deconstruct your lobster pot pie for you

asid from the entre i initi found it amus andor iron that the 3 cours prefix dinner option includ such item as a foofoo version of a quarter grill chees sandwich with the soup appet choic 16 and a fanci root beer float 15 for dessert  although quit tasti i realiz that have such item appear on a triplefigur dinner bill might actual have made the joke on me

overal a satisfi meal and experi  the environ is rather hectic but the servic is veri good  the food is except but i would not come back without either a restaur week prefix menu offer or a huge stack of win to splurg withmy bf  i have been on a mission to tri all the michelin star restaur possibl in the usw were about to tri joel robuchon again this trip for our anniversari dinner but decid to tri someth new michael mina restaur is locat in bellagio where the botan garden is next to the cafe

ambi i am not sure what the theme is but i didnt realli like the interioratmospher of the restaur it was so plain and bore need more color or someth i did like our tabl though with a good view of the open kitchen sometim i wonder if the chef think it annoy w me stare in awe at their cook hahah

w got start off w bread and were use to michelin star restaur have multipl select of bread but here at michael minasyou onli get one it was a realli cold dri and plain piec of dinner roll i had to ask our waiter for a new warm one the butter here isnt that great either i was start to get a bad feel of the place alreadi just from this first impression

appetizers
wagyu short rib ravioli  the first time it was undercook but the second time around it was better you couldnt realli tell it was wagyu short rib though

domest caviar parfait  alderwoodsmok salmon crème fraîch shallot potato cake all the ingredi were in symphoni within the first bite the shallot potato cake realli add textur to it the caviar tast wasnt as strong which was good for me

domest caviar  white asparagus  if you love black caviar then get this but i wasnt a fan of this app at all caviar was realli strong and the whole app tast realli fishy

tartar of ahi tuna  it was prepar tabl side as the server mix togeth the tartar i love the fusion of asian pear and toast sesam oil w the tartar the toast was nice and crispi to eat with the tartar 

hamachi sashimi  the best appet we got the yuzu vinaigrett was light and refresh the sashimi was cut beauti and realli fresh present was beauti high recommend this appetizer

seawe  pepper crust ahi tuna  the ahi tuna was sear perfect and the pepper didnt overpow the flavor between this and the hamachi i would say get the hamachi 

entrees
miso glaze chilean sea bass  as alway my bf love his sea bass and got this i expect more from this dishon some part of the sea bass had that butteri rich to it the dashi broth didnt overpow the miso and it wasnt too salty

butt poach main lobster  spinach  ricotta ravioli citrus brown butter yeaaaa buddi i love my lobster and this dish was present flawless the ravioli was cook perfect al dent i like it a lot better than the wagyu ravioli this say a lot come from someon whos basic a carnivor the lobster was cook to perfect as well

lobst pot pie  a lot of peopl were order this so we had to get it the server bring it out to the tabl and cut off the top of the pot pie for you i realli like this dish with the lobster cream wasnt too heavi and there were plenti of lobster piec in the pot pie the pastri was flaki as we expected

american wagyu ribey rossini  hudson valley foie gras pinot noir reduct yumm must order i felt bad for my bf i basic almost ate his entir dish lol the wagyu ribey was cook to a beauti glisten medium rare there was truffl on it and the foie gras ad that kick veri tender ribeye

copp ridg natur veal loin  foie gras farro was delici with the veal the veal was realli tender and not dri at all i did prefer the wayu ribey but the veal loin is a must order as well it was lean  tasty

dessert
michael root beer float  it a root beer float w choc chip  nut cooki the float come w this cute chocol straw that you sip out of then at the end you eat it  it was just regular root beer float to me noth special the cooki howev were warm crispi and not to sweet veri comforting

lincoln candi bar  this was our favorit dessert remind me of a snicker bar but more high end the valrhona chocol went well w the pretzel  peanuts

pass fruit panna cotta  avocado citrus and coconutlim sorbet who knew avocado would be so good w dessert this was a lighter dessert not bad for those who like panna cotta

cheesecak  it was our anniversari and what i like most was that instead of just one anniversari dessert the restaur provid both of us w our own anniversari plate of cheesecak that the first time a restaur has done that i realli like the cheesecak it was light and wasnt as heavi as cheesecak factori the graham cracker crust was crumbl and not too sweet

overal for a 1 star michelin restaur i thought it was just ok compar to the other restaur weve been to michael mina restaur in sf is a lot better for the tast menuexcel food almost pick up my plate to lick it clean

whi then onli 3 stars

1 servic was good but not spectacular  for the price and the bill i expect better  first class price deserv first class servic and this wasnt it  

2 wine sommeli had serious attitud  i ask a coupl of basic question when tri to choos a wine that went with the varieti of dish on the tabl and he actual huf a littl when i didnt get 2 of the 120 bottl he recommend and order the 60 wine instead  piss me off

3 peopl dress like they are in fing disneyland  come on peopl when dine at a 45 a plate restaur run by a world famous chef at least dress for dinner  short and tshirt are so not appropri 

ok the last one realli isnt the restaur fault  it just an issu i have with vega in general  but im not readi to upgrad them to 4 star yet

just my 2 cent worthmy husband and i love steakhous and of cours this was one of the hot spot that we had to tri i had a coupl of peopl recommend this restaur and i was so excit to tri it out when we got to vega the decor is lux and beauti veri eleg but not too much low light creat a great romant atmospher especi the boom of the water fountain at bellagiowhat great entertain 

well with all the ambianc i was drool for what more has to come the servic was great staff was veri nice but it wasnt outstand for an expens restaur especi for vega the bread and butter was noth to rave about so come on steak im a rib eye fan and alway order it so then i can do a fair comparison for the qualiti and tast of the steak when the steak had arriv i dive into it and kept on cut and cut well it wasnt as butteri as i hope the fat on it didnt tast that great and the meat itself was okay dont get me wrong i did eat a major of it with the three accompani side 2 out of 3 were good the mushroom i would not recommend but the potato with the bacon marmalad was veri good my husband didnt think his steak was amaz either but we love see the fountain 

would i recommend this place no not realli there are so mani amaz restaur in vega this one was not one of them it wasnt that it was bad but it was just disappoint the one steakhous that was unforgett is steak from gordan ramsey at the pari that place i give 5 starmaggiano littl itali is on the second floor of the fashion show mall across from the wynn and treasur island on las vega blvd 

maggiano is a chain restaur that can be found in over 20 state i have eaten at the one in minneapoli as well as this one i guess in the hiearchi of italian food chain restaur it goe someth like this

out of the can and not italian chef boyardee
slight better casual not italian oliv garden and macaroni grill
a littl better if you didnt know better pasta pomodoro 
midlevel tri to fool you as highend italian maggiano and buca de beppo
high price and more northern italian il forniao
r great italian dont tend to be chain restaur 

maggiano has nice ambianc expens dark wood decor and is usual veri popular and crowd in vega expect to wait even with a reserv we had a parti of 10 call at 5 and couldnt get reserv until 830 maggiano is perfect for larg parti as they offer huge dish that are meant to be share most have a half size option so take it they offer a famili style approach special menu for larg group where the cost is 2995 per person and includ 2 share appet 2 pasta and 2 main in a bottomless approach they encourag this as they will tell you if you order a la cart it may take 30  45 minut for pasta we went a la cart becaus some didnt want to comprimis into limit select 

the mozzarella buffula appet what they call tomato slice and mozzarella or someth like that is one of my favorit italian appet the special goat mozzarella with a basil leaf over a tomato slice is a nice combin maggiano shred the basil which i prefer the fresh whole leaf you get 3 slice with an order 

the capellini darrabiata which they call by the english name of angel hair come in a huge bowl with about 12 to 1 pound of pasta roma tomato garlic and a littl oil with some basil and a slight spicey arrabiata sauc they have a coupl of lasagna offer either cover in a bolognes ground beef sauc or in a marinara it is huge like everyth is there is a larg menu of good select for most peopl 

they dont offer oliv oil and balsam vinegar with your bread but if you ask for it they will bring it to you 

if you want a lot of food and will to pay over 30 per person for pasta go hereim not the biggest fan of chain place most becaus the food lack love and atmospher seem fake  but if there a chain place that doe it right it would have to be maggiano  the food feel like it been prepar with care and the place is comfort without be too commerci  and their las vega locat is no exception

th maggiano salad and chocol zuccotto cake are a must try

what was particular interest for this visit was the wine i had   i usual find it difficult to smell what im suppos to smell in red wine hint of strawberri cherri oak vanilla leather sunshin earth wind fire etc whatev  not this time i smell the floral bouquet that was suppos to be in my red  i was so shock that i was practic snort instead of drink it
th onli reason i stop was i heard our waiter ask is everyth okay sir  and as i look up from my glass to answer i saw the wife shake her head with the what are you do look and the waiter slight loom behind her with a smirk
i place my glass down and respond were fine  thank you
i shouldv respond with this wine may have gone sour  could you pleas bring me someth els  but then he would have taken the onli wine i could smell properi came here for a compani lunch new year eve despit the incred rude behavior of all the staff  the rio i will stick to review the buffet experience

w were seat in a privat dine area  the buffet and it was pack 100s of peopl our waitress was in a great mood and want to make sure we had a great time

now this is one of the largest buffet in las vega i have ever seen they have so much to choos from a full bar made to order asian soup and more

lik most buffet they have pizzasaladchickenprim ribham and turkey but here they also have a veri larg asian cuisin section with made to order soup teppanyakiwhich had a long line but i have no idea what it isdim sum which i have never seen at ani buffet

plus ton of cold snow crab leg shrimp a full breakfast section mexicanitalian bake chicken duckrib and of cours southern  bbq and alot more i never made it to or cant remember

th gelato was great for dessert but there was realli a disappoint limit dessert select most of the same tire buffet dessert except the banana foster and crepes

th overal select is great the price is fair for a strip buffet 25 per person but the food is just mediocreth same old buffet food as anywher noth realli stood out but noth was bad either

for such a busi day they did an extrem good job of alway have fresh hot food readi to eatcarniv world buffet

it live up to the name there is just about everi categori of food avail at this buffet i cant even name them all 

chines japanes vietnames american mexican italian the list goe on and on and on 

just like your typic buffet prepar to walk through the whole buffet line just to check out what it is they have to offer here this place suit just about everi nation need if you limit yourself to certain food like my dad doe he prefer chines food over all so i would take him here if i was ever with him in vega 

serious if onli my gf can find me the pictur of me along with the 10 plate of food on the tabl that i just finish while hold my belli as if i was pregnant 

i love food and if you want to tri out some ethnic food no better place to check it out then here at carniv world buffetoh chelsea your a tricki littl spot you have tasti tuna taco by far the best fish taco ive had in phoenix but that littl tuna delight cost 18 which is no big thang except that i work within walk distanc of the place and 18 for a lunch taco dish is straight baller status the outsid patio is great and the servic is what it is it a good corpor lunch spot but stay away when it come to dinner it kinda bore oh yeah if you drive by this place they put some crazi tasti smell in the air so be strong and keep drive your wallet will thank youi order the wrong thing i got one of the burger it was smelli kinda dri and burntish on the edg but i order the wrong thing in fact they should remov it from the menu gross


anywho i love this patio and the price was fair the servic was decent and i will definit be back just for the patio it is so calm back there 

perfect ice teai love the cozi home feel i get when i walk in to chelsea so nice and welcom 
howev i am a patio lover so i prefer sit outsid at the cave in by tree and umbrella patio with a mighti fine fireplac 
our food was just okay i had their green chile burger and it was good it could have been better im sure it was just miss a kick mayb complement veggi or sauc im not sure but someth honest i dont realli eat burger all that much but when i crave a fatti burger i expect it to be amaz and noth less come on now  
we also had the cevich as our appet and that was delici super small portion though that is the reason for my 4 star this time such a small portion on one of my favorit dish cevich oh well  other than that we enjoy the bottomless mimosa and a fine pitcher of the oh soo delisiosa sangria yum 
 no dessert or tummi were full of sangria and mimosa  what a heartbreak    

park is imposs dure peak hour so be earli indian food for two  walk upstair at the hawaiian marketplac youll be surpris to see this dim lit restaur and it ampl seat area  they offer a buffet lunch and dinner a la carte

it hard when you want to tri a bunch of differ stuff when it just you and the bf  but tamba offer a coupl of feast to help satisfi that curiosity

for 25 the bf got the ashoka feast which come with

 tandoori chicken spring chicken in a mild spice ginger yogurt sauc  it came with two drumstick and two breast a decent amount to start his meal  there were three dip sauc  the mint one a chutney of some sort and a dark purplish one  im not a particular big fan of tandoori but the bf ate three piec of it

 lamb curri cube of lamb cook with onion tomato garlic red chili and pickl spice  it tast a bit gamey for me but we did enjoy dip our nan bread into the sauce

 chicken tikka masala chunk of boneless chicken roast in the clay oven and then serv in a mild curri sauc  the chicken was white meat and pretti flavorless  but the curri sauc was so good  i wish i had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan bread with  next time ill tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce

 kali dal slow cook black lentil with a medley of spice the bf thought this would tast just fabul in a burrito as in skip the black bean refri bean or pinto and add some black lentil instead  pretti tasti stuff and good with the nan bread too

 rice  a generous scoop coupl with a few green pea for decor  need to enjoy all the love sauc the meal has to offer

 nan white flour tandoori bread  a must when eat indian food  my prefer choic when soak up ani kind of curri especi those that come with tikka masala 

 raita  condiment base on yogurt use as a sauc or dip  serv chill and has a cool effect when eat spici dish  im not a big fan of the raita and was onli dump it on the rice cuz the bf was do it  i can pass on this  

 daili dessert  two small donutlik hole sit in a bath of butter and honey  oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearti indian dinner

i order up the buddha feast for 21 and this is what i got 

 veget samosa crisp golden brown pastri stuf with mild season potato and pea  the order came with two samosa and two dip sauc  the bf was pretti impress by these and im lucki that i had two to share

 malai kofta chunk of chees toss in a mild butteri cream sauc  it came with one chunk of chees onli which i couldnt even tell was chees i thought it was a mixtur of chickpea or someth  the sauc was okay and good for dip 

 saag paneer spinach with our special cottag chees cook in a karahi with hous spice  it came with one piec of cottag chees and i think it lack flavor  the bf said it had been sit out too long and this is one of his favorit indian dishes

 kali dal

 rice

 nan

 raita

 daili dessert

th feast are present quit nice on a larg platter and it a decent amount of food  you definit get the chanc to tast a few differ thing without break the budget or order too much food

th bf also order a mango lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his like  i thought it tast fine but was more wateri than what im use to

servic was good  our water glass were fill without ask  the onli complaint was that our main cours came out too quick after our appet  we had to help the waiter move some dish around while we were still eat and he was juggl the huge platters

ther also a back room avail for privat parti with a more famili style seating

sidenot you can get a 50 off couponentre at the tix4less booth downstair or a 10 coupon from their website

check out the pic of our eat in the busi profili was excit to know about the presenc of an indian restaur right on the strip and we were happi to shell out 40 buck includ tax for a dinner buffet for two of us which is highest that i have paid for an indian buffet the experi turn out to be just okay the qualiti of food was not bad in fact the naan and gulab jamun dessert were excel and  most of the other item except id and sambhar were also okay not great id were certain stale by at least a day 

i have more problem with the varieti aspect of the buffet i have seen more varieti in 10 buffet the number of vegetarian entre especi was limit how can ani indian buffet be complet without a singl paneer entre and realli zucchini as an entre in an indian buffet  o also i would expect more starter than just pakoda and  at least a complimentari chai in a 20 buffet  chai was 2 and wasnt good

next time if you  are on the strip and you crave for indian food take the deuc to indian masala you can thank me by a use vote here later matt big breakfast 

id say the onli thing big about this place is the wait when you walk up to the tini place it look like a miniatur brick block that your not sure is big enough for human you scrawl your name down on a standard piec of notebook paper and then you wait not fifteen minut not twenti more like 60 at least they have free water outsid becaus let face even in octob the phoenix sun can be brutal

peak insid you realiz whi there such a wait about 8 tabl most seat 2 or 4 and about 5 stool at the breakfast bar it no wonder if you do the math the averag person take about 3045 minut to eat breakfast so add the order time the cook time the debit card time and you have about an averag of an hour per meal the odd are against you

but you put your name down so you might as well suck it up it go to be a big wait for matt breakfast so it no wonder the food get such great review your raven by the time your name is call  youd eat the fake flower if you could away with it 

coffe is meh at least they bring ya real cream that awesom 

the decor is minim it said the color orang make one feel hungrier i realli dont think matt need to worri about his patron be hungri by the time they sit down to eat again the wait is big 

but ill stop whine about that move on 

i order the daili special  a scrambl with mushroom and fotini chees it came with home fri and two wedg of cinnamon raisin bread it look veri good when it arriv one bite of the scrambl and i thought i could have made this the home fri were bland noth like kerbi lane in austin texa if youv ever been you know what im talk about pleas somebodi wipe the drool from my face the redeem piec was the bread grant it not the best bread ive had but it was pretti yummi i made sure to finish all that off but i left 12 my scrambl and all but a coupl bite of my home fri behind 

as for the servic is was abov averag not extraordinari like i somehow expect from a place like this that boast the cozi feel of eat among friend the servic was prompt though and the peopl work were friend and seem to be in a chipper mood  that hard to imagin when youv been on your feet sinc befor 6 am with a consist rush one of the cute waitress even made peopl outsid laugh with we accept all kind of payment cash credit check or you can work in the kitchen for a littl bit i thought her happygolucki attitud was a breath of fresh air 

in conclus 

walk away from the tini place i comment im pretti sure i wont be go back there 

from all the great review ive read i had to tri this place im glad i did it was definit an experi especi sinc the polic show up to deal with some next door squabbledrug bustwhoknowswhat at least while i was wait i had free entertain to occupi my timewant a simpl breakfast without doodad and sprinkl hate when peopl come clap by your tabl to sing happi birthday to littl timmi in the booth behind you when all you want is some fing breakfast and coffe matt is the place for you 

i had the pleasur of meet ami d for lunch here a while back i must say i was serious surpris how simpl everyth was i dont know what i was expect but this is a pretti straightforward breakfast joint for my breakfast i had bacon egg hash brown and 1 pancak that was larg enough for two i wash it all down with their honey sweeten lemonad which i thorough enjoy 

so whi three star first of all a three star rate is not a bad rate second it breakfast there realli is no way to mess up a simpl breakfast i definit will go back to tri their burger and mayb ill boost my rate 

matt is aok in my book and i look forward to go backwant to tri either the pork chop or the hog and chick but it was good friday meat abstin so i order the chees omelett with wisconsin cheddar hash brown extra crispi and sourdough toast  omelett made with egg laid by cagefre hen was perfect cook look wonder cheesi and tast divin and while the hash brown tast delici and were amaz crispi they were definit green in color veri butteri  love the sourdough toast especi when slather with seedless blackberri preserves

new health ordin implement just a coupl of week ago doe not allow matt custom to use the restroom behind it kitchen one would have to walk between the work station and the ovengril to use it so if you need to use the lavatori you will to have use the one at the coronado hotel next door917
order the hog and chick httpwwwyelpcombizphotos050dxior1npcuwkbivaqselectshdjvyidwqmo9lphwsrcgshdjvyidwqmo9lphwsrcg two egg and a skilletsear pork chop  all entre come with toast and your choic of hash brown or homefri  i chose whole grain toast and the fantast hash brown  had the egg togo so i concentr on the pork chop hash brown and wholegrain seed toast perfect w honey but i did tri the plum jam they had that day it ok  thank good the butteri hash brown are superb here httpwwwyelpcombizphotos050dxior1npcuwkbivaqselectday5pisteutfbb5a7lyligday5pisteutfbb5a7lylig crispi on the outsid and veri creami on the insid everytim bec the pork chop even w the greenhu marinad still evid on it had almost no flavor  it had the textur of pork chop but other than a veri slight hint of salt the hash brown and toast w honey had more to offer in the tast depart  i may just have to order side of hash brown toast and perhap some bacon nuesk isnt it next time i dine ini use to frequent matt  in fact it was a thing we use to do everi sunday after hike  i love the food and the staff was friend for the most part  but i stop go and until now i never gave it much thought other than i grew tire of wait for 1525 hour  by the time we had finish eat our day was gone  

but i think the thing that made me decid to not come back was the owner tell me that the next time i came there i could not bring in my coffe that i had purchas from anoth establish  i was shock becaus we would go to get coffe becaus a coffe was never an option while wait in line and b we need to do someth while wait the stupid amount of time to be seat  not to mention that the one thing that isnt all that hot at matt is the coffee

so yeah mayb it time to ventur back for their thick cut pepper bacon perhap it will remov the faint bad tast that was left in my mouth from my last visit  but i will not be wait for more than 45 min for a tabl the food just isnt that good and life is too shortlet be posit  matt has the best waffl i have ever had and the pancak are pretti darn amaz 

but matt has too mani rule especi for a dinerstyl restur i feel like everi time i go there i leav be piss off about something

first no substituion  im a vegetarian and most of their dish come with a side a meat  i would rather have a side of potato and that is cheaper for the restur than a side of meat but no substituion i have to order no meat and then pay for a side of potato cmon now
 
also no outsid beverag  matt is locat in an epicent of amaz local coffe shop  i would like to enjoy a handcraft latt from lola instead of matt drip with breakfast  but the waitress will jump on your butt about that coffe cup befor you even sit down
 
loosen up matt it a diner

awesom tip matt doe takeout order if your crave some yummi pancak on a sunday morn and have no desir to stand outsid for 90 minut  call it in it will be readi in 15 minut and you can enjoy a local latt with itthere aint much for vegetarian here fortun i eat fish but if didnt i suppos i could have had what a salad of cours i can get a salad anywher so that aint sayin much the food was pretti good noth mindblow but not bad by ani mean my group snack on a varieti of appet  ahi taco carn taco and quesadilla ahi taco were pretti tasti and contain quit the generous help of ahi about the size of a chicken breast actual quit impress i dont eat meat so i didnt tri the carn taco but my friend said they were pretti good and the quesadilla well they were pretti good too but not enough chees to qualifi as quesadilla in my opinion my biggest problem with this place asid from from the lacklust servic was the lack of veggi option i mean come on peopl almost everi other mexican restaur in the  valley at least has mushroom or spinach enchilada on the menu would it kill you to put someth on a plate you didnt have to kill not judg just sayi was hesit to hit up car for dinner last night becaus of the mix review that were written previous but we were in a time crunch and want to grab a quick bite befor head over to the phoenix neutrino project  i was with my bf we were downtown and it look like it wasnt too crowd so we park and went inside

thi place has charact  it remind us a bit of the origin pita jungl in temp artwork on the wall and a hipster crowd  lot of healthi option on the menu and a nice select of beer as well  we both order the vegetarian wrap sandwich  it come with your choic of orzo or chip  i read terra chip somewher on the menu and sinc i love terra chip i went with the chip  jare went with the orzo salad  our servic was quick and attent and we both enjoy our sandwich not quit as good as pita jungl but pretti good  i was disappoint that the chip my sandwich came with were just plain potato chip not terra chip  jare seem to enjoy his orzo salad

w were in and out in less than an hour and we were satisfi with our light dinner  i would go back to car but id like to explor some of the other downtown local bar and restaur befor i do sothe great 

incred pear prosciutto panini so fn awesom   i wish they would make one as larg as a sleep bag then i would crawl insid and eat my way out

th funni

2 i swear that they slice one pickl into 4050 sliver my pickl was not a spear but more like a the width of two piec of paper

th dumb

th waitress was nice enough but she onli had mayb 1 or 2 tabl at the max and she still forgot about us  i hate flag the staff down to get the checkwent with friend to car sunday even have to say i have walk by car mani of time dure 1st friday but have never stop by and seem like a nice lil local bar noth fanci but not realli a dive either our server was nice and friend 

i order the antipasta plate becaus i want someth to nosh on it was alright it didnt wow me thought i also order the chocol espresso martini and let me tell you  that was a great lil drink love it  my friend order the cuban sandwich and he enjoy it   

glad to have given car a trisinc im a big fan of new american food good drink and stylish atmospher i thought bloom and i would be a match made in heaven unfortun for both of us we turn out to be more like just friend 

i tri bloom for the first time last saturday with a big group of femal relat and famili friend my mom side of the famili is from tuscon and they do a womenon reunion everi so often we sat in the privat room in the back if youv been there you know that this is the atriumlik space with the wallmount aquarium which is actual a flatscreen i did enjoy the privaci of the space and think that it was perfect for convers between guest who have not seen each other in a long time which was the case with our parti the rest of the decor was realli stylish as well  i especi love the wall with the booth which featur funki modern wallpap and giant hang light the atmospher was swanki but romant at the same time 

unfortun the food didnt realli live up to the promis of the decor im big on flavor which sound obvious but a lot of the dish that were suppos to featur flavor influenc from asian and european cuisin were unexpect bland as an exampl my lemongrass scallop with soy butter were veri mild and didnt have much of a detect flavor which is surpris sinc lemongrass has a distinct and bold tast the forbidden rice that came with the dish save the dish for me as it featur the asian flavor that i was expect 

mi appet salad with chill prawn tomato and watermelon was also disappoint there was no real sens that the combin of ingredi was purpos and the shrimp were extrem fishi never a good thing in my humbl opinion especi when the dish is an appet cost 13 similar my mom main dish  florentin ravioli with asian pea cream sauc or someth like that  didnt make that much sens and didnt realli execut terribl well 

there were a few item that i consum that i thought were excel howev the appet of beet blue chees and toast nut was simpl and delici the dessert we tri  the mocha creme brule and the lemon semifreddo were incred and definit the highlight of the meal my dirti martini mix with chopin vodka was also quit good now that i think about it all the dish that i enjoy that night have some thing in common they are simpl and not over fusioni i think i would like bloom a lot better if all of their dish were base on that approach they just dont do the more complex invent dish that well 

im still wait to fall head over heel for a new american restaur that know how to seamless integr various cultur influenc to creat one success dish bloom just wasnt the one1020

had plan on happi hour at crust when i miss my turn so i thought id head back to bloom for more of that asparagus bruschetta 350  i decid id also give the mac n chees 5 a tri so that i may compar it to crust crust mac n chees  the bruschetta was still as scrumptious even though the crostini was bad char  i didnt say anyth until i was almost finish but when i did my serverbartend didnt even offer up an apolog which in most place id get at least that  no biggi bec i took this opportun to splurg on a few heap fork of the mac n chees  while it was delici fontina cheddar and parm i know there were onli three chees use it doe not hold a light to crust crust mac n chees  and forget about take the rest home for leftov bloom mac n chees doe not reheat well unlik crust mac n chees whose crust top still is a contend after day of cold slumber  just pop into the microwav for a few second and your good to go

next time if im abl to say no to the bruschetta i will pass on the mac n chees and probabl tri the smoke salmon galett and artichok heart plate  i onc spi their fish and chip platter 6 dure happi hour and a split serv was still pretti big  i think a uye here is a great idea120809
came in to have more of the asparagus bruschetta dure happi hour cant complain about the 3 price tag but i must say that it seem like everytim i order a plate of this the toast slice get smaller and more burnt  thank good i found a new fave to fall back on but i get ahead of myself
on of the bartend on a previous visit told me that one of his two fave app off of the hh menu the asparagus be one is the raw bigey tuna so i decid to order it  i was vacil between the tuna and the smoke salmon but went ahead w the tuna  the present was veri nice but i could definit detect a strong fishi odor   i flag down the manag and told him my complaint and he repli that the special of the day was a white fish that the kitchen staff was cook up a storm w in the back which may be what i was detect but hed be happi to replac the app with a new one or even w anoth choic  i went w the smoke salmon instead  
thank good for the tuna mishap textur and flavor abound in the smoke salmon app  i absolut love the marriag of smoke salmon supercrisp potato galett and chive creme fraich  im sit at a neighbor grocer the kitchen as we speak and im just hope that the bruschetta plate and side of mac n chees do well to keep me from wish id gone to bloom instead  now did i have room for dessert  but of cours  i had their banana dessert plate which consist of a banana bread muffin ice w banana frost and a slice of banana drizzl w a chocol sauc five frozen vari chocolatecov slice of banana toffe brittl oreo peanut to name a few and a banana milkshak  i would definit order this platter of sweet again d
along w a glass of red i also tri the black and blue mojito a concoct of 10 cane rum muddl mint fresh lime raspberri and blackberri  veri delicias far as buffet in vega go this one was decid middleoftheroad i was think it might be all kind of awesom sauc sinc the line snake out to a solid 20 min wait weird thing is they werent even fill to capac insid im think this may be noth more than a clever ploy to make peopl think there greater demand than in realiti 

of cours i could also just be read into thing way too much 

a dinner for one adult is 25 which is a decent price if your plan to serious gorg yourself until your stomach hate you the theme to this buffet is that all the major cultur are repres so you can dine on mexican chines italian whatev you want 

the hit of the night was the endless crab leg i think they were bill as king crab leg but these must have come from a midget king becaus they were small and tini like t rex arm i still load my plate with enough to feed three peopl 

everyth els was of vari qualiti the italian fare had some passabl sausag  pepper the pasta were ok 

i grab some beef curri from the chines section but the rest of their offer made panda express look high end 

there was a dude cut up prime rib who look like he would rather drown himself in au jus than continu slice meat for one minut longer it alway fun to pick out the employe in vega whose face spell out a lifetim of intern miseri from deal with jackass tourist 

they had banana foster for dessert well actual they have someth like 30 differ dessert but one bite of that and i got instant tunnel vision at least if im go to stuff my remain pocket of space with food it a fruit sort of 

with so mani to choos from i dont see myself come back to this buffet next time im in town i onli ate here becaus i was starv and it was liter the next place i walk intomeh 

i went with high expect sinc virtual everyon that has been to vega had rave about this particular buffet appar buffet are the thing to do in vega and assur me that id have heck of a time indulg in gastronom glee  i had been starv all day and therefor had good prospect of visit it for dinner

wel for 25 for dinner sure  it wasnt a bad deal  but the food varietyqu werent exact up to par  perhap i had too high of expect  but i realli wasnt wowd  perhap im just in a reallli negat mood after have written a onestar review of delta airlin and such negat is spill onto this review  nonetheless i certain wasnt wowd by le villag buffet  in addit to the disappoint food our serv ladi kept forget to get us our beverag and utensil  but she sure did come by enough time to ask you ok  kinda strang  kinda

fresh crepe  sure theyr fresh all right  but sinc when are crepe as thick and puffi as hamburg bun  the textur was off as well  the onli thing i like about their crepe was the unlimit avail of fresh blueberri  oh yeah how could i forget  no chocol ingredi at a creperi  now that outrageous

what i did like was the avail of fresh king crab and mussel  also enjoy was the decor but no music 

mehim just not a buffet kind of girl  i mean all of that food is nice but ill take qualiti over quantiti ani day  the qualiti is good but not great  if you are a volum eater this would be the place to go

i met my uncl here for sunday brunch  i lost count of the number of plate of food that he ate but he definit got his 25 worth  i think that i was abl to make it worth my while in mimosa  

oh and the chocol mouss was delish  but i may have well just rub it on my thigh becaus i know it made a beelin for that areai can see whi le villag buffet was popular sever year back  they receiv mani award for their food howev ive come to the realize that the food is not quit up to par than what it was at their peak 

the food at le villag buffet consist of 5 provinc from franc  each station is theme per provinc  the line was somewhat long for dinner as we arriv around 7pm  we were all starv consid our last real meal was prior to our departur in san jose 

onc we were seat it was no hold bar  we each took off and got our food  i rememb get the prime rib which i like the best  meat was tender and cook perfect  everyth els was just okay for me  i was hungri so it realli didnt matter  the sole was good though  veri fresh and tasti  other notabl note was the chees station and dessert  the creme brule and lemon tart were realli good  i cant eat shellfish but everyon kept get the crab leg and cocktail shrimp

servic was good  the ambianc remind me of an outdoor villagelik set  for dinner we were seat insid an actual cottag of some sort  it felt more quiet and intim wherea for lunch yes we came here again the next day we were seat in the outdoor set which i preferred

honest ive had better buffet experi in vega i dont know if i would come back here again unless they revamp their menuby all right i should be an arachnid crustacean right now  one smother in drawn butter  that if you subscrib to the notion that you are what you eat  fortun im not all spini with eight appendag and an exoskeleton  god  just think about buy a whole new wardrob to fit is make my brain hurt

although i may have come close to eat my own bodi weight in crab leg and shrimp cocktail as well as guzzl near a bottl of champagn all by myself i question whether or not i manag to make up for the 25  15 express pass cost of entri to the buffet  appar this joint compet on the basi of unlimit bubbl not on the qualiti of it food  to be expect for a hasbeen casinohotel like pari i suppose

if one is will to wait through the excess line for regular admitt at the standard 25 price point it probabl a solid valu  my parti was not but hey time is money no  here me not lay claim to my frugal asian roots

recommend for those with superhuman patienc or for alcohol with a wad a cash burn a hole through their pocket  otherwis roll yourself over to the wynn buffet instead

 this is a patent lie
 this may or may not be a patent lieah buffet when your in vega it a stapl that you simpli have to go to a buffet and stuff your face with over load amount of food for a prefix rough 30 plate 

to be honest the price of food in vega is so cheap that it doesnt realli make sens to go to mani buffet your just indulg yourself with more sin and this is come from someon who is an atheist it just not all that healthi and i havent had a postbuffet experi where i said to myself  you know i dont regret eat all that 

no it usual whi the fuck did i eat all that god damn food and follow by me be of no use to anyon for a coupl of hour as i recov from a food coma as well as just not want to do much activ and given that this is vega that a tragic tragic thing 

this buffet has a quaint look and feel to it of cours be in pari it has a certain beauti and the beast feel to it in fact i was wonder when gaston to show up and brag about how much he won in the nickl slot 

the buffet is section off was stuck in some littl fake make shift hous way to kill my line of sight to the fake blue sky paint abov buffet wait staff as for the food select  there was some decent station the carv station seem to be my favorit there someth magic and fresh feel with get meat slice off a whole shank

th fruit select was pretti dismal the dessert select while good i was a littl underwhelm your theme after a french continent locat im sure remi the rat could make better dessert option mayb he was too busi make some of that thrown togeth sushi  

the fish station has shrimp and crab leg some stapl i was proud of over all it a good spot for a meal but my advers feel toward buffet as a whole just doesnt allow me to rank it more than an aokaybuffet are interest  

some time you go and eat a ton ignor the qualiti of the food  other time you go and eat as much as you can know full well that your scarf down some good restaur grade grub  le villag buffet fall kind of in the middl  

the ups
good crepes

th downs
crab leg not alway fresh tast and hard to eat
dessert select is sub par minus the crepes
service

th middl grounds
th prime rib chicken veggi pasta rice etc

so what whi  when you have so mani choic of buffet in a place like vega there no reason you should go somewher you dont love  honest most the food is just okay and one of the biggest appeal thing for me is the snow crabk crab leg  sinc this place werent that good it just okay by my standard  that and the waitress that serv us on multipl occass were not attent  it could be that we had a big group but it could also just be that they forc us to have the 18 tip and they didnt want to earn it  

in the end id go back if other want to but id rather go somewher elsthe varieti here is pretti small youll make your round in less than 5 minut  

their grill has steak chicken and sausag roast pepper and that pretti much it

a lot of sausages

quich lorrain wasnt veri good but their crepe were tasty

oth meat were a bit dri and encrust in salt

just not a veri good variety

soup are general not veri good either i dont like cream of leek 

mash potato with gravi and regular saute veggi are spot on delicious

dessert are good and tasti but i dont like how theyr display out in the open and littl kid touch them and coughsneez on them gross  

it also a bit dark in there has a weird atmospher kind of cold and dim it just weird  someon watch you

heh it an okay buffet that better than the spice market but i prefer rio carniv buffet where most food item are edible

b cautious happi eattri to think of someth new for my lunch date with robert m i rememb they had a 5 burger basket at zuma i hadnt been there for lunch befor i typic stay away from bar when i am work someth about a stale nighttim booz smell is not the best for daytim lunch spot we walk in yes the booz smell was there we were immedi seat and order ice tea  

to my surpris the 5 basket could be a burger or a chicken sandwich with your choic of 3 top and came with fri i opt for the chicken with avocado pepper jack chees and bacon our order came fast and our bill was under 8 bucks

wasnt the best chicken sandwich in the world but it was worth 5 and i would go back again but probabl sit outsid on the patio this time to avoid the smellinvestig review is kroger food 4 less cheaper than kroger smiths

   i shop wherev is conveni usual by a starbuck the green valley parkway food 4 less and smith are two of a few supermarket that i regular do my food shop although they are both own by kroger there is a major differ in the shop environ if you look up no frill in the encyclopedia food 4 less would be the main articl where smith is modern food 4 less is wornout when i visit this food 4 less i feel like i am do a timewarp into the 80s i have been told that this had been a former albertson locat year ago the interior is a dismal paint job that look out of date for the late 80s a few time that i have gone here the shop cart were lock togeth and there have been zero hand basket not veri welcom the select in this 80s store fall short of smith i cannot get my egg plant parmesan at food 4 less where i could get it at smith by the time of checkingout there seem to be a coupl of lane open my last impress of leav the store is bag my own groceri it could be a frustrat experi when there is gridlock caus by custom leisur bag their groceri the truth is that if food 4 less was not in the same shop center as starbuck or practic across the street from my home i would elimin it from my supermarket routine

  kroger manag promot food 4 less as the low cost leader in my opinion they are save money on pass over long overdu remodel shop in both store i realiz there has been veri littl differ in the weight loss of my wallet a light bulb illumin a question in my head is food 4 less realli that much less  than smith i would becom an investig yelper with a pen and pad i went price compar at both store what i found was unexpect below are the item that i compared

         the conclus of my yelp investig is that i save 144 at food 4 less that differ is less than a cup of coffe at starbucks

yelp challeng review 40 of 100befor go downtown to throw some hard 8s  6s at the crap tabl my buddi and i decid to get a quick meal so we didnt have to eat dure our all night of game we found this place and decid to check it out becaus it seem to have asian patron 

we were quick seat and order the chines broccoli in oyster sauc 10 and the spici ying nan rice noodl 14 and the servic was veri quick the portion were decent and it wasnt as greasi compar to the true chines restaur back home the spici on the soup was fair and the chines broccoli was steam just right where it still had a crunch 

expens but what do you expect in the venetian it an altern when you crave decent chines food on the strip late at night without drive to chinatownhalloween vega review  part 7
i love me some noodles

look like ani other fast food noodl joint but with a veri distinct mcdonald layout to it now that i think about it wtf did i eat i know ed went on and on about lo mein that hes been dream of for the longest time but now that i think about it i had pan friend chow mein someth or anoth and perhap  more noodl prepar one way or anoth cant go wrong with noodl i am pretti sure i order lack luster sio mai as well all in all it wasnt bad sinc im sure that it probabl tast 5x as good as it was greasi 

i dont know but i got an extra hour to eat my noodl befor the alcohol swept me up in her sweet morn embrac 
dwhen you eat at noodl asia in the heart of the casino in the venetian hotel and casino you will come here know you will get great tast asian food at veri inflat price

w were a group of four peopl and we were seat right away on a late saturday night

th servic was excel becaus i usual measur it by the fact all of our drink glass were alway full  the attent of staff was 5 yelp star through and through  i guess we got them on a good night after read other yelp review of their service

th food was also excel our group order 3 appet consist of shoi mai pot sticker and wonton yummi sorryi dont rememb the name of the wonton dish i order my favorit dish of minc beef with egg on rice and everyon els order some 3 differ noodl soup which they told me was veri good for their american tastes

th price was omg  high  25 per person not includ tip  when i eat at ani asian food place i am realli driven by price i guess it is becaus i know i can get good asian food without break your wallet  but i knew about the price befor i went into the restaur  it was realli out of sheer conveni of not want to leav the hotel for someth to eat  it realli was the best place for us to eat at the venetian hotel  casino

f yelp star for the food and servic one yelp star for the price  i will give the noodl asia restaur an averag of three yelp star for my visiti have to admiti was fair impress that you could actual find decent asian food at a hotel eateri  i use to think that these joint were onli offer by hotel as a way to satisfi their asian clientel from oversea  i mean all those old asian guy gotta find someth to remind them of home while they take a break from pai gow right

pric are a bit steep relat to normal asian place but obvious there go to be a premium for be where your at  theyr probabl bet that your not go to go out somewher off the strip in search of cheaper chines food in that desert heat  and be a casino theyr take the smart bet  at least they dont cheat you on your order portion are still pretti respectable

for an appet we grab the spici tofu dish off the littl menu card in those plastic holder on the tabl i was expect to get cube but it turn out to be thin slice off a tofu block that had been stir fri and then triangl there were approxim 10 slice or so and the whole thing was spice up wtih chili oil sauc  tast was pretti good and there was certain a bit of kick but there had to be just base on the amount of that oil on the plate  serious i imagin a littl part of health freak would die if they saw this dish i wonder if i should even bother call it a sauc  

the szechwan beef noodl soup niu lo meinnot sure of the spell was tout by one of my friend as possibl the best hes ever had outsid of taiwan and appar one of the the spiciest base on the bead of sweat roll down his head  three of the four of us end up get it base on how much he kept talk about the dish my other friend order the cantones beef stew instead  the broth was flavor and it didnt seem too bad with the sodium level  certain no wors than the averag bowl of pho  there were some good size chunk of meat to go with the noodl so it certain will help get you full

not too bad of a find for a hotel eateri especi if you want to lay off some of that rich food in the buffet  three star if onli becaus i cant afford to give one more after all these inflat price  that said it still probabl one of the more cost effect meal you can find so you could do wors in that regard  and btw that broth realli isnt all that spici so i dont think you have to worri about sweat like my friendsichuan beef noodl soup on the strip quit expens but it pretti delici if your crave warm soup on the strip locat in the venetian 

ye 
 get combo fri rice
 beef noodl soup spici pretti nice and generous chunk of beef and tendon we also appreci that the soup wasnt oili 


no 
 obvious overpr doubl the price of asian food in laoff the strip
 servic was kinda wack they charg an extra curri sauc item on our receipt we complain and then they inform us that they forgot to charg us a dollar for extra chines sausag in our fri rice so we actual owe more blahblahblah typic attitud  

love you vega xodont even bother look at the menu  just order the potato gnocchi with lobster mushroom and black truffl and thank me later  it is sin delici  that dish alon is 5 star worthi 

the servic howev was so disappoint  we had reserv but still wait over 15 minut for our tabl grant we came on a veri busi night right befor the roll stone concert howev our server could have crack a smile or even introduc himself  but noand unfortun that put a damper on the entir meal  also becaus it open into the casinowalkway it  reek of cigarett smoke and everi onc in a while you would hear cheersgruntsyel from drunk passerbi  we ask to be move becaus i am veri sensit to the smoke but it was a full hous and no other tabl were avail  

if i ignor the servic and the tabl locat the meal was actual quit delici  we start with the beef carpaccio appet and it was good although not the best i have ever had  not even close  we also order a dozen oyster on the half shell becaus the seafood platter that they were offer look realli unappet  in fact the tabl next to us were veri upset with their sad look platter it had 2 oyster a few scrawni shrimp cocktail and 2 skinni crab leg they refus to pay for it and ask for the manag  i order the lobster gnocchi and cannot speak high enough about this dish everi bite was burst with flavor  my husband order the risotto and it came with perfect cook scallop and prawn  

bi the time we look at the dessert menu the smell of smoke was realli irrit me and so was our waiter attitud so we ask for the check and bought dessert elsewher  

yelp 100 challeng review 44100there were long wait at other restaur wherea we were seat almost immedi here  the server was realli on top of thing here  

we order the escargot which was good  the fillet of sole was good but lack season  the caesar salad was crisp but had no flavorit 6am you just left the casino on vega and your starv what to do what to do if you have shini red ball syndrom like i do you follow the flash light that say

 5 steak and egg breakfast  24 hours



wa it good no
wa i sober no
wa it edibl yes 

now that i am more compos i can say that the steak wasnt that great it was most fat but for 5 and at 6am what do you expect599 steak and eggs

aft danc the night away at tryst my girl and i decid to hit up barbari coast sinc it has the after parti club drai in there after get drop off by our taxi driver who share some of his not so pleasantexplicit stori of custom we walk by a sign say 599 steak and eggs

hey guy 599 steak and egg now add it up girl at 4am with high heel who danc about how mani hour alreadi in need of hydrat in vega equal what some hungri women we werent go to let that deal getaway from us

so we skip go to drai and decid to eat here the place was pack and wait about 10 minut for our tabl yes tabl is plural becaus they couldnt find us a tabl for 7 but two tabl for 3 and 4 we were hungri women and honest didnt care 

after my tabl got our order a nearbi tabl becam vacant we ask our waiter if it was okay if our friend could move to that tabl he said yes and the ladi move there next thing you know we get the hostess who was this old ladi come over to our tabl and gave us a thing or two about the other group move after we told her the waiter said it would be okay i guess she had a rough night alreadi but serious she didnt have to do that to us 

ani way we didnt want that ladi to spoil our night or appetit and we were so happi when our food arriv short after her tantrum steak and egg hash brown and guess what butter toast the toast is alreadi butter for you and it was mm mmm good with a slab of jelli on that it was delici egg were yum as well as the hash brown and the steak was okay but that what you get i guess when it 599 

over all im sure id find myself here again at 4am in vega but im tell you the servic here is a hit or miss our waiter was cool but that hostess has a mind of her own and is definit will to share itim on this mad hunt to visit everi chines food restaur in all of arizona  without gain 200 pound  so i went to china king the other night  what a strang even  this is a pretti big restaur but it odd becaus it look more like place to have a low budget wed than to go out for dinner  the atmospher doesnt have much person  the bright floresc light should have been in an offic not a restaurant

w were seat by the big tank of live lobster  though i love to eat lobster this disturb me  at one point one of the waitress grab a lobster from the tank and put it in a small white bucket  i watch in amaz as the lobster jump around in the bucket in a mad panic  then i thought i was go to throw up  here is someon order jump around in a bucket

look i know this stuff goe on  anim get kill and serv in restaur everi day  but the part that bother me was i was sit right next the tank of lobster on death row i am awar this may be a person distaste

anyway the servic was not the greatest  the waitress was pleasant just in a hurri and not realli attent  we didnt get ani water until we ask or crunchi noodl with dip sauc  i order the chicken with veget combin dinner which was veri good  my husband order the garlic chicken with veget which he like as well  the portion are pretti big as we had enough for anoth meal for two the next day

so basic the food is good and the servic is soso  if i were to go back i would get my order to go and avoid the live lobster showdim sum is a dish best serv warm  the lack of hot food is what kept this place from get four star from me  china king has some great stuff  i heartili recommend come and get the ta sa bao bbq pork bun and the bo luo bao pineappl bun with delici filling

i have to give a lukewarm review to the similar temperatur food from the hot cart  while a hand were good most were room temperatur  also rather than get new stuff from the kitchen they kept circul it over and over  sigh  i know if it had been warm the food would have been quit good  unfortun it did not make the grade

put the killer bake good and the lukewarm hot food togeth leav me with a confus wishingitwerebett 3 staryelp 365 review challeng 2014  los angel 21  365

after a long 3 12 hour drive from california check into the bellagio and get settl in the room they start crave for asian food the first restaur that come up in noodl becaus it not too big like the other restaur and it tuck away right by the baccarat bar and tabl game 

everi time we wait to be seat it take about 15  20 minut but when chines custom wait they are seat right away like they were vip sound like discrimin to me  the contemporari decor in this restaur was veri relax with various jar of ingredi they use for their overpr food 

our server was friend and person and gave us our drink right away with some time to order 

we order 

hot tea 450  jasmine

chilean sea bass 34 nonya curri sauc bell pepper onion steam homemad garlic ginger sauc broccoli steam or deep fri soy sauc green onion ginger steamed

beef 22 kung pao sauc bell pepper onion peanut broccoli straw mushroom carrot mongolian style bell pepper onion green onions
black pepper sauc asparagus black bean sauc bell pepper onion garlic

chines broccoli 1250 sauté in garlic or steam oyster sauce

cantones roast duck 1850 plum sauce

th food in my honest opinion was delici and i couldnt fault on anyth what bother me and caus the review to go from 5 star to 2 star was the servic it took us a while to get our refil for out water and the food took about 25   35 minut to be serv 

our server kept tell us the food was on it way my dad got tire of wait and went to hit the slot around the restaur i notic a lot of chines custom were get their food much faster than us and that made me irrit i never experienc this level of servic 

nest time ill avoid this over price restaur and go for the bellagio snack bar where i can receiv excel servic and cheaper eati came here for brunch a few day ago and everyth on the menu look so amaz or mayb it was the fact that i was starv lol 

i order the eggington omelett i saw cream chees in it and was like done i have to get it my friend order the crab stuf pastri i enjoy my omelett it was a veri good size and it came with their rich hollandais sauc that was sooooo delici it was veri fill though my friend didnt enjoy her meal much sinc she felt that it was a bit pricey for imit crab 

they have mimosa here for 5 it was ok but probabl wouldv been better with fresh squeez oj instead 

the wait was ok around 20 minut ish on a sunday around noon id come back for brunch if i was in the area came here to watch ufc104

it like a rain forest cafe minus the annoy ss animatron  becaus noth suck more than eat tgif type food with a robot silverback ape goingwellgo apesht

25 minimum purchas per head if you want to stay and watch the fight

no problem  let me get 3 goos and tonic pleas  oh and that gimmicki sampler platter with the dri ice volcano so my boister  buddi can be entertain for a coupl of minutes

w watch the fight shogun rua shouldv gotten the decis  

the douch bag behind was be annoy you know the type  the son of dirti tramp thought he knew it all  tell other peopl that they were wrong  give his two bit when no one gave two shts what he was saying

i had had enough  i channel all my anger and ninja skill into one glorious fist   i was readi throwdown with him  i turn around and see that hes a mean look 65 and 250  then think to myself that hes lucki i had a fresh drink to attend and that realli im too nice of a guy  if not i would have mash out that fool  i go back to my goos and tonic

i wouldnt come back to eat dinner here  cuz realli the food is pretti weak  i would comeback to watch ppv event  and next time im fight that giant douch rag and put on my own ppv and knockin that fool the fck out  hollaatchaboy

smitcha wake up  get your head off the tabl and finish your drinki got a comp for a 5cours dinner experi for two with a person menu at fleur so i was super excit to come here on our most recent vega trip

howev for such an extravag dinner i left with a coupl disappointments

disappoint 1
bi person menu all it realli mean is that the chef come to your tabl befor you order and ask if you have ani food allergi or distast  i said that i didnt like exot meat such as lamb or deer and the chef said it wasnt a problem sinc they dont have those meat in the kitchen anyway  as a fine dine restaur id expect them to have a fancier selection

disappoint 2 
becaus you dont realli get to choos your food i end up get item that i probabl wouldnt have order normallyaka food that didnt tickl my fanci  this includ bland boil kale and veggi in a liquid soup which got soggi after sit a while a huge bowl of weird mushroom that had a funni smell and tast and a salad with an almost poach almost raw egg on it  i probabl onli ate a few piec of each and felt bad wast the rest   also becaus i didnt know what was come out next my stomach wasnt prepar  i was pretti much full after cours 3

mi meal

cours 05 raw oyster in a ponzu sauc under a bed of dri ice
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q
refresh delici and extra present point for keep it on the dri ice

cours 1 potato soup asian slaw crab cake
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2qqccymqr7r2nrb58nfsljeg
prob my favorit cours  the potato soup was so rich and creami and was made with a touch of truffl oil  the slaw wasnt anyth special but a good refresh counter to it adjac rich food  the crab cake was also awesom crispi on the outsid soft and flaki on the insid with ton of real crab meat  i could have had anoth coupl plate of just the soup and crab cake for the meal and would be so happy

cours 2 spinach salad with poach egg
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2q3koo6whvqfsd27bfcsw
th spinach and it dress was actual veri good with a light sweet creami dress that didnt overpow the hearti green  howev i absolut despis runni egg yolk so i had to make sure i didnt pop the egg while eat my green  when i was almost done with the salad it broke on it own and i was done with the dish right then

cours 3 surf and turf salmon and steak
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2qw9bbwd7c8mabiwfkfqe0a
predict flavor but still good  both the salmon and the steak were veri tender and moist  my onli complaint here was there was no starch to pair it with  i end up order a loaf of bread sinc they appar dont sell rice

cours 4 brais beef with espresso foam side mushroom and boil kaleveggies

httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2qonahfbyanlevg5x0anorwa
thi was the weird mushroom and bland boil kaleveggi that i mention abov  i was pretti much full after cours 3 so i couldnt realli enjoy this dish to it fullest but the brais beef was one of my favorit thing of the night  sooo tender flavor and the espresso foam gave it that extra somethin somethin  it sat on a bed of mash potato final starch  even though i was full i ate most of the beef and potatoes

cours 5 chocol cream puff and pineapplecream parfait
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2qwcpwbn9nyecthewb34b9hw
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfleurbyhubertkellerlasvegas2select4hutlyprmjzohtnzoi9m2qzuta5knekhl0lus92euga
so by now i was over and beyond stuf  not realli much of a dessert person i let myself relish one chocol cream puff which was actual pretti good  the chocol was rich and decad pour over the puff dough and between the two puff halv was vanilla bean gelato  yum

i must admit it was a veri tasti meal  some item were not one i would order again but that how it is with a surpris menu i suppos  i think i enjoy the meal a lot more becaus i got it for free but i dont think i would pay the actual valu to eat here againim disappoint to say that this was not a life chang experience

mi wife and i ate at the mansion a few month back and had one of the best dine experi i can rememb latali had all the element to be great but it just fell short

th servic the ambienc and overal atmospher were superb the food wasnt bad but for the price and the expect we had be a joel robuchon restaur it miss the mark in mani ways

w start with the poach kushi oyster and the hamachi ravioli the oyster were decent but onli becaus they were high qualiti oyster there was no pizazz the hamachi crudo was wrap around decad uni roe henc the ravioli and drizzl with a flavor vinaigrett definit the best thing we tri 

the next two dish were quit forgett 

mushroom stuf pasta gratineéd  a dish that not exact sure what it is though the mushroom ragout was season perfectly
langoustin fri in wonton with basil pesto  as i said with the oyster this dish was decent but onli becaus of the langoustin there was no expert techniqu involv just top qualiti product

w next had the famous foie gras stuf quail certain good and fair balanc the sweet soy glaze realli round out the flavors

our sixth offer was the spaghetti with uni butter and leek we ad three gram of shave truffl from alba this was the biggest disappoint of the even there were aspect of this dish that were execut beauti perfect cook pasta and leek but it never realli came togeth flavor wise it was in dire need of salt and there was almost no presenc of uni detect the truffl were bare notic it was veri blah

our server was gracious enough to notic or distast and kind void this dish off of our bill

our final cours was the confit of suckl pig with brais cabbag again impecc execut of most of the compon but the dish was sever unbalanc the cabbag scream for some acid to counteract the beauti fatti and unctuous pork there was a palpabl lack of sear on the pork itself arguabl the best part of a present like this i also wouldv love some kind of jus to bring everyth together

on more note it an open kitchen i saw a lot of cough sneez ear wipe finger tast etc blechhhdure a weekend staycat at palm place hotel  casino we dine at the palm 247 cafe

standard fare noth extra special howev noth realli bad either 

make sure you sign up for a palm player card so that you get the dine discount as list on the menu

him
prim rib dinner 1199 wplayer card 2199 without and come with mash tater and veggi my sweeti thought is was ok noth to brag about realli but then again was not expect it to be fantastic

her
denv omelet wchoic of countri potato or hash brown and toast ad dinner side salad with ranch 

mi pet peev is that i like my omelet made with fresh crack egg not an egg mix i forgot to request fresh crack egg my fault omelet did not have much flavor 

they have late night special from 11pm 6am such as all you can eat pancak 499 16oz bone in ham steak and egg 699 and cheeseburg and fri basket 499

they also have daili special posted

thi cafe was close and conveni while stay on properti is not a place we would make a special trip for

servic was good and refil were plentii visit padr some month ago and was pleasant surpris by my visit i didnt go in with too high of hope becaus i was just go to grab a quick bite it happen to be happi hour at padr which meant reduc price drink and appet i chose to go with the padr margarita on the rock with salt 350 my drink was aok noth amaz about it but it was good i order the mexican street taco and the pork taco again both were aok i prefer the street taco over the pork taco but that just person tast 

i would like to tri padr again for a dinner visit i hear they have a salsa group play on friday night might be fun to tri a new meal and kick up my heelgreat menu with lot of choic and classic rock music that mean the 70s not the 90s littl yelper  i have found the food to alway be good although they sometim run out of thing ahi or crab cake in particular  i do think it a bit expens but i realli have to knock down a star as servic is so erratic

had great servic the other night  but the visit prior we left befor order after a good 10 minut with no one to take a drink order  the best part the hostless who took her time in seat us while she finish her person convers thank us for come in as we walk out  i guess they didnt hire her for her brainmy biggest tip for newbi to ycs look toward the grill and look up  there you will find a nice littl menu of sauc formula  unfortun i never look up  as a result i didnt have enough sauc  in my case that was a good thing becaus the sauc i did have tast like crap so more of the same would have been even crappier

a for the ingredi lot of choic with fresh veggi  i have to say the meat look unappet to me  in fact i had to ask my husband what the hell it was  i guess it a good thing you dont see pile of fresh slice meat els it might not be so fresh after all  but in it frozen to minus 500 degre f state i found i opt for more veggies

two size avail  i went with the larg cram my bowl full until it resembl a small mountain and then wast over half of it  so get the small unless you want leftov or you havent eaten in sever daybreakfast serv 24 hour a day  yes pleas  strong coffe crisp bacon undercook hash brown all in all raffl is a good choic if you need to eat away a hangovraffl is definit not in the supernommyalici categori howev if you are stay at mandalay bay or the hotel it in the superconveni categori the servic is just plain slow get seat is slow get your order taken is slow and get your food is slow depend on when you go you could end up with the nicest server you have ever met or the worst person vega has to offer i have never met an inbetween here 
the seat are comfi though and the food is alright they take part in restaurantcom which i high recommend get if you are stay at mandalay bay becaus chanc are you will be come here for at least one meal i have had the lobster omelet which was sad bland but veri fresh the blt is actual the best thing on the menu as far as im concern my daughter rave about their pancak which were huge two kid could easili share them 
mi biggest complaint about raffl is that you cannot put in a take out order unless you are sat at a tabl so if there is an hour wait you have to wait an hour and sit at a tabl to order milk yesthat happenon the second night of my staycat with my brother and dad who flew in from new york we were up for a new york deli we decid on tri the carnegi deli a restaur i must of pass by a thousand times

  carnegi deli has the distinct of be one of those restaur where a nice overpow deli smell lead guest to the establish as soon as i walk in the mirag i could smell the deli smell beyond blt starbuck  and the sugar factori the issu is that everytim that i look at their menu the price were overpow today wed give it a try

  there are two cue for carnegi deli one is for take out and the other is for dine in

   the dine room is spacious  the restroom are outsid in the casino throughout the restaur are pictur show the histori of carnegi deli

   carnegi deli has a long histori it was establish in 1937 at the intersect of 7th avenu at 55th street in midtown manhattanthroughout the year they have receiv accolad in 1979 ny time critic mimi sheraton name carnegi deli the 1 pastromi in new york citi year later in 2009 dr phil gave a shout out that carnegi deli make the best sandwich later on march 26 2013 i am give a shout out that carnegi deli made the thickest pastrami sandwich that i ever ate

   the carnegi deli websit claim that all of their sandwich are stuf with at least one pound of meat finish the pastrami on rye bread was one of the biggest dine challeng that i face in awhil part of the problem is that i am not crazi over pastrami especi the 17 price carnegi offer other sandwich that includ corn beef 1799 beef or brisket 1799 chop liver 1799 roast beef 1799 turkey 1799 bologn or salami 1499 shrimp salad 1299 and egg salad 1099 if i return i will most like order the shrimp salad sandwich if they are serv me a pound of that stuff i will up my rate to 4 star with the sandwich are pickl all three of us share a bowl of french friesa grand portion inde for a beverag there is fountain coke or bottl of dr brown soda

  carnegi deli motto is that if you can finish your meal weve done someth wrong my motto is that when a sandwich cost 17 i am go to finish my meal unfortun i was so stuf that i pass over tri their renoun cheesecak  that could be for anoth time

th yelp 100 review 49how doe stack stack up  aok to coin a yelpism  we decid to partak in the half price app and well drink between 57pm  we found a nice littl tabl and took a seat  we wait a littl while for someon to take our app order but they were quit busi  

unfortun our first cocktail waitress was not friend at all  she was quit grumpi and didnt smile even onc  we place our order and wait for our cocktail  when my drink was place in front of me i realiz after she left that it was not what i order  tri as we might we could not get the waitress attent  fortun anoth cocktail server came by and quick resolv the mistake

w both order the lobster taco which were realli tini and cute  they tast delici  i wish they would have been bigger   i would have like to have tri anoth app but the lobster taco were the most appet to me  

would i return  perhapon the quest to find decent dim sum in the desert orchid garden was my next tri  they get major point for constant have cart of food roll by  the onli problem was that the select was to the minimum  i would get all excit everi time i see a cart onli to discov each ladi had the same exact thing as the ladi befor her  bummer  

i give them major point for have shanghai dumpl  howev they were horrend  the skin was unusu thick and youll never find me order that here again  they also had the veri special shark fin dumpl soup goon tong gow  to fill with liquid soup dumpl that you have to special order  it come with red vinegar and ginger slice for you to dump into the soup  yes major prop for have it but it didnt tast that great either  and instead of shark fin they had glass noodl instead

their standard shrimp dumpl and pork dumpl were decent  their chicken feet in black bean sauc was flavor  their bean curd wrap seafood thing was okay some of it over steam though  the chines broccoli was slipperi as heck and the shrimp rice noodl was decent too

th tricki thing was that as we hung out after we paid our bill we notic differ stuff come out  i saw the pineappl bun and inquir if there was yellow egg custard in it and the ladi confirm there was  sinc discov this yummi bun onli recent i had to get some  and it was oh so good and pipe hot too  it the marriag of the bolo bao and the nai wong bao  

i onli had the small egg custard tart and this other fruit tart that i wouldnt usual see in a dim sum restaur for dessert  they did have the soft tofu but the ladi scoop it caught too much water in there drown out the syrupi taste

overal orchid garden was a decent place for dim sum on a saturday morn  it a huge place with lot of chines ethnic chines as i could hear cantones be spoken everywher and nonchines custom dine here  i like that you can see nonchines famili dine here as it can often be intimid at these huge dim sum oper  

and the price were pretti decent too with a parti of four it came out to about 65 total and we definit stuf ourselv pretti good too

until i find anoth place better youll find me here again  the wait was minim too and there park in the back as well

upd 010307  ive been back twice alreadi sinc this review  and it not becaus the food is so fabul but i have yet to find a better one  you can easili fit 14 peopl at a tabl with minim wait too  and their pineappl egg custard bun are so worthi wait for  get them while they are hot and take them all if you can  they are that good

upd 110507  went back yesterday for dim sum  their chicken feet was pretti good and the deep fri calamari was a surpris hit too  the bf realli like the roast pork that came with pickl veggi  their chive and shrimp dumpl is good when it hot and thank good the shanghai dumpl never came out sinc i forgot our bad experi with it the first time  the pineappl egg custard bun was present but not quit as good when it not pipe hot  so onli get it when it hot hot hoti must say that dim sum in vega is definit an adventur one has to find a balanc between good qualiti and valu the best authent dim sum place i would definit say chang hong kong cuisin the problem it pricey the worst i would say harbor palac i would not ever go back there again the middl ground orchid garden 

dont get me wrong this place is definit not a five star kinda place but it get the job done if im go i alway and i mean alway go on a saturday morn around 11noon i think the food is the freshest and the wait staff is most toler on sunday i feel the food is recycl from the day befor and the worker tri to rush you in and out like cattle

they have the normal dim sum fare noth too spectacular the food is pretti consist and i know what im in store for the cart push ladi are pretti nice to me now sinc im a familiar face what i mean by that is now they dont tri to forc dish on my tabl or recommend stuff that is cater toward the novice

if i had friend in town i would most like bring them someplac nicer if it just me and my buddi this place is fine whi go to chang and pay up to doubl for a slight higher qualiti when you can go to orchid garden and possibl tast a few extra dish instead

to put it in layman term chang is like a wynnbellagio buffet while orchid garden would be a planet hollywoodmirag buffet easi enoughi dont know whi the hate for this place when it be dead has been just a sad part of the economi and fall through the crack of chang the necropoli is just the shabbi kid on the playground that cant help it and get pick on it grow up now and for this i am hope for a chang as the spot is prime for a success littl build  

there is now 

drink drag
heart attack grill
toy shack 
dennys
luna rossa
fremont mediterranean cafe
2 art galleri one downstair and one upstairs
a few jewelri store 
krave massiv come soon
japanes restaur come soon

 i also saw that banger brew is now in the build but im not sure if they are just brew or open to the public i hope they would do a beer tast room soon as their beer are qualiti and would bring in traffic telemundo and nbc have offic up at top by krave

if your look around downtown for some of the vintag neon light there a lot of them insid here there a lot of empti space on the floor that they serious could do someth with it event wisether is what look to be a stage setup 

the one thing i have alway like though is park it was alway rather cheap and befor often free wo a attend even though it is a rare thing to pay for park in vega it is still the same price or free 3 hour w valid paper from busi in the build cash onli no card on pay your park fare it is just there by fremont east and a easi walk to fremont street experi area a perfect inbetween for where the night take us it never busi so it easi to park by the elev and get inout even when downtown is super pack we dont bother to park at the casino anymor becaus of how conveni it is to park here 

hope one day this place becom someth more again

yelp 100 challeng 31100as far as the old system of dine goe verandah would probabl be consid a 5star restaur fanci set high price impecc servic etc howev in the new food era it not just all about be hoityto to get high star in my book you need to have good food and provid some form of valu proposit base on my breakfast at verandah id have to say that aok is proper 

from entri to exit here the servic is beyond impecc they ask your name at the desk and your subsequ greet by name by everi server that approach you coffe is kept full and it whiteglov the whole way the set is veri pleasant  outdoor next to the mandalay pool system  veri eleg 

the food itself howev leav a bit to be desir it okay but for the price it could be a lot better i sampl a plate of huevo ranchero that cost about as much as a dinner entre would cost at a decent restaur 5 for drip coffe is beyond the pale overal it was up in the mid20 for a simpl entreecoffe breakfast 

i guess im not someon who is will to pay all that extra for exclus come from portland i want the food to be exemplari at that price  especi for breakfast which is notori easi to prepar 

if you want a fourseason experi this is your place if your main goal is good food you may be abl to do betterafter lose all your money at the penni slot black out from drink one too mani appletini there noth more comfort than a sweet smile from an attent waitress hot coffe and cold oj to go along with a nice fill breakfast 

oph serv it all up especi with a line way shorter than the one for the buffet httpwwwyelpcombizphotosp7rwwyp49cdwgvok1um8mgselect3cnddjx72u0dvabeezxkxw

german pancak aka dutch babi signatur dish 10 bake so it look like a deflat popov come sprinkl with powder sugar it was like a thick crepe with subtl sweet the lemon and butter they give you as a top is interest eat this dish is like eat at the buffet so you could probabl order the smaller size httpwwwyelpcombizphotosp7rwwyp49cdwgvok1um8mgselectuysg86682t1alqzrossdfw

mushroom omelet  10 they dont mess around the thing is huge and can easili feed like 10 senior citizen it a littl bit differ from a standard omelet sinc they take the egg cook it in a skillet and then bake it they even give you 3 buttermilk pancak which we couldnt even touch we were so full httpwwwyelpcombizphotosp7rwwyp49cdwgvok1um8mgselectngofblamqh9mxresmpu0q

th food is overflow and hearti 2 peopl can easili share one plate 
your definit go to need energi to get back to the slot this food can put you to sleepwake up earli has never been my sort of thing but late the big f and i have been abl to clamber out of bed just in time to grab brunch at these various restaur blanket this city

omelet hous was on our agenda last weekend and we were worri when we saw a crowd outsid  lucki us no wait though on this sunday afternoon

beyond all the breakfast item they have sandwich homemad soup and chili fri zucchini chicken finger and burgers

although we were tempt by 33 flatland special for 69 the big f couldnt say no to the chicken fri steak  egg with sausag gravi for 839 with his egg over easi  i went for 35 egg white special for 889 an egg white omelet stuf with mushroom spinach zucchini and tomato  for 79 cent off i had the babi omelet make it a smaller dish

oth choic than the toast includ english muffin homemad pumpkin nut bread banana nut bread or tortilla  the most uniqu thing about our meal was the potato  they were almost slice thin enough to be consid homemad potato chip  in a way it was cool but i guess it would have been good to know too

overal it was a satisfactori brunch choic  we didnt think it was extraordinari but it work  youll find a lot of older folk at this place too which to me mean it has some stay power over the years

they are a coupl of kid special too  and on your birthday the meal is on them  just bring at least one pay friend

pic of our brunch are postway overpr for the food they have to offer  anoth fair interest locat brought down by an overpr underwhelm menu  disappointspin and eat are not normal thing i do togeth nor do i ever want to do it again the onli time i spin is after a heavi night of drink  and we all know how fun that is

so the shtick of this place is this it a restaur on a relat tall build in downtown phoenix that spin thus give you a 360 degre view of the area around the hotel 

but it spin just a tad too fast you can hear and feel the gear of the place go oftentim creak in certain area the central wall is paint one bore color of babycrap brown and there noth on it but a hand rail realli that look like a relic from the 70s

and it was freez uncomfort so 

the food was good i had the salmon entre and it was delici wonder cook and a larg portion the appet was a pain in the ass it was a pizza with chees and mushroom and truffl and so tasti but the crust was too flimsi to hold the top but cut it was awkward and the share plate were too small and there aint no way im drop oili mushroom on this dress im wear i gave it up after the first slice 

overal a weird experi the place was practic empti on a friday night and becaus the room is curv you can hear mysteri voic of peopl you cant see can they hear me

even though i like the dinner i wont be back spin around twice was enough for me

fyi one rotat is almost exact an hour long and arizona is damn bore more than onchave not plan on guy savoy be quit as expens for bar bite as we thought we pop in here for dinner instead

thi place is around 1325 for entre and 916 for appetizers

th portion are huge  i mean  epic huge

w order normal appet for the tabl  either two appet or an entre per person for main eat  we could have easili order 23 less food and still had left overs

best free bread bowlpretzel bun cheesi bun zucchini bread  all warm and delici  
whopper milk shaketo die for  balanc candi  milk shake perfect  come in overs glass for maximum calories
onion ringsmountain of beer batter pip hot perfect salt onioni good  came with great dip aolis
french onion soupbig enough to swim in  not over salti good onion flavor high qualiti chees and crouton on top
crab cakeslik the avocado citrus salad with the cake  went togeth great  a bit to dens though  could have done with one not two cakes
clam chowder a littl bit off  definit too sweet
prim rib came with so much fat it need lipo  but other than that this half a cow look fantast 

servic was good though unusu slow  good thing we left earli for dinner sinc we would have been late for our show otherwise

thi is some solid and gigant portion vega eati had a late breakfast here it was decent but pricey for what i got

i had an omelet with mushroom ham and chees potato and toast

th omelet was larg and pretti good the potato were heavi and greasi and the toast wastoast

servic was fair good and the food came reason quickly

i did get a tummi ach probabl becaus i didnt stop eat the potato when i should havesometim i wish i were a coffe drinker  im not  ill have what i call a bitch coffe drink a coupl time a year but that it 
copper star is right across the street from my hous and i just ventur there for the first time with nathan s today
i like the simpl menu for drink  there are a few differ categori and not a million differ variat which i think is cool  if onli other place would kiss
i had the toffe coffe drink and it was pretti good  not great  good  i also had an appl croissant  bare tast the appl  the croissant itself was light butteri and flaki  but where were the apples
i love the atmospher here
i am serious think of becom a coffe drinker  that a key product here and mayb the star would go up if i could tast the qualiti of the coffepop in for some lunch with old friend  after brows the menu i decid to go for the trio of slider which are 3 slider bbq bacon mushroom and regular  it come with a small side order of fri  sinc i wasnt pay for lunch i forgot to get the pricei think it around 9

for 999 you get 4 slidersthat a pretti good deal in an airport restaur  most restaur outsid the airport charg that much for 3 slidersd  the slider were averag had better  of cours the dos xx was tasti and refreshingahhh

thi place can get pretti pack and it difficult to bring larg carri on bag in here so be wary

return factor  80an import part of a las vega trip is eat at a buffet your exhaust from the night befor dehydr from not enough water and too much alcohol and alreadi given into gluttoni so what do you have to lose well your standard and possibl your digniti if you choos the wrong buffet i have had the good and the bad and i would say mgm is neither it just okay 

on a saturday morn just befor noon i was starv so starv that by the time we final sat down to eat i liter grab a plate from the closest food station and fill up a plate with thing i couldnt even pronounc i actual found it quit tasti so i was curious about what other delici thing were out there well that where the okay part of it all come into play everyth els was just okay for 25 though i like a littl better than okay i go to silverton for 17 and it amaz so i wasnt impress by the price

i was howev impress with the pay here kiosk instead of wait in line for etern you just walk up to the kiosk get your receipt and get seat done simpl i appreci that 

i would eat here again if it was veri conveni or i was starv and couldnt wait but i dont think i would realli plan to eat herewell final just over a year ago gabi invit me to lunch at lgo then we switch and went somewher els and that is the last time i have been on the verg of go there not that everyon didnt recommend it when peopl hear where i live they assum im make daili trip to lgo which i now know i should have been 

dottsi and i hit up lgo on wednesday night meet at 730 of cours the place was pack not to mention the absurd park lot thank god i rode my bike but the lgo god smile on me and i found two seat at the chef tabl almost immedi i took in the menu as i wait for dottsi late as alway but i forgiv you though honest there not a lot to take in as the option are few and veri straightforward then i stare at other peopl food and got realli excit so excit that it took me forev to figur out what i want to eat shrimp cevich pizzeria chop salad mushroom parti pizza or vegorama pizza were the final four 

dottsi bought us some time by tell the server he was both gorgeous and had beauti eye way to take one for the team dottsi i went for the pizzeria chop salad and the butternut squash soup to start  my soup was decent but realli i need to stop order thing i make realli well at home becaus im never wow anyway the salad was yummi and id ask for no raisin and our server even came by to make sure it was raisinfre it was and btw he realli was beauti  dottsi pizza look great and i got to sampl a slice and immedi want a whole pie to myself 

i guess it all the more reason to head back to lgo and work through the rest of the menuas far a pizza goe i have to say that lgos pizza is just okay i love love and i mean love pizza i would eat it everi day cold for breakfast even 

but the pie i have had here definit left someth to be desir i love the top and the interest flavour but i am sill wait for that wow factor that make me want to have this pizza again and again  i do love that they will halv the specialti pizza for you with no qualm you can tri two pie in one visit

ther are a few pie on my need to tri that list so i will be back plus i realli want to tri the burger and the wing id say at the least two more trip in the near futur of my own will mayb more if someon els choos to invit 

i love the chandeli in the dine area and the tv over the long bar this place has a nice rustic feel in with the concret bar top and the rich dark wood tabl a few larger tabl for a bigger parti but most of the tabl seat four or two if your by the window 

if you do not like crowd or tight spot this is not the place for you you order your pizza on the groceri side and there are alway a ton of peopl in this itti bitti space the menus are near the regist when they should be near the door but there is usual a kind staff member to ask if you need one 

all in all it is someth i say you should tri onc especi if you love toy new place and love you some pizzadecent for what it is  solid 3 stars

eleph bar is a chain restaur that cater to global cuisin  atmospher seem as if your on a safari dim light and animalesqu motif surround you 

came here for lunch with my grandma fyi  if your a senior you can sign up for their discount program allow you to get 20 off your bill becaus she was crave their lettuc wrap which i must say was decent 

for those of you on a diet or just watch what you eat they offer a lighter side on their menu option i dont understand whi this section of the menu is place toward the back where the dessert and beverag are list oh well i had opt for the quick sear ahi tuna salad in their lighter side menu which was quit fill for a huge plate of salad my ahi tuna was cook just right 

servic here was great i wasnt ignor yet smother 

overal the food is okay noth omg about but decent for the price you pay

nonetheless onli go here if my grandma want to go or if i have friend that feel like go to the barthe eleph bar is a place that i visit when other peopl make the choic to eat here  it in henderson and popular with the work friend becaus we just head over after the work whistl blow  i came here for dinner recent and as is usual for me i search their menu onlin beforehand to see if there was nutrit info avail and there was  i decid that i would either go with their chicken lettuc wrap or the petit sirloin base on calori and protein content  they happen to have a glutenfre menu as well as a lighter menu which i appreci  onc there my friend and i had great servic from our waiter the whole time  i went with the petit sirloin which came with veget and a parmesan bake potato for onli 450 calori and 36 g of proteinright up my alley  it was a tasti meal and i was more than impress with it sinc i didnt know if it was go to be good or not  this is onli the second time ive been here in mayb a year  between them my friend had the mongolian beef and the shrimp and crab louie salad with the mongolian beef look like someth id tri the next time  the pal also had a coupon for free strawberri shortcak with the purchas of two entre and i had a sampl tast of that  delici  the bill came to 43 without the dessert be chargednot bad at all for three peopl  overal this place has a lot of option on it menu enough to satisfi everyon palat and dietari need  i hear the happi hour is great so ill have to return and check that out sometimi cant help but feel the same sentiment as nathan s  i sort of feel bad give this place onli 3 star with all the other rave reviews
 
let me start with the posit  
 
i love love that the place is so small and intim  especi in comparison to most valley restaur that are just cavern  and with the europeanstyl seat you have to get friend with your neighbor  both of these thing make this feel like a good ny restaurant
 
i also love the atmospher and decor in general  veri authent spanish veri laid back not all hip and modern like most restaur tri to be these days
 
the servic was extrem friend from the hostess to all of the waiter and waitress and bus boy that came by
 
mi husband realli like the sangria tinto  he said it wasnt veri strong but tast great
 
inde all of the food tast veri good  our two favorit dish happen to be the daili special  the eggplant barcelona and the turkish custard dessert  but the tortilla patata and the gamba and the spinach with garbanzo were all great as well
 
now to the negat  
 
first select was dread all around  the wine list was veri minim and the veri limit bar didnt help  and there were onli about 8 dish to choos from  when i go for tapa the whole point is have a wide varieti of small plate to choos from
 
everi dish was drown in oil  liter bowl of oil  the food just sat in my stomach afterward and i felt like i need to take a shower to rid myself of all the grease
 
the size of the dish were veri inconsist  i know it tapa and i love me some tapa but general at tapa place i find you could like split each dish three way  the gamba and the spinach were both huge pile that could have been split up to 4 way  but then the tortilla patata was bare larg enough to split two way and then our two favorit dish  the eggplant barcelona and the turkish custard  were both smaller than a deck of card and split them just two way left us each with a singl fork of food  there was a parti of 4 next to us that put in 1 order of the pork tenderloin and the waitress said you should realli get 2 or 3 order of that so everyon can tri some  3 order for 4 peopl to tri it
 
then right along with the food size is the price  90 incl tip for the 4 tapa mention abov plus a glass of sangria 2 glass of wine the dessert and an espresso  2 of the tapa were one bite per person  yikes
 
the food while good was noth outstand  there was no dish that made me stop and say wow now that is well done  they were solid but not amaz  as oppos to the lomo embuchado at cobra y matador in la that i was readi to marri and make babi with

so all in all id say a 35 star experi round down becaus it just wasnt a 4 for me  i cant help but compar this place to my favorit tapa place in the valley sol y sombra in the dc ranch where they have a huge select of fantast wine and a full bar and a huge select of delici and much larger portion tapa for the same pricei was think this review need a titl but i couldnt decid on just one  instead pick your favorit of the follow two

mi even at sensi

     or 

attack of the insan drunk ladies

now that i have that squar away onto the review  

i had reserv for 1 on saturday night at sensi at the bellagio  sinc i was fli solo i decid to sit at the bar which was stylish and contemporari with lot of granit and dark wood and a waterfal  unfortun in contrast to the other highend restaur in the bellagio sensi doesnt have ani wall or door or other barrier separ the interior of the restaur from the foot traffic and general pandemonium happen in the common area  so my hope for a seren dinner were dash befor i even start eating

aft order a sauvignon blanc excel and nosh on the complementari breadbasket of naan and curryflavor chip i decid dinner would be the tast of sensi tast menu  here the rundown

amus bouche
salmon cracker with nori crisp kaffir smoke salmon and wasabi avocado  love present but far too saltybrini for my tast  not enjoyable

cours 1
roast octopus with chorizo fingerl potato arugula salad egg yolk and squid ink aioli  similar to the amus bouch this dish was beauti to look at but all i could tast was salt  i pick it at but didnt finish it

cours 2
alaskan halibut with fennel sweet corn broken rice asparagus and pea  hand down my favorit dish of the night  the halibut was cook to perfect and i love the textur of the intermingl broken rice corn and peas

cours 3
tongu  cheek  brais veal cheek smoke wagyu beef tongu potato pure and red wine reduct  great flavor and beauti cook meat but i was a bit blindsid by the enorm portion of veri rich ingredi which seem out of place in a tast menu sequenc  i guess i cant complain about too much of a good thing right

dessert
greek yogurt panna cotta with honey gele and blackberri couli  silki smooth but overwhelm sweet  a few bite and the sugar rush becam too much to handle

whil the food was a mix bag the real highlight of the even if you can call it that was be accost by a pair of insan drunk ladi idl who stumbl in from the casino sat down next to me grab my utensil out of my hand and help themselv to my food  jeeeeeezus h christ

i beg and plead with the bartend to do someth about the idl but he shrug and did a whole lot of noth  eventu the idl got bore of me and move on to greener pasturesbut my appetit was most ruin at that point  i was hope the bartend could comp at least part of my meal that had been render ined by the idl creepergerm but he refus  instead he pour me a free glass of sauvignon blanc in a togo cup which was a nice gestur but nowher near enough to make up for a spoil dinner  needless to say i quick paid my check and got the hell out of there

and thus end my tale of sensi  possibl the strangest and randomest experi ive ever had as a solo diner in vega or anywher els  



footnot i didnt call them ladi at the time  i use a much less familyfriend term you can probabl guess what it wasi have been want to tri this farmer market out for a long time when i go to the downtown market the veggi are alreadi pick over
anywho  so have the day off i decid to ventur over the sign say open at 10 but when we pull up at 945  all the granola type are alreadi  elbow deep in produc hope i didnt miss anyth 
mcclendon provid the bulk of the produc and it look realli pretti bright purpl red beet deep green leek fingerl potato   shallot  farm fresh broccoli yummi   much of the produc is organ and label to it origin  sever item were from willcox so mucho fresh 

mcclendon has 5 regist open and there still is a line  housew are grab and pick veggi quick  you have to be quick on your toe not to be ran over but it was worth it 

after veggi it most crafti stuff  soap blanket jewelri yarn craft a bread stand   so   not a whole lot

would i go again  if i was in the area i definit would want  to get fresh veggi but i  wouldnt make much effort and i am usual at work  if you live close and are at home wed morn  yeah get over there and grabwell i think the food is just okaypric is slight more expens compar w restaur outsid of bellagio  we did wait for a long time for our food to come that day

i ask for the sauc on the side for the chicken wing but seem like they have hard time do that so i didnt argu and just let them put the sauc on it5 girl were hungri and want a bite befor we start our journey back to the oc so we pull over  the bellagioaft we smell the love flower we saw the line for cafe bellagiolong but it would have to do luckili as we step into line a hostesss came around say 5 5 anybodi have a parti of 5 that when i jump out say 5 here

so we got seat quick our tabl order a pull pork sandwitch french toast  sausag steak  egg caramel grapefruit yogurt parfait and my penn pasta

our server was a realli sweet ladi and she claim my pasta was the best choice

th pasta wasalright the sauc wasnt out of the world plus i have some bad luck with pasta the pasta was a tad overcook as the girl tast it they confirm i wasnt crazi and it was a lil mushyblah but it was edible

th brownsugar coat grapefruit was yum and the parfait had the yummiest fruit  granola

everyon food look alright the ladi substitut my friend toast from steak  egg for a bread basket for the tabl which didnt rock nebodi worldit was meh bread

i expect more from the food but servic was superb
btw iono what goin on but wen i got home i saw i did get charg the 70 on my debit now i check today and that charg is gone and now im charg 12 for cafe bellagiowtheckthis review is base on a singl dinner at cafe bellagio

th first thing i notic was the nice opul decor follow by friend greet by the hostess and our server juli k  the meal then began with a warm tasti roll and butter follow by a good crab dip spread on toast baguett slice  but the dip could have been creamier

a crock of french onion soup with wellmelt gruyer chees was excel and dens meatloaf top by brown gravi and mushroom was veri good with mash potato and green bean  unfortun the chef read the ticket wrong and dian had to send her medium burger back to receiv a medium rare replac  then she pronounc her bacon cheddar cheeseburg with parmesan fri as tast veri good

312 star overal  we will like return for anoth meal when we are in close proxim somewher on the strip as dinner time strike and have no other dine plangreat menu for restaur week last month but honest not the least bit excit in the food depart i had a bore salmon dish my wife had a bore overcook and overseason steak with mash potato  i felt that we got a decent enough valu for our price pay more for the classic tiki ambianc than anyth els but i dont think id return ever again to order off of the regular menu  note on valu awesom halfoff wine list

that said the after dinner coffe cocktail i tri was a solid standout from the bar and this place is primarili known for it bar and the coconut desert thing they serv was pretti tasti as well  note about dessert had it cost anyth extra i wouldnt have order it  i never get dessert when i go out  so at least i got the chanc to tri someth differ and enjoy it i suppose

but the servic  thank our server was total cool  when i first call the restaur with a question prior to arriv the guy who answer was a total jerk and so he got jerki in return  i was in a much better mood upon meet up with my wife and a coupl of good friend when i got there though so i let it go

then throughout our dinner we kept hear the sound of crash plate and glass from the busser pretti sure this was a record for broken dish outsid of a greek celebr or a fight  not too disrupt but also kind of uninspir albeit slight comical

and for the grand final as we were about to leav the chef came out to meek say hello to his tabl  this did not seem like the kind of chef who like to be out in front of the public which is fine by me but it probabl requir by corpor  so it seem awkward  i felt bad for the guy

al in all it was a pretti good night but i wouldnt particular blame trader vic for it  they were just good enoughlook into restaur and see a butt load of chines peopl aw hell yeah this place cant be bad

a butt load of chines peopl in an asian restaur  a wait line  this cant be too bad

okay so this place wasnt bad at all even with the ridicul name but it just doesnt compar to what i get in sf x but the food here was still fair decent for a dim sum place in a funni smell casino 

dim sum is what for lunch
lik most dim sum place you have women push around cart full of food ask if you want ani of this or ani of that what they serv here is exact what ani other dim sum restaur in sf would have the food was okay and for sure did not and could not compar to the dim sum i get in sf but the bbq pork fri rice was the best thing we had that afternoon im go to go out on a limb here and say it was better than most bbq pork fri rice dish ive tri in sf x

service
our waiter was quick he took drink order down he memor the drink order and a coupl minut later he was back with all the drink damn then we ask for bbq pork fri rice a coupl minut if not a minut later he come back with it 

conclusion
i definit wouldnt mind come back here and who know mayb dure my next vega trip ill make a return in the spirit of josh ds post i will argu that sassi doe not have the best gourmet italian food west of the atlant  in fact i wasnt impress with the food here at all  we had the chef tast menu for 59 per person and the wine pair for 39

cocktail  i had the appleging fizz which was not at all fizzi too sweet and had mint leav that had brown in it  

the bar snack cours was decent  a select of bruschetta and some oliv  not bad but not stellar

appet  we were brought a larg plate of assort appet  grill beet caramel fennel spici calamari broccoli rabe and some other thing that were quit forgett appar  this plate though impress in appear was an all around failur  my group consist of some veri adventur eater and this didnt cut it even for them  the tast just didnt meld and it just felt off

salad  the salad seem like it was noth more than bag lettuc with some slice carrot and radish in dress  veri disappointing

pasta  probabl the highlight of the night  the pasta was so perfect cook it was heaven  it was serv with lima bean green bread crumb  parmesan in some light oliv oil  i have to mention howev that my plate had a million lima bean and no green  my mom plate howev had all green bare ani lima bean  what up with that

main cours  i was given the sear ahi my husband the lamb sausag and my mom the halibut in bag  the ahi was bare sear and cold the lamb sausag was complet dri and over cook and when my mom open her bag it stunk up the entir albeit beauti dine room with fish smell  im sorri that just not acceptable

w got a special assort of desert which was nice and they were probabl our favorit part of the night

oh and from the room we were seat in you could hear the chef scream bloodi murder at his staff now and again  that all well and fine if your gordon ramsay and your patron know what theyr in for but we came for an intim eleg dinner pleas shut up

anyway i onli give this restaur 3 star becaus of how amaz beauti it is  so while i wont say to never come here in my opinion youd be much better serv to stop in for some bar snack and wine than have a full meal070713

the food and cocktail flyer my sister found or was hand im not sure which for i wasnt there when she acquir it mention special from all the restaur and bar there and on friday through sunday hole in the river and rico american grill offer 20 militari discount on both food and cocktail purchas there  yes even spous of militari personnel  i wish all restaur deliv food to the pool area but i suppos that could be tax when it too hot and a madhous of peopl move from one pool to the next outdoor  we purchas a coupl of cocktail from slim picken the grill and bar situat at the pool area and i realli enjoy my black  ginger which was made with capt morgan spice rum cock n bull ginger beer and fresh lime 8  i want to order second  we order food from hole in the wall look for my review there soon but order a pound o fri 6 a coupl hour later swim burn around 11 calori a minut and it was delici  i enjoy the fri plain which were simpli season with salt and pepper but also came with ketchup and ranch dress  the pound o fri app was a big hit with everyone

whil i saw mani server dress in turquois shirt dart in and out of the crowd i never saw ani nearbi when we need a drink or want to order food  there were water dispens with small plastic cup all around but if you want icecold water you can get some from the barsauc has grown on me particular this locat sinc this is the one i frequent end up at for a quick lunch or casual dinner spot near home

i typic order chop salad at lunch  the chop turkey  feta salad is what i had today  i had them add asparagus which was a great call if i may say so myself  the larg salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch fresh fill healthi enough and pretti inexpens when it come to design salad around town  i also like the spinach pancetta  goat chees and the veggi  age parmesan salad  

mi husband eat at sauc often as well he goe for a salad or sandwich  last time we were there togeth he had the salami turkey prosciutto  mozzarella panini  i had a bite and was pleasant surpris it had a nice balanc of thin slice meat chees lettuc tomato and tangi red wine vinegar in between two perfect grill piec of bread  the thin crust pizza are pretti decent also  depend on your appetit share a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactori meal 

what i like about sauc the most fast friend and effici servic in a clean and casual environ  the moder price is also a big plus in my book especi in this economiafter my recent dine experi with phil bbq in san diego i just figur not mani bbq place cant be beaten unless im in kansa citi or st loui dont plan ani idea with me please

i ran into this place on the northwest part of las vega on rainbow blvd as i park my hoopti i saw a pig pictur on the restaur logo see the pig is exact like look myself in the mirror except the mirror didnt crack

th pig on the logo and look at the menu mean the restaur serv onli pork rib 

i was disappoint to read that so i order the st loui ribnmeat combo anyway for 1699 i get 4 slab of slowcook pork rib with anoth meat choic in which i took the chicken tender i also get two side and i took the red skin mash potato and the firecrack green bean the pork rib tast spici lean and tender the chicken tender was noth to brag about but the tangi and spici chipotl dip sauc add a nice touch the mash potato were lumpi and add a mellow garlic tast  the bean had bacon bit and add a nice crunch httpwwwyelpcombizphotosn4bbeibqngtueemutu9u3wselectzobq6ibgmmxinrwbwakfzq

i also ad a tall 23oz glass of blue moon beer for 600 i love the nutti tast of the cold beer and goe well with my meal httpwwwyelpcombizphotosn4bbeibqngtueemutu9u3wselectc5pnlwmvvoimdijuke8pjq

mik was my waiter and he treat me realli well on my need need 

pork rib or beef rib ill stick with beef but this place is not bad thoughwe stop here on a whim for dinner not even look at the yelp review in advanc i would definit have been scare off if i had look so that probabl a good thing my fella is a sucker for buffet so i decid to be a good girlfriend 

there was no line and we notic that they offer a discount with a reward club so we made sure to get one befor we went the price werent great but we decid to still give it a shot we were seat quick and the server was veri friend and brought our drink 

the line was pretti well stock they had a lot of varieti which i was littl surpris by it was a basic buffet but unlik some of the more expens buffet in town they had a lot of thing to choos from and it was better than expect they have theme night so that fun definit a better experi than expect not the best food or buffet in town but a solid choic if your at south pointas far as buffet goe it okay 
price was so so you get a discount if you have a player club card onli the card member not your whole parti get the discount which suck when your with a bunch of kids

they had a varieti of cuisin seafood bbq chines mexican but noth stood out 

servic was veri effici and friend 

i cant say i would recommend this place there are other option you might want to explor befor come hereit was an underwhelm experi the food was decent all around but not mindblow the bake goat chees marinara 1095 was heavi on the chees light on the marinara and came with more than enough toast the chicken parmesan 1495 was pretti good but similar to a million other version of the dish it was someth that we could have gotten anywher els last up was the filet mignon 3095 it was a nice char tender cut that was cook medium rare as order with some butteri and garlici mash potato along with green bean and carrot 

the atmospher make for a nice chill place for local to hang out and the isol booth that run along the bar make for an ideal place to have an intim dinner where you can actual sustain a convers despit the loud crowd nois from the barthis is my second favorit buffet at the rio  in fact if it wasnt for the varieti of seafood option that are not avail at most buffet includ lobster i would not eat here at all  reason  1 it is veri expens and there is alway a realli long wait  2 you dont receiv a local 12 price like you do at carniv world  3 the food is often just mediocr  i love lobster but the last time i ate here it was overcook  the time befor that it was cold  the vultur eat there are pig and often spill the drawn butter or make a mess of the lobster area  also often time you have to wait for more to come out

i will say that other than the lobster the rest of the seafood usual tast great but the bottom line is if i am go to pay that much for buffet food it better be darn good otherwis i could just go to joe seafood or someth similar and get my lobster prepar much betteri ventur again to the the downtown side of i17  i have been interest in tri a pei wei for quit some time but i thought it would be the one at 67th and 101 for dinner rather than this one for lunch  miser traffic cramp park i drove right by the place  but none of that is the restaur fault

i got there at 1pm on a friday figur the lunch rush would be clear  as i walk up to the order desk i spot 3 differ 2 person tabl to choos from  by the time i got my order place no one in front of me all three were be use and the onli one open was next to one occupi by a one pretti woman just over 12 my age  i left my number and went off to fill my ice tea glass and in that 2 minut she was gone and the tabl was alreadi clear for the next guest  drat scare off anoth one  over the next 25 minut that i was there the dine area did inde clear out some but not as much as i expect  between the open kitchen the music and all the talk i thought the nois level was pretti high

mi meal took about 10 minut to arriv which i think is about right  i order the limit time offer of thai mango chicken with white rice 775 and an ice tea soft drink 175  it actual look like the pictur on the web site  slight spici on the hot side about what i expect but more syrupi on the sweet side than i would like  chain seem to like syrupi  the server were quick to bring dish out without let them sit and were keep the tabl clean off

overal i think it is slight nicer and slight more expens than panda express  i wouldnt balk at go there again if that is what was suggest  if in the right part of town i would prefer to go to wok n stix for about the same overal qualiti and price and it is local ownyou like steak  you like titti  come to treasur for both

food  fantast  treasur was classi and their steak were on par with some of the high end steakhous that i had in the past  steak price rang between 4070 dollar and side are separ  they also had a huge lobster tail and filet mignon special for 65  even if your not down for titti i would recommend come here for dinner

girl  better than averag  my friend argu that spearmint has the best girl but i say that onli becaus they have more to pick from  on an averag basi i think treasur win  the venu is much more luxuri compar to spearmint and it less crowd  if you want to get titti slap with class treasur is the way to go

anoth word of advic call their limo servic to save on cover charg  702259girl  we didnt know about the free cover if they pick you up so my friend and i end up pay 30 eachwhich could have gone to anoth 10 lap dancthis probabl should be a onestar review
th extra star are onli becaus someon in managementownership understood im not a dumb drunk bitch and have a brain 

went on saturday night with thank to a promot who was hope to show 3 girl a good time two of which were celebr their 30th birthday one of which was me 

promot told me in advanc there would be no cover but a 27 two welldrink minimum which is paid prior to enter the club 
okay fine 

were given receipt which are also drink ticket 

after sit down and get a feel for the vibe a server come over to take our drink order 
at the same time anoth server swoop behind my girlfriend and took her drink ticket 
origin server said she could onli serv us 2 drink for the 3 of us after we had explain anoth server just grab the ticket without take an order 
and wait a minut we had 4 addit ticket between 2 of us
what just happen here
pretti sure 3 chick x 2 drink ticket  6 drink 

this is where manag came in ask who took the drink ticket and theyd be happi to compens the next round of drink 
that nice and all but i alreadi paid for the second round of drink 

me and my girlfriend decid it wasnt worth stay and ask the front if we could at least receiv half of our money back 
we didnt even take but one sip of our drink befor attempt to walk out and the entir shadi debacl had me complet on edg 

anoth manag may have been an owner came out to explain there would not be an opportun for refund but he want to tri to make it up to us 
be a busi owner myself i would want the same opportun befor someon complet gave up on me 
so we follow him back in and were accompani by a privat tabl server and bottl servic  all which were excel unexpect and much appreci 

long stori short

th men who work there were respect and help 
the femal server tri to pull wretch shit over other femal 
the entertain is soso some entertain were realli into it and other were not 

to ani femal parti interest in check it out
id most definit proceed with caution add dude to your group or just pay for a reserv tabli know it a chain but i had a coupon for a free appet and a 25 gift card to use lunch came out to 4 and chang hard to beat our server regina was fantast patient person and professional

newli quasivegetarian hubbi had the coconut curri veget dish and realli like it except for the bizarr textur of the silki tofu it was like warm custard in a chewi rectangl were just learn about  this tofu thing i had the cantones scallop which were cook well but should have been clean better most had some grit the dish was a littl mild even for this midwestern girl the crispi green bean app was realli good green bean flash fri in a salti tempura so the bean also stay crisp

look peopl cheat on big wong and gourmet hous with pf chang is like hubbi cheat on me with a blowup doll it doesnt exact count it was just a cheap thrill when we found ourselv on the wrong side of towndoe the new time have a better opinion than me  that was the question i tri to answer when i went here to tri out the wing  the new time best of phoenix declar this restaur as have the best wing so i had to check it out

sid note i use to regular hang out at the half moon on bell when i live up in that big boxcorpor chain infus section of town  we went almost everi weekend to partak in their real long island ice tea for 250 and enjoy it despit it be a sport bar we are not sport fan  the food was pretti good and the booz even better

back to the review  it a nice sport bar that manag to accomod a plethora of sport fan with an insan number of tvs  the hostess even ask which team you are tri to watch so that she can seat you accord  becaus we were there for the food and not the sport we were seat immedi and without hassl  luckili we happen to sit near the tvs play the bill so we pay a littl bit of attention

you can order the wing by poundag  12 1 or 2  not by number of wing which was a littl confus for us  were use to order a dozen per person if it the meal half for an appet  becaus neither of us were over hungri we order 1 pound medium with a side of hot  what we got was 9 wing without sauc and a side of hot sauc for 9 that right 1 per wing  i alreadi felt hose but i was will to forgiv the price for the alleg best wing in phoenix

no sauc on the wing  they were cook crispi as we ask them to be and they were somewhat meati  the side of hot sauc was a small contain of gelatin chili sauc like the stuff they give to you at asian restaur no flavor just hot

luckili the long island ice tea was just as tasti as i rememb otherwis i would have left veri unhappi  i wouldnt make a point of go here for wing  they arent even as adequ as the good wing ive found in phoenix  but for all of you nonpurist they do have bbq thai peanut and other flavors

oh yeah i forgot about the statement on the menu that claim that separ check massiv slow down the servic realli serious  this isnt a problem at mani restaur at which i have attend with a larg group  this isnt realli conduc to a sport bar as far as im concern  wouldnt it be wonder to meet a bunch of friend to watch your favorit team and not have to worri about separ check massiv slow down your servic  dont tri it here they warn you against it befor you even order foodthis place confus me  you walk in and think that this is a pretti decent sport bar  then you get up to go the bathroom and see all the hidden room and loung area  i dont understand it is it for the peopl who get bucket of beer servic  whi do you need to section it off  is it a club later at night

food was pricier than it should have been for a halfass sport bar  and there was no creativ in the menu which there should be for the price  this place get a passthis cheesecak factori is like all of the other consist  that is actual what made mcdonald famous consist  it veri crowd quit loud and if you are lucki enough to get a patio seat you will be treat to the poseidon show complet with smoke water and flame 

mi husband went with a chicken pasta dish and i opt for the chicken tostada salad  both were good as usual  the servic was excel as it should be in a big hospit base town   

is it flash fanci or differentno but if you are look for a quick meal without break the bank then here your placei dont like american comfort food or huge portion  here i got both howev the qualiti of the food is good nevertheless if you like american comfort food you will absolut ador this place the decor ambienc and servic are great i had a great time meet a buddi of my bf here and tri some of his pasta dish the pasta was veri veri good the fri chicken on top of it i avoid they like to put branch of rosemari on top of their dish here we joke refer to them as tree my bf and i share some bbq rib which had a bbq sauc that tast more like teriyaki than anyth it would have been good if the meat was not so fall off the bone tender plus the meat didnt have a smoki flavor they call their food twist farm food and inde it is there are mani thing you will notic about your plate that will give you that idea their biscuit are not bad they have a sweet sauc drizzl on them but they are a bit too big for your mouth and a littl too hard i had a mango tea be warn  refil are 1 price are not bad consid they do give you huge portionsw got seat real quick park is not an issuim just not a fan i dont care how big the portion are 

each time ive been to this locat it a horribl long wait and the servic is veri uncar and slow 
the food is good but it not amaz not worth wait over an hour for in ani case or pay the higher price im not sure whi peopl are obsess with larg portion of foodespeci for breakfast hard anyon ever finish it and breakfast food is typic not what you want for leftovers

thi place is ehi have been to hash hous sever time over the year usual when friend are in town  i onli go when my group of friend want to go  it realli isnt one of my go to place  i like the food but i dont think it is super special  

ye you get huge serv and will almost alway have leftov to bring home which is a plus but not enough to make me a diehard hh fan  my complaint would be that the food doesnt have a ton of flavor  i have had a lot of differ item that alway sound good look beauti and have great present but almost alway the food is lack flavor  everyth is bland to me  i alway have to add a ton of salt pepper hot sauc syrup or someth to add some flavor  i love chicken and waffl in general but the chicken here is alway lack season i do think the kokomo sandwich is quit tasti though

i will probabl keep end up at hh occasion becaus so mani friend are in love with this place  i will keep give it a chanc when i am there becaus i like the concept and the idea of the place  and like i said i think it is ok just noth amaz312 stars

in this episod of me vs food food has triumph i got my ass kick by a chocol chip pancak the pancak sit on the plate look deceiv flat it was at least a half an inch thick by 12 inch i thought it would be no problem for me to kill this thing sinc the last time i was here i complet finish an origin farm benedict and still had room for dessert must be get old  i took half of it home and had it for breakfast the next morn spike watermelon kiwi juic was refresh  order it with an extra shot of vodka this meal was definit carb overload my desir for pancak has been satiat for the year  hopei think almost all of my friend have post photo from hash hous a go go through the year sinc i like to take the red eye from honolulu i am often on the hunt for a nice breakfast when i land in vega my usual stop is bouchon but i thought i would tri someth differ on my most recent trip

im an egg benedict kind of gal but when i go to a restaur i like to tri what theyr known for so i opt for the sage fri chicken on the bacon waffl my mom order a crab cake benedict which was a special so i figur i could steal some bite from her plate

th present of the chicken and waffl is impress howev it look a lot better than it tast the chicken was quit bland and although i tend to like my pancak and waffl on the dri side  the syrup contain seem realli tini to me i consid ask for more but i felt a littl asham p the idea of bacon in waffl is a good one but the execut was lack i think mayb the waffl were not crispi enough

mi mom dish was a lot better and i sort of kick myself for stray from my usual the portion size for both dish were gigant so if you have a big appetit this is a great place for you servic was friend and effici overal im glad i went onc to cross it off my list but i am not eager to go againmesa grill was close so we had lunch at hyakumi instead the menu was scari scari overpr what restaur owner can sleep at night when he charg 20 for a sushi roll im not refer to specialti rollslay with sashimi and and smother with caviar and gold flakesim speak of your basic spider and rainbow rolls

th roll were admit overs and tasti but they hurt especi when i can get each roll for less than half the price at ani neighborhood sushi bar in sf shame on hyakumiokay i was in vega a coupl of week ago for the biggest gather of nerd techi rocket scientist and geek on the planet  and yes i admit im one of them and yes we are hot

anyway it was time to make a decis for dinner the choic was to either have dinner with my fellow cowork from outoftown at this place or eat by myself at anoth hotel buffet ugh not another

so simpl enough join the group

th view is inde spectacular and the servic attent  

but and a big but the menu was predict and bore consist of your typic redmeat black angus schmangus shit salmon and sea bass woohoo and pair it with side like garlic mash potato good gawd  asparagus yippe plus salad caesar told you theyr predict and soup lobster bisqu oh come on dessert creme bruleelord almighty

i got the lamb chop which was ehh okay but cook a bit too rare

it a revolv restaur so pleas do yourself a favor and mind how much you drink  becaus i dont want to pick you 1000 feet down your pea brain splatter all over the sidewalk nor smell your fuck puke in the elev 104 floor up  and dont get lost go around in circl tri to find the restroom it alway been on the same spot it the tabl where your seat that move dumbass

good thing it on compani expens becaus im not go to spend this much money on this place 

minus 1 more star for the looong ass way get to this restaur and stop frisk me alreadi im not go to bomb stratospher you tsa wannabi think about 50 of the bill is go toward the atmospher  the food is not outstand  we went with the 5 cours tast menu sinc i couldnt justifi pay 60 for an a la cart steak when i could just go to carnevino down the street

w still had a fun time and the servic was excel  the jazz band was a nice touch and it was great watch peopl do the sky jump  definit a tourist trap though  restaurantcom coupon help the bill hurt less  but im pretti sure this will be the onlylast time i eat here  dinner some place els and then the bar here all the way next timelook great and high class from the outsid but the qualiti and tast of the seafood is on par with red lobster 

 oyster platter  dozen  16  i think they were stingray oyster sinc the waitress said they were from virginia not the freshest a veri basic introductori oyster veri mild not brini or too sweet and sinc theyr found on the cheasapeak estuari they tast like they were mix with freshwat  

littl tip  you can tell the qualiti of the oyter your go to get by the qualiti of the lemon that come with these lemon had blemish all over and werent a full bright yellow 

 linguin w clam solid portion good enough for 2 tast like how it should but noth to warrant 4 star  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosoqi2rglajkdotaacelbagselectymy1lhrpcsdzogdnybp94a  

solid seafood from a landlock state with a cool look oyster bar i guess all the freshest seafood goe to the strip httpwwwyelpcombizphotosoqi2rglajkdotaacelbagselectlos1xgywmjlj9vhssyzhaayc sushi pop head up

that light bulb in my head shine bright when i heard we were head to an ayc sushi place  more 

this restaur locat in an outdoor shop malloutlet in vega made me yearn for sushi as i saw their sushi display they had other section such as a soup section miso soup etc hot food with mussel noodl etc but all i care for besid dessert was just  sushi  everyth look good but there werent ani label of what exact each sushi was luckili i had an eye for sushi be that i love sushi and was abl to distinguish what each roll had everyth look fresh or so i thought 

as i sat down i devour well tri to devour each roll i couldnt eat everyth from each piec of sushi becaus geez there was so much rice cmon peopl where is my fishi didnt pay for rice i liter had a pile of rice chunk on my plate just so i didnt get full off of rice i need to make room for other thing like dessert plus the fish didnt feel or tast fresh at all but i guess that happen when your at an ayc sushi buffet more if youv been to todai then makino is like or perhap a littl bit better than todai qualiti of sushi i honest dont think my 1695 wkend lunch price was worth it but i did eat it ani way and manag to eat some of the tempura shrimp they had which werent that bad 

the best thing that this place offer besid good servic was their dessert yes there are cooki mini cake that are what ever but they have green tea ice cream and drum roll pls red bean ice cream one of my favorit flavor ever oh man i felt like i was in red bean green tea heaven i have never in my life been to a place that offer all you can eat green tea and red bean ice cream nom nom nom is exact what you heard after go back two time to get more of it too bad it wasnt mochi or i would have stuck with dessert the whole time i was thereafter 35 yrs i final decid to give sushi a tri  i told the better half tbh that i want to give it a shot and she suggest we come here so that i can have a good select to choos from  i dont eat seatfood and have never had raw fish until now  tbh and my friend all love sushi and i kind of feel bad when we have to make differ plan becaus of meso here we are

i was veri nervous as we enter the joint and tbh was great becaus she didnt pressur me to tri anyth in particular  i was starvin like marvin but my appetit sudden disappear as we walk in  after get setup with ginger wasabi soy sauc jalapeno soy sauc i brows the sushi buffet line

i decid that i was go to take it slow and onli tri a few thingsso i went for tuna salmon unagi 2 roll i have no idea what they were stuf tempura jalapeno spici tuna cucumb rice thingi and some tempura fri roll thingi  sorri i dont know the name but took pic so im sure if your a sushi enthusiast youll know exact what it is

i enjoy the tuna salmon unagi  spici tunath other stuff i didnt care for  i dip it in a soy saucewasabi mix that tbh help me makeand it help with the tast  tbh told me to eat some ginger everi onc in a whilewhich was a blast of freakin flavorwasnt expect that and choke on it  

i have no idea how to base a rate on sushi sinc this was my 1st timeso to me the experi was aok 3 star  i wish they had label on the sushi they didntoveral i enjoy myself and will eat sushi again  i want to give other seafood a tri now

wil i return  i think so5 plus star for decor i am a sucker for that whole post modern retro  vintag look  love it i  love the john deer tractor in the dine room and the old wood everywher  i love that it still look like a store front and has a rich red paint on the insid i love the cafeteria style serv with the old fashion look to it i even ador the old retro soda in a tin 

but i have to say 3 star for food  the rib did not have the flavor that i crave  with rib i  see  and smell the smokinessbut there was almost too much sweet with the overbear sauc it was nice but not delici  the coleslaw tast like they ran down to smart and final and bought the big bag of coleslaw mix and the jar of coleslaw dress bore and bland  
the mac and chees howev was super  yummo bake with a cheesi crunchi top that made it  comfort food i also realli like the cornbread not too sweet not too bland  and honey butter veri delish 
we also had an interest dessert sweet potato crunch that i am still ponder  a mash of sweet potato with a creami textur with a bit of nut and brown sugar ice cream cut the rich  

i want to ador joe i want to say it an all around winner  i want to sit in the restaur and enjoy the decor but mayb i ll go for the cornbread 

hey parentsth kid menu is a rib sandwich which wouldnt have been a hit with my kiddostay at the nyni hotel we decid to tri it out for breakfast

i had the crab cake egg benedict it was pretti good but noth about it stood out nor was it bad 

the restaur was decent and i would not make it ani sort of a destin but wouldnt mind drop in were i around in the vicinmet some friend here for drink and to hang out for a bit  the joint is tuck away on the 2nd floor of harrah in the back near the entranc to the monorail  it too small to be a clubabout 12 the size of gilley  

the food here is ok bar food  our friend order some wing and i sampl a fewthey werent bad just ok  same goe for the fri  sinc i didnt pay i didnt catch the price

th waitress are suppos to be cutehotbut onli 12 of them were  the other look a littl sloppi  i hate say that but if your go to put your staff in sexi outfit id make sure they are abl to meet high standardsespeci in vegas

overal the foodexperi was just ok  the best part is the music  the joint feel veri touristi  id give it anoth chanc under the right circumstances

return factor  50the minut i walk in i felt like i was in thailand  no wait i felt like i was in japan  no wait i felt like i was in vietnam  if an independ restaur could steal anyth from american corpor restaur it is this ident crisi  

let get one thing straight thai basil doe not serv thai food  they serv asianstyl american food  howev i feel that thai basil even despit the name advertis itself as a fusion restaur abov everyth els  normal i am hard on nonauthent thai restaur but this one realli is just an asian fusion restaur thus i will rate it as such

w order the thai ice tea the drunken noodl 595 panang wbeef 595 the thai basil chicken 695 and a philadelphia roll just to tri  we also tri the cream chees wonton which were a slight better version of the one you would get at pickup stix although they were a littl bit over cook  they came with a nonhomemad sugari sweet and sour sauc that didnt realli impress me  they also offer pho here and it probabl the onli pho in all of north las vega  

the thai ice tea was the first clue that this wasnt a thai restaur  it was normal brew coffe over ice with a lot of sugar in it  i could feel the slight heat from the fresh brew coffe as the ice cool it down  the second hint was that they had soy sauc but no real thai chili pepper or fish sauc  they brought us a thin ground chili powder and some sort of chili flake upon our request for thai chili powder  

the food wasnt bad but it wasnt great  the beef panang was light sweet perhap a littl too sweet for some hardcor curri lover  while it was a thicksoupi consist it had a definit indian flavor to it  the beef was veri tender although perhap a littl bit fatti  the thai basil chicken was more of a chines dish with a veri light but sweet marin sauc on it along with cabbag  the chicken was well prepar and veri tender  there was no spice involv in the dish as one might suspect from a thai dish  probabl the worst item that we had was the drunken noodl  the noodl were a flat noodl that you would see in american chines restaur and the sauc was pretti flavorless  the noodl were too dri 

the philadelphia roll wasnt bad at all  i am not an expert on sushi but it seem fresh and they stuf a lot of salmon and cream chees in the roll if this were a pure thai restaur i would give them 2 star for the thai food  howev sinc this is more of a fusion restaur and the food was for the most part accept i am give a generous 3 star the price are also extrem cheap although the portion are a littl bit on the smaller side compar to other restaur  i would consid come back for the sushi but definit not the thai foodlast thursday i had the pleasur of join a bunch of yelper at a uye here  i had not been here in over 10 year and they have move east on glendal a bit sinc then  at that time they were out of sauerbraten so they serv us a stew of sort that wasnt on the menu and i rememb it be quit good and larg plate of food

i still desir to tri their sauerbraten so that is what i order  it come with a potato dumpl gravi and red cabbag  i expect a piec of beef marin for three day to not requir a knife to cut and to have some flavor of it own befor dows it in gravi and sauerbraten i have had befor met this  this one to me was quit chewi and the gravi too sweet  gravi is one of those thing that just becaus i think it is too sweet doesnt make it bad or improp made it just didnt suit my tast  if i had like the gravi better it would have improv my imag of the dumpl which without gravi was sort of tasteless  the red cabbag was just as i expect and have had before

now that i have grumbl about my meal  i got a bite of a big pretzel two of which the restaur comp us  i thought it was a bit salti but overal a veri pleasant surpris  i chose to tri mine with butter  the bread pud was delici i chose the small size and it was easili enough for two to share but i ate it all anyway   all of this food was wash down with a good tast spaten lager  the servic was pretti good especi for our larg group  and they were will to split the check which even with a parti of about 18 did not have the mandatori ad gratuiti although i doubt if anybodi in our parti tip less than 18 becaus they was noth wrong with the servic to warrant a poor tip  the owner didnt introduc himself but he did make a coupl of appear on the patio to see how thing were going

i could easili be entic to come back to the patio and enjoy a beer  i think i would opt for one of the appet like a pretzel or the potato pancak to soak the beer up withhaus murphi is fun place place to go for german meal and it has a lot of fan  i found them to be a littl date with their decor and their food is usual cook well done or over cook  their servic is aok

food feedback
app  
sausag sampler bratwurstkrakauerwurst serv over a bed of homemad sauerkraut is tasti 
potato cake  serv with a side of appl sauc and sour cream was a bit overcook veri dri 
the giant bavarian pretzel import 10oz salt pretzel is high over rate and was not cook even 

meal  
their beef  pork sausag are all serv over their homemad sauerkraut with german potato salad or fries
bier bratwurst  beefpork sausag is good
german bratwurst  pork sausag is bland
krakau wurst  polish spici beefpork sausag is awesom 

their schnitzel are good but again overcook at time i prefer their steak schnitzel top with a gorgonzola chees and roast onion sauc  serv with german fri potato and bacon roast green bean 

beers
spaten lager or weihenstephan hefeweizen are best you cant go wrong herecame here to verifi that the sisig was as good as everybodi claim it to be i gotta say that they were spot on 

me and the wifey came on a thursday night at about 915 first thing i notic as we walk in was the blare music they were play and peopl that were danc ballroom style for a second i thought we went in through the wrong door becaus outsid it wasnt mark clear 

onc we were greet by the hostess and was led to our tabl we werent too sure if we should eat there or take our food to go sinc we realli didnt want to wait til we got home to eat we decid to toler the club style ambianc and order it for there im kind of glad we stay becaus what happen next was realli someth you cant forget

w order pork sisig and tokwat baboy as we were wait for our order we were watch all the peep that were on the danc floor do their thing now i wasnt sure if this was a typic thursday night becaus upon look further we notic the crowd was a mix of young and old folk the dj was play a mix of fast move song from the 60s to today didnt matter what he play everybodi on the danc floor did their thing what realli caught my eye was when they play gangnam style i kid you not i swear i saw at least 2 old ladi that could have been my grandma do the danc like they were psi themselv wow dinner and a show

so we final get our food if you refer to my pic these two dish alon could have fed at least 4 peopl so we knew we were gonna have leftov for the next day which wasnt a bad thing of cours we had steam rice to go along with it so if you think we were gonna eat it just by itself than you are so wrong

servic was mediocr our server came by everi so often to check up on us but it seem like forev in between those times

th food itself was definit worth it just go there onli thing is i think it a bit pricey the sisig was 13 buck and the tokwat baboy was 11 buck at some other filipino place it was definit cheaper

so in my opinion if you dont mind the loud blare music and the out of tune karaok singer then eat here should be ok for you otherwis call ahead and get your food to goi stop in at jerri for breakfast this morn  i havent been here sinc the 1980s  in walk through the casino i was surpris at how much nicer it seem to me than it did year ago  sinc it was morn ti wasnt veri crowd with peopl at slot and there wasnt a lot of smoke to bother me

i look at the menu care check the yelp review and then order huevo ranchero  i got the egg over easi and i opt for corn tortilla  jerri was veri quiet  in a short time my breakfast was brought  when i order my server ask if i want mild or hot salsa  i chose the hot  jerri doesnt know hot salsa unless someon put the wrong salsa in the small dish she brought  

there was a larg serv of refri bean with some taco chip in the bean  the egg were done correct and the entir dish was cover in chop fresh tomato and lettuc shreds

mi server mami was veri pleasant and compet  she was back quick with the coffe pot to refil my cup  the breakfast was larg veri fill and good but there was noth that would make this stand out abov other huevo ranchero ive had

i would like to go back sometim in the afternoon and get their strawberri ring for dinner  it look so good in the front case as did mani of the other pastri includ giant eclairs

jerri is aok818
came to tri oliv  ivi happi hour w 50 app and salad and select wine by the glass  didnt know which wine i want to have and had to ask if i could sampl a few befor order a glass  mani server in other restaur and wine bar automat offer sampl befor you buy but not here  leav a bad tast in my mouth pun intend when i have to ask  settl on a columbia valley riesl 8 but 4 dure hh  8 bottl sold at costco
 
for app i had the chop mediterranean salad orig 9 and the antipasti of prosciutto di parma orig 14 price on websit arent current  the chop salad was fantast love the couscous and feta chees  for me this was a meal by itself  had i known beforehand i place the two order at the same time how satisfi id be w this and my glass of wine id not have order the antipasti platter which frank i didnt favor too much  the platter consist of prosciutto di parma chorizo spanish sausag two chees a blue chees from rogu creameri and a goat chees midnight moon two kind of oliv almond and housemad grissini breadstick whole food sell a few tasti varieti  of this platter item i onli like the goat chees  whole food sell midnight moon  the blue chees was veri salti and so were the chorizo piec  i onli like the cure meat panfri when the excess fat can be drain off and the meat acquir the crispi i crave

should you want to tri the antipasti platter yourself be awar that oliv  ivi daili select vari and you may not have ani say on which two youll get  i think it great to stumbl onto a great new chees but perhap those with allergi say penicillin may not want to tri a new blue chees as some blue chees varieti are ferment with penicillin bacteria  it would be great if oliv  ivi would give custom a chanc to either roll the dice and not know beforehand or offer them a chanc to choos from a limit selectim sad to say that my veri first meal in arizona was a bit of a letdown admit the set is pretti scenic but i kind of felt like i was in a suburban upscal mall restaur that was tri to be more chic and happen than it could ever hope to be 

i went with a cobb salad which should have been a simpl choic but the leav seem a bit wilt and the entir serv just a tad bland even after a hefti dose of pepper on my part 

still servic was relat fast and friend so if i work nearbi i can see how this could be an alright spot to keep on one lunch circuit no doubt about it the best thing go here is the waterfrontit was 1030 pm on a tue night and after a few drink at a nearbi bar i was get a littl hungryso i jump on yelp and look for a nearbi place to grab some grub  i found this sandwich shop and walk a coupl of block to check it out

aft look at the menu for a minut i decid that i want a philli cheesesteak sandwich wwhiz  jalapeno  after wait a few minut they brought out my sandwich  the sandwich had a ton of whiz on it which is greatbut it was light on the meat  usual place put too much meat on their steak sandwichesnot here  i know jalapeno isnt part of a tradit steak sandwichand my friend from philli wouldv kill me for order it that way but i couldnt help myselfi love to spice it up a bit

th jalapeno were pretti spici and ad to the flavor in my opiniongood proport of pepper  the steak was kind of bland and the bread was just ok  ive had better steak sandwichesbut this did the job

wil i return  probabl nottheir qualiti suffer when the crowd come in at 12 am

go in the afternoon for their 550a good dealnew locat 3 star qualiti foodeveryth we had here was just ok the serv were larg the shrimp farfall was good and came with quit a few larg and yummi shrimp the thai chicken pasta need more of a kick the jalapeno in the saute scallop were a littl too over power and the pot roast special was pretti big but not veri memor my favorit part of the meal was the cheesecak we had for dessert the servic was great our server check back often enough to make sure our drink were never empti  

im not sure well come back there noth that realli stood out for me that made this place memor enough for a return visithad lunch here today  was bum to learn that whatsherbucket from hell kitchen doesnt work here ani more  i wonder if the food wouldv been ani more wow if she did  the restaur is love and the server veri help although in the interest of full disclosur i should note that we were dine with hotel staff so   
the food was okay  we start with an antipasti platter with oliv the size of my head giant block of parmesan the size of my torso and roast pepper and artichok heart both standard size  i also had a yummi piec of bread with chees and herb bake on top dunk in oil and vinegar  a simpl mix green salad was nice dress up by chuck some of the item from the antipasti platter on top  the pasta was okay the chicken was okay the green were too bitter for my tast but my fellow diner love them and the salmon
th tiramisu was serious good with a sticki consist to the mascarpon cream that made it super easi for me to imagin how well itll stick to my hip  i onli had three bite and im pretti sure i can see them right where i imagin them go with the rest of the carb i careless wolf downthis is anoth spot we check out due to high yelp ratings
w start out some chowda and fanni bay rock which was tasty

next we share the combin pan roast almost everyon rave about

th food is decent but not great  sinc phoenix has veri limit food choic at the airport i like chili too out of all the other options

th servic here is borderlin terribl though the employe are not veri friend and their realli slow

overal id give it 25 star but round up becaus im in a good mood today

return factor  7535 star with room to improve

rec had a love dinner at vincitorio with yelp pal jim and audrey w  although there was a problem with our reserv not be carri over from one notebook to anoth huh it was easili correct with a short well mayb not so short wait  while wait i caught a glimps of their patio which look veri promis for a futur visit

onc seat we were soon greet with tasti garlic bread  im sure at some point they consid charg us for the bread given our repeat request for refil  our server was not onli knowledg about the menu but veri familiar with the wine list as well  when i ask for a descript of my chosen verdicchio his descript was spoton and i was not disappointed

i was somewhat disappoint with my entre salmon  shrimp vincitorio  describ as fresh atlant salmon filet and jumbo shrimp saute with mushroom leek in our light cream sauc with a touch of tomato serv over fettuccin i was a littl surpris to find more than a touch of tomato  it was more of a tomato cream sauc although still light and veri good  the fettuccin was delici even though i dont believ this particular pasta is handmad  my complaint is with the seafood the salmon filet were actual piec of filet which would have been okay had they not been so dri  the jumbo shrimp consist of 3 shrimp which were also slight overdon  at 1995 this may have been the priciest item on the menu but probabl was not the best

dessert was definit the star of the show  the tiramisu was not onli a generous portion it was fantast  the panna cotta was smooth and creami with no gelatin textur  the gelato cover in a chocol shell was like a gourmet version of a dq dip cone  this was probabl my favorit  i would return to vincitorio for the dessert alonaudreyrlwyatt and i  canyonjunki  met good yelpphx friend heather c and ryan c for dinner some time ago  i realli am remiss in catch up my reviews

i will tri to do better in the futur and as penanc i will ufc sever orang heads

anyway ill cut to the chase and break down vinci torio thus

dessert         5 stars
dinn           3 stars
servic          4 stars
atmospher   4 stars

that make a total of 16  mayb someday ill put togeth some sort of restaur score matrix with weight categori rankings

great dessert veri good servic and ambianc the dinner entre were good but did not wow mei was in the mood for pizzanot crappi junk pizza but a nice pie that i could sit down with and eat with a knife and fork if i want to  after drop off my wife and daughter at the movi it was a mommydaught movi night i began search   

vincitorio right here next to the movi theatr  okay let tri this

good servic check
outdoor seat with those big gas heater thingi on chilli night check
nic ambianc check
good pizza check

keep in mind that just a check and not a star for the pizza  there was littl or no sauc on this pizza which kept me from enjoy it as much as i would have like to  not a bad tast and mayb you will like it better than i did but i like sauci pizza and they dont have them here i guess unless you ask for them

everyth was fresh and the pizza was wellmad with a nice crust  no issu there  the three star is from the pizza snob in me who want that burst of spice tomato tast along with the pepperoni and sausag  nonetheless i ate until i was stuf  ill come back some time to see how the pasta isstop here unexpect last night friday and was seat at a fourtop even though it was pretti busi indoor  i dont recal the name of my server but he was oh so veri patient w me as he tri to answer my food allergi concern with everyth from beer to specialti and the fish and chip turn out his exgirlfriend had food allergi too 

i ask him for a beer recommend sinc ive onli start to appreci beer ive alway like fruiti cocktail and sweet wine  ive never like the tast of beer although i did enjoy the sip of san miguel light beer mix with sprite or sevenup that relat would let slip for us kiddi to tri  howev with microbreweri and season brew aplenti i find that beertast and see which one match well with food can be as much fun as winetast  sound like ive done a lot of beertast huh  i can count the time i had a coupl sip of beer on one hand  but i digress  my server suggest a blue moon which i almost didnt get to tri sinc it look like i was allerg to everi dish i select hed go to the back to doublecheck  i think he could see i was about to bolt bec he sudden appear with a cold glass of blue moon wc came w an orang slice

sinc i didnt want to leav with an open bar ticket unpaid i decid to throw caution to the wind and order the fish and chip platter even though the kitchen couldnt confirm that the batter was free  am i glad i did  the platter took about 20 minut to arriv but when it did i was happili munch away on crispi freshtast beerbatt haddock wc i sprinkl with fresh lemon juic and occasion dip in tartar sauc  yessir i was realli live on the edg now  allergi be damn  i even sampl the itsybitsi side of coleslaw wc im pretti sure had  in the dress  oh and the beer tast fine  so much so i almost bought a sixpack from sunflow a coupl of day later

il be back to tri other specialti and their burger of which mac is famous forthe mexiamerimenu you expect
not realli anyth especi bad or especi nice to say
chip warm and fresh but salsa was kind of jarof picantelik bleh
larg portion great couponroosevelt has great food awesom music and for phoenix a killa beer select the bar onli seat about 7 or 8 peopl which is pretti lame for a tavern but if you can get a seat relax drink a beer and enjoy a random western oh yeah on sunday roosevelt rock an all day happi hour which is pretti radi know some peopl reaaalllllyyyyyy love the roosevelt  i like it
th atmospher is great  i love the wood throughout especi in the front of the house
on big tabl  this is a pretti popular spot  there was a fair larg parti at the big tabl and i was meet at least 4 other peopl  there was some space at the end so we took a seat and i was inward hope they left soon  there is definit room for a small corner tabl or two in this back room  whi arent there any
th food was under the headlin snack and i was a bit scare of that becaus i was starv and the price werent snack price  i had the grill chees and tomato soup  both were excel  they use gruyer and fontina chees  the tomato soup tast fresh and had small basil leav in it  it was fill enough for be a snack
im not sure if anyon order it but a bowl of potato chip and two differ dip came out after we had eaten  one of the dip was bleu chees and divine
th bathroom  blech  it was veri coldnot as in temperatur but it did not go with the rest of the place  it felt institut  plain white wall with 8 nail in a row on one wall  kind of random sinc the nail werent far enough apart to hang anyth on them
servic was ok a bit confus  we had two differ women serv us and one claim this is onli my third shift  dont tell us that  make us think you know what your dook look i understand that anyth can becom a cult classic when a few peopl known to be cool deem it magic  pictur somebodi you realli like and want to be your friend say these thing in a realli annoy dramat tone oh my god i have to have it right now  this is the best thing on the planet  dude your insan if you dont love this  i bet you can guess what im refer to by now it is inde the infam grill chees and tomato soup snack boner over by pretti much everybodi ive ever met in cenpho  now ill be honest ive onli been to the roosevelt twice and actual had a good time both time but i had to give it 3 star for a coupl littl nitpicki thing as well as the fact that im antibandwagon when it come to sport and food  

realli  i had better tomato soup on continent airlin for christ sake  i am not a big soup eater but ive alway appreci tomato soup for it dipabl and simplic  i dont need a full salad of basil in the soup and honest i found it kinda wateri  again mayb it just becaus of the peopl who it got bent over tell me how bomb it is but all i could think was meh  

i can also cook a better grill chees with the bread from tent citi dont worri about whi i know what the tent citi bread is like on a linoleum countertop with a cloth iron while get rob attack by a wild boar which i would subdu with the iron and nag by the super annoy chick that i mistaken date for a coupl week last year  im not a foodi so i dont rememb specif what kind of bread and chees were use but i do rememb waaaay to much of said bread and not near enough chees for 8 buck  8 buck  send me to safeway fuck that food citi with 8 buck and ill make you a grill chees and tomato soup that will leav you beg for a cigarett  

but i digress  actual overal i like the roosevelt  the high top tabl were ricketi as shit and the littl candl on the tabl serv more as a way for me to burn myself test my manhood by hold my hand over it than a light sourc  the place itself is cute and ive alway like place that have a homey feel  our waitress was wonder and even gave us some in depth info on where they get some of their ingredi  i have one more gripe and it that i was appar an asshol for ask for a bourbon and not know befor i step insid that they onli serv beer and wine  the bartend look at me like i was a moron which she has everi right to do bc shes dead on and told me to rethink my select of wild turkey on the rock  i love oak creek so i was pleas to see that they carri it but i think they probabl lose the busi of some peopl look for a cocktail

so im more than confid that you will enjoy the roosevelt but if somebodi tell you that youll never have a better grill chees in your life go in with the mental that theyr just make sure that the chickdud theyr lust after think they have good tast  youll never get her anyway brosephill probabl ruffl a few feather amongst the yelp communiti but ive been enough time to offer an opinion  i applaud the mission and idea of essenc  we need more of these place  but everi dish that ive gotten has been just slight abov averag  grant there is still more menu to explor but the higher price dont justifi the risk  
i hate the feel of come to this place look at my dish look at my wallet look across the street at the dread starbuck and think i would have save a few buck and gotten a better breakfast over thereyou know i love essenc but becaus i am a regular who sometim visit twice in the same day like today i have to say that i am sick of their bad custom servic no i am sick of their crappi attitud 

the peopl at the front end of the hous are either incompet or rude  with one except the ladi with glass and short dark hair she has alway been help and nice i dont want her lump into this review she is the onli good front end employe left in this place at least she is the onli one from the old crew ive seen on my last sever visit the rest of this younger new bunch have such an aw disposit and way of say thing that i am no longer go to be an essenc regular   

here is how today lunch visit went

they were out of the lunch special 
they sub an item in my backup order without notifi me 
they were out of the caesar dress on my cowork caesar salad and it took 40 minut of wait to realiz this
it took 40 minut befor the food was readi and we even call ahead
no one apolog for this
whil we wait we watch one of the chef liter toss food onto the counter in annoy whenev she had complet someon order
th bread was so hard i couldnt eat it and the knife they gave me couldnt cut through it either
th man help us was physic annoy by the lunch rush and couldnt be bother to treat custom like they matter 

on top of that no one greet us with a smile everyon had an attitud and made sure to say thing in the bitchiest way possibl what the hell is go on are the employe treat terribl i feel like it so bad that it must be an intern problem and not exact indic of the person natur of the employe themselv it almost feel like a product of the environ unhappi employeesthey dont give a shit about your busi just say  

it been real essenc weve had some great memori but it over  and it definit not me it you hope one day we can be friend again i will certain mourn the loss of my belov macaron

upd i was sent a veri sincer note from the manag i will say that they definit reach out to make everyth right hope the custom servic issu will improv becaus i love everyth els i think 2 star was a littl harsh so im give them a 3 for be so gracious after read my review  ok essenc we might have to give it anoth go i just cant quit youid realli like to like this place more than i do  central phoenix notic lack italian restaur if your not count oregano and pizza place and harley italian bistro is in a great gentrifi stretch of 7th ave melros on 7th to realli impress as a neighborhood italian joint but it fall a bit short

i made my second ventur here the other night for dinner  it was a last minut sort of thing so we luck out that we were abl to get a tabl anywher on a friday night  i had a hunch that harley might be somewhat busi but not terribl busi to the point of long wait  

we stroll up to find about 13 of 20 or so tabl occupi  but even if it was too busi it wouldnt have been awkward sinc we could have pass the time at the homey and spacious bar in the back  lot of differ type of diner reflect of the area  most older marri coupl and tabl of gay singl and a young famili or two with kid 

the food was ok  we order the fri calamari with marinara to start and it was unev and uneven  some of it too chewi  i order the salcicc al penn and my friend order the spaghetti with meatbal  oh yes  he onli got two meatbal btw  my dish was alright  i felt the sauc could have been a bit more flavor and spici  my first visit was with a larg parti of 10 and i order the crust chicken romano sandwich  veri good but a tad on the greasi side 

the server was ok  veri friend but he felt new and seem awkward at time  he forgot the parmesan chees when he brought out our entre and was diffcult to flag down to ask for the chees  so we sat there and stare at our food befor we were abl to dig in 

ill go back  but if anoth italian restaur open nearbi harley will have a run for their money

fyi it been open for about two year now  and was known as the roman tabl for mani year befor thati order chen and wok for take out on saturday i must say it was pretti darn good i will give it an aok for now even a 35 but will return to tri more dish im sure it will creep to 4 stars

what i order 

sweet and sour chicken slight dissapoint becaus there wasnt a lot of sweet and sour sauc on the chicken chunk but overal pretti tasty

veget egg foo yung yummi the sauc that it came in wasnt just a plain brown gravi it was an actual sauc with ginger and other season that took it out of the bore realm

hous lomein that was pretti good the noodl were a littl soggi but still flavorful

hous fri rice i would suggest get ani of the other fri rice that they offer i was hope for a good mix of all the meat but onli end up with 2 shrimp out of the entir carton other than that the rice was good i actual realli like it

egg roll i love a well season egg roll i onli ate one but wish i had order a lot more or didnt have to share my other one oh well 

for about 30 dollar i was abl to feed 3 peopl huge plate of food and still had leftov 

i think chen and wok will be my new chines takeout from now ontoo often my enthusiasm for chines food detract from my abil to say anyth meaning about the establish 

i order get food eat food rant and rave about food find out that nobodi share my opinion of said food rins repeat

with near ident menus and servic i was have a hard time find someth interest meaning and most import funni to say about ani of these place it was start to cramp my style and i fear that chines food would prove to be the knight that slay the mighti jetta dragon 

i bet you all peg me as the unicorn type huh

chen and wok broke what could have been an otherwis endless repeat cycl of pointless review by be popular with peopl i knew and give me someth to critic them for their service

first let me start off this review by lay down the obligatori though not undeserv lip service

th food is pretti fuck fantast ever sinc my cowork and i discov their menu at the bottom of our take out menu drawer weve been eat that shit like it go out of style

norm just the sight of steam rice make me flail my arm and scream in tongu but after that spici kung pao or hous chicken hit me and my stomach balloon with burn and gas im grate that im not be tempt with a side of lo mein i usual keep a shamrock mmmmmmilk nearbi whenev i order anyth denot on the menu as spici onc i experi with chocol milk 

turn out chocol milk and kung pao sauc get along like leather daddi and mountainbik enthusiast amic yet jar indiffer 

look up ani takeout menu from ani other chines place pick five random item cw has it and it fuck delici 

the food is so good that it warrant the often mindfuck tedious task of deal with the staff for now at least

i admit off the bat that i have a skew perspect in my group of cowork i am the offici cw ambassador

i can tell the differ between chow mein and lo mein so appar that qualifi me to be a fuck interpret of the culture

on day not too long ago the it depart manag to pull ourselv away from japanes bug fight and star war done entir in termin long enough to decid that we were hungri we want chines and that although jetta was in no mood to be yell at over the phone she was a bitch and deserv it anyway

i call in the order and was greet by my friend asian ladi with the inappropri loud voic who after rush me through my order and snap at me when i tri to explain for the fifth time now where our offic was locat would interrupt my give of the credit card number by recit number that in no shape way or form resembl the one i gave her you know to keep me on my toes

on of the peopl on my order realli want chow mein with his orang chicken chines restaur legendari person grudg with special order and substitut asid i thought that if we just ask for some on the side and not substitut for their flavorless white rice mayb they would take advantag of the opportun to provid someth resembl custom servic and make a few extra bucks

w all know how this end right

th ladi argu with me for a while and then she argu with claric for a while and eventu we compromis we have to buy a whole entre of chicken chow mein so our friend can eat the noodl 

needl to say my credit card compani love cw

perhap to punish me for my insol c dub send an obnoxi and easili confus driver in a bad im go to communiti colleg to learn how to be a game show host suit in lieu of our modest and veri smiley normal deliveri guy 

the driver refus to park in the park lot and instead drive in circl around the park lot wait for me to meet him after i spend 6 minut on the phone just beg him to park and wait for me i spend anoth 10 wait for him to finish his victori laps

aft botch my name onc or twice how do you get liberti out of jetta theyr not even made by the same manufactur he hand me two plastic bag which he has tie togeth am i suppos to slump it over my shoulder hobo style and drive off 

onc insid i find my entre to be so spici it make my nose run and my rice to be even colder and more flavorless than usual 

hell hath no furi like a chines place inconvenienced

al in all chen and wok is still the peoriaarea chines takeout for me 

but believ me when i say ive never been so happi and excit to see the goodcent girl walk toward our officmy fella and i came here dure a weekday for dinner we had purchas the travelzoo deal for two buffet with unlimit beer and wine 

the place was realli dead we came at a veri off hour hope to avoid crowd and we success did this the staff was attent and friend and we never had to remind them for refil or to clear our plate the line is kept veri clean which is a must when i visit buffet they dont have a lot of select and it kind of difficult to find some thing sinc everyth is spread our so far apart they take minimalist design to the max they onli have 4 or five dish to choos from for each type of food which is a littl bit of a letdown buffet should be all about select and they dont have a lot of choic 

the food was standard noth amaz but there were a few standout i did enjoy the salad bar they allow you to pick all the ingredi you want and they mix them for you that was probabl my favorit part of the meal the dessert were limit as well i end up with macaroon they were veri good warm and chewi definit anoth highlight of the evening

i have to note that our beer were over carbon and both my fella and i couldnt even finish half of our glass it was bud light which was expect but it was so bubbl it tast aw 

for the price we didnt feel rip off but we definit wont be go out of our way to return overal we had a pleasant experi but it not one of the better buffet on the strip by ani stretch of the imagin the food is realli two star but the servic bump it up to three star for mewatch your receipt

b wari about the receipt you leav at the tabl befor get your food as someon might take it and use it for themselves

thi just happen to us this morn 10am 122411 tabl at the end of buffet line

aft be seat my wife and i went to get food and left our server copi receipt on the tabl when we return we found anoth coupl sit at our tabl i was polit and told them we were sit there and we had spread the tablecloth and silverwar out to make it look occupi i had assum the waiter took the receipt for our drink and assum a coupl was sat at our tabl in error

sinc i couldnt find the waiter i had to find anoth waitress that someon was sit in our seat and was told by said waitress that she need to see my receipt i told them i thought the waiter took it was tri to find him and that some coupl was seat our table

whil complain to that waitress my wife approach our origin tabl and is wonder whi some other coupl is sit at our tabl while tri to call me she see the ladi at the tabl rip up our receipt my wife grab it from her and the ladi glare at her 

i went back to tri and take a pictur of the coupl but they had alreadi been ask to leav luckili we got our receipt with our name and room number back 

mi wife and i assum that this is probabl not the first time this coupl has done this and that there are probabl more that know about this and do it also next time we figur one of us would have to stay at the tabl while the other got food 

we thought the food was ok but the ambianc was suck food was definit not worth have to quarrel and hassl over 

in vega it just one of those hard luck stori it just that who woulda thought it would be at the buffet and not on the casino floorthe waunaqueen and i drop by fleme on a sunday even for a glass of wine a coupl of appet and a great view of the sunset over the west side of madison with a coupl of former cowork  as mention in other review there is a subset of item from the drink and appet menu avail for 6 between 5pm and 7pm

we order a coupl glass of the vinedo terranobl sauvignon blanc the bake brie and the french onion soup just befor the end of happi hour  the wine came recommend by a wine blog i follow and it was the right choic for the set and a decent valu at 6 a glass  

the bake brie was a disappoint  just brie bake in a less thancrispi puff pastri shell  the chees lack that earthi flavor and need a boost whether from a sauc or some ad herb  the gala appl serv with the dish start to brown by the time we receiv our plate

th french onion soup 12 also disappoint  this dish is good test for a restaur  it take time and skill to coax the natur sweet out of the onion  rush the dish and it is bland cook the onion with too much heat and they becom bitter  cook the onion slowli at low heat and you are reward with a wonder caramel that provid deep rich flavor  the fleme version of this soup was on the bland side of the spectrum with it thin broth  the bake gruyèr and parmesan chees top was well execut and ad a much need punch of flavor

our group enjoy the patio set at fleme  despit sit near the bustl intersect of univers and midval there was veri littl traffic nois to interrupt our convers  our server was effici but less than enthusiast  at happi hour price it fit the aok definit of a three star rate primarili due to the set and the wine list  outsid of happi hour i probabl will go elsewher to find more satisfi food options

upd after post this review i did get a messag from the restaur manag apolog that my happi hour experi with them fell short  her messag was sincer  appreci that i took the time to provid feedback  i then spoke with the manag on the phone and becaus of that posit interact i do plan on return to fleme  it a favor sign when a restaur use feedback from their patron to improvyelp is right again  35 star for this place is exact the meal i got  i was hope that most of the low rate here were base on the oh my it soooo expens i can get spaghetti  meatbal at my local mom and pop place back home for 750  i hate those review  yes it go to be expens here you are on the strip and that whi the meatbal are like 16  they are also the size of softbal  if i can throw a meatbal at you and possibl knock you unconsci if we can play dodg ball with itif i have the urg to put three finger in it and im look for pin and a laneif i can chain it to a prison leg and keep him from escapingif a meatbal can do ani of those thing then you can charg me 16 for two of them  

now all of that brag said it didnt tast as good as my local mom and pop place back home for 750  yes im that guy  tomato sauc base italian food is comfort food  some italian grandma has made all these dish for her whole life and has been taught them by her grandma and will pass them on to her grandchildren who will all open restaur in your citi  they wont charg you an arm and a leg for them and you will eat them all the time  they will be realli good  so if i walk into an italian restaur in caesar palac where you need a reserv in advanc im go to hold them to a higher standard and im expect to be realli wow  i wasnt it was just ok

for starter we had bake stuf clam  these smell great but the clam was pretti tough to get out of the shell as clam can be  the stuf was way way overdon with fresh oregano  you could tast noth els just oregano bread stuf plus with the clam hang onto it shell for dear life when you scoop out the clam shell all you got was the stuf  the clam was left behind  2 star for this appetizer

mi dish was the best at the tabl ossobucco alla milanes  i would give it 4 star  it was nice and tender shank of veal cut veri thick  it was serv on top of saffron risotto and in a tradit tomato veget sauc  there was a small fork place in the bone marrow for sampl  i enjoy the flavor of the bone marrow but im not a fan of the textur of it  if you eat at rao i would recommend this dish  

mi brother got a beauti look veal parmesan  this was serv bone in and was impress to look at as it cover the entir larg plate  unfortun it flavor didnt match it look  it was also tough  not terribl but not great either3 star  

mi wife had ricotta purs with sage and butter  although the pasta was cook nice the ricotta chees was kind of sweet and somehow the sage butter lack the savori element to offset it  just recent we had a similar ravioli style sage butter sauc dish at angelini osteria in hollywood ca  that dish was so magic but this one was veri blah  again 3 star  

one other strang bit of info is that rao is decor for christma year round  i ask about this and was told that at the origin rao in new york they never got around to take the christma decor down one year so it becam a joke that they would just leav them up  when they open this las vega locat they kept that tradition

so there you go as with most restaur on the strip rao is 3 star food at 5 star pricelayer use to be next to trader joe on sunset and green valley i went a coupl of time and was blown away by their pastri and the wonder atmospher in the place so i was veri excit to learn that they were reloc their store down the street from us unfortun sinc the new locat has been open there have been mani minor disappoint ad up for starter theyv expand their menu to includ sandwich salad and soup the atmospher is now that of an eateri cold and uninvit and the savori food is overpr and deepli mediocr 

they are clear brilliant at prepar bake good and perhap they should have stuck with what they are good at ive had sever of the sandwich all are greasi and over heavi i have a veri adventur palett and i alway appreci more experiment cook when it done right unfortun the flavor and textur combin here are bizzar and inappropri at best 

there is a chicken sandwich with smoke cheddar serv on heavili butter oatmeal molass bread with bacon caramel appl and over sweet caramel onion the descript claim that it would be serv with bbq sauc which could have allevi the bland heavi same of the flavor but what we got instead was someth closer to mole with definit hint of cinnamon and cocoa the sauc by itself was interest but it had no busi on that sandwich ive also had their meatloaf the flavor of which is good in itself but is again serv on over butter bread with noth to give the palett a rest from all that heaviness

th truth is that their bake good are still fantast and they have what i think is the best coffe in town i could just not have lunch there and focus on the posit right well the custom servic is chaotic and disorgan and border on rude order get forgotten and no thought is given to littl thing like if you get your coffe and your pastri first and the pastri is heat up and sit on the tabl while you get through lunch it go to be hard as a rock by the time you get to it  at ani given time there are 4 or 5 peopl behind the counter at what is a fair small establish so be overwhelm is not an excus also for the price you would think that the food could at least be brought to your tabl this place is not cheap all minor thing that make it a less than stellar experi 

it pain me to write this review i am alway veri excit about mom and pop place and i want them to succeed i want to like this place 

the last straw came this past week when layer post a discuss on facebook about a custom that complain about the tast of an order and expect an exchang or refund it seem that they feel that their food is abov reproach and that the basic rule of custom servic dont appli to them blame the custom for have bad tast when they dont like your product is not a smart approach and in this case it succeed in turn off at least two addit custom my bf and myself that were tri veri hard to give this place a chanc 

i wont be return ani time sooni dont get to glendal veri often but i head over to bravi for a tweetup this afternoon and i end up stay a bit after to get some work done  

the restaur is locat in a newer look shop center off of union hill and 59th avenu  the servic was fine and the restaur itself was clean and welcom  i saw there were a hand of peopl dine outsid on the patio while i was there 

i cant be too critic sinc all i had was a mediterranean salad togo and a diet coke with a few refil  jare and i had the salad along with an acorn squash and bake cod for dinner and it was fresh enough for both of us and aok in my book  will i rush back no  but the rest of the menu look appeal and if i am ever in glendal seek somewher to get some grub or a glass of wine id glad returnoverpr duhhhit the wynn deli all the usual suspect in delistyl sandwich for around 12 each friessid not included

th gem here is the vegan burger for 9 you basic get a vegan happi meal a littl gardein cheeseburg that tasteslook just like those littl mcdonald burger a side of french fri and a littl chocol shake it a fill meal and alllll veganwhich is great for me becaus i looooov me some milkshak but my inabl to digest lactos normal make them an ugli proposition

it not realli gourmet foodiefoodbut it solid good for be vegan  and the price is great i will probabl have this againwe came here for happi hour one even 4 star of cours we have to check it out

they have happi hour from 47 for food we order the bruschetta and the melanzan ripieni the bruschetta was ok it was just main tomato on it i felt like a slice of chees with it wouldv been perfect it was no meat friday again so these item were perfect the melanzan was good it bake and fill with eggplant chees zucchini etc i felt they could use some more item on their appet menu it main all seafood mussel calamari scallop etc 

for the drink i was kind of shock that they dont have a drink menu they dont have a regular drink menu wine menu or anyth you basic tell them what you want and that it the first time i order a strawberri martini while my friend got a cosmo then we told our waitress can you just have the bartend mix up a fruiti martini im not sure what was in it but it was realli good the good news is their martini are realli good and theyr a steal 4 

i would realli recommend have a drink menu though mayb throw some specialti drink on it along with a wine list and perhap expand the happi hour menu with the appet id come back for a martini though for a price like that my parent rare take themselv out  im grate to have the chanc to treat them to a nice outing whenev i can i was plan on take my father out to dinner at wick spoon for father day but by the time he got off work that place would be close sinc i took off work i thought fleme would be the next best thing to tri without worri about the time i took the last reserv at 9pm  we were prompt seat upon arriv the hostess was welcom ask how im do and how my day was which was a pleasant to hear she also inform me whos my server  wish us both to have a nice dinner  actual wish my father  happi father day to you sir my father lit up  said thank you thank you that sure brought a smile on his face and to wit that brought a smile to mine great job to this hostess

it took a few moment for our server sarah to greet us  by that time we were alreadi readi to order we both decid to get their prime rib dinner it come with a choic of salad one side  one dessert like father like daughter we order everyth the same 

fleme salad  not spectacular or anyth to rave about there were too much slice purpl onion which i had to put asid the dri cranberri crouton  tomato were just okay extrem simpl  look cheap the candi walnut were over cover with rock hard caramel that i warn my father to watch out in consum it you could liter hear me crack the candi part in my mouth  it wasnt a good feel against my teeth the best part the dress was tangi  fresh the present itself wasnt appeal at all 

bake potato fulli load  as the side we chose it was the best in our entir meal my father note that it was his first time ever see such an enorm size potato  all it fixin it came exact in this order of top on the bake potato sour cream butter green onion bacon  cheddar chees as be a happi surpris in the veri end as you dig insid we enjoy this veri much  it was one of the most flavor fulli load bake potato i ever tast each bite i couldnt believ how delici it was everi top compliment one anoth  it was like a joy ride of warm gooey good in it highest form i cant tell you enough how much i love this side if i can give 5 star alon to one food item i tast here this would definit be it even my father goe this prime rib isnt the best but this bake potato is

prim rib  it come with three sauc on the side which consist of spici mustard horseradish  au jus i felt the au jus was too heavi in flavor  one bite with this sauc was overpow the natur flavor of the meat i did enjoy mix the spici mustard which wasnt spici at all where you get ani heat with the horseradish sauc which was also veri light like sour cream tast to it the combin of these two sauc went great with the prime rib i order mine medium  it was cook perfect my favorit part the dark end were in depth with flavor  i love the tender of the meat overal i thought this was an excel entre i would definit order this again

dessert time you have to order their signatur sweet chocol lava cake we both learn the hard way you can easili be complet full  satisfi with one order easi it come with a thin cookielik holder with two generous scoop of vanilla ice cream insid  top with chop pistachio nut next to it is the rich chocol cake with a molten chocol center of belgian warm chocol bake to order which take 20 min to make one of my favorit dessert it also come with a side of chantilli cream which is the next best thing to slice bread so fresh whip light  tast like a whip vanilla bean ice cream sooooo soooooo good everi bite i took i ad this cream with my cake heaven i am known to finish all my meal but i could onli eat half this portion when the server first present this dessert to you youll just be amaz how much you get it like a whole meal dessert style then sugar coma set in  you have to reevalu your desir to finish it all or throw in the towel i threw in the towel  rest my head back waaaaay too much for lil ole me even my heart was race 

three mishap want to take our leftov home but the runner threw away half my dinner damn it i love that bake potato oh well next time i want the togo contain  bag it myself second have to wait for a long time for our entre to come out felt rush third be charg for both side 17 when it includ in the prime rib dinner i didnt catch it at first but caught it after talli 20 tip  give my signatur you would think if i order that special you would know not to charg the side right hmm honest mistak as anoth yelper note no such thingive been to fleme probabl a dozen time in san diego and rancho cucamonga  this is my first time to the las vega locat  the set up size vibe and servic is as consist as it get but that not necessarili a good thing  im fine with the servic and ambianc for the most part  my onli issu is the nois  tough to enjoy your steak and compani when all you hear is everyon convers  regardless i still had a decent dinner with the gf here the other night 

as for my meal i have never deviat from their 8 oz petit filet mignon  befor dinner i scope out the menu and contempl on someth differ  but guess what i chose the petit filet again  the steak was decent size but was a littl disappoint on the overal tast i got my steak mediumwel and thought it was too pink as for tast i thought it was just aok  for a pinkish steak i thought it tast burnt i dont know if it was fleme or if my tast in steak have chang price is about what you expect at a steakhous  howev ive had better steak with the same price point  

overal will i be back  im sure i will one day  mayb next time ill tri their lobster or seafood

p  their mushroom ravioli is phenomenover the past 4 year ive been here numer time for a varieti of occas a date busi dinner birthday celebr  the servic is fantast the set and decor devinebut the food just doesnt stack up against better known steakhous and with virtual the same price point  the locat insid the red rock hotel make it an easypeasi no hassl offstrip choicemight be the onli reason to choos it especi if your stay at the hotel or if conveni to summerlin resid  for me have an appet or a drink at the insid bar or better yet  the beauti outdoor bar with a firepit larg sofa and chair  is absolut terrif  for the main cours id take my busi elsewhere

a tip for park is to valet park on the backsid the hotel entranc with just a short walk thru the hotel lobbi and either up the stair pass the outstand chandeli or 1 floor up in the elevatortak you right to the tbone entranccame here for happi hour last night ive actual eaten at this restaur 3 time befor so my review will touch on all those visit combined
look at the happi houra limit select of bar food all at 10 i didnt order ani but the group i was with did most select the bbq beef slider that look like a decent valu ahi tuna taco look small i had 2 bloodi mari at 8 each 
i havent ever been a fan of their food on 3 visit it just wasnt that good or spectacular consid the price my last steak here was over 2 year ago so thing chang go with the more recent reviews
it is a beauti restaur with a great outdoor patio seat areabar and some tabl outsid for dine as well i love the ambianc and locat servic for happi hour was pretti good onli one waitress but she did a great jobi hate be the first person to review a restaur when i have a below par experi but here it goe  the vig is a veri cool space  if you are designmind you will be veri exit to see how this nondescript brick shoebox has been transform into a hip happen bar and restaur  the bar is dim lit live and boast a huge plasma for watch game  it is the antipostini if you know what i mean and it is just the neighborhood hangout i have been search for not that i have anyth against postino i go there all the time the vibe here is just distinct differ so my review for the bar onli is 4 stars

ok now onto the hard part  the food is bad  the onli redeem qualiti is that it is also pretti cheap so you can almost forgiv the misstep  the frenchi french dip sandwich could have been from arbi  the smoke salmon appet tast like a concoct i could make at home  a slice of lox on a sliver of safewayqu french bread top with a squirt of thousand island not that i would ever subject myself to that at home veri disappoint  the grill veggi plate was pretti good but it was serv with a bad vinaigrett that tast suspici like bottl italian salad dress  food rate 2 star  

in sum this place is a mix bag  it is a welcom addit to the neighborhood and i will certain be back for drink but i would go elsewher for dinnerwhile plan our trip to vega a coupl of my friend suggest start our night off with a bang by check out n9ne befor go out to a club  consid we were alreadi plan on head to rain and ghostbar it made sens sinc theyr all at the palm  plus sinc my friend had heard some good thing about it it sound like it was worth tryingand yelping

when our parti of 10 arriv we were taken to our tabl almost immediatelyoff to a good start  the decor is pretti nice  chic and contemporari just like what you would expect from a hipper steakhous  the menu was a bit overwhelm with so much to choos from but it got easier when i rule out the nonbeef entre we were at a steakhous after all  while half the tabl pair up to split the bonein ribey for two i was stuck go solobut i realli want the same thing this is where a gf would be handi  so instead order the 24oz bonein ribey medium rare while get the lobster mash potato to split with my buddy

th potato were pretti awesom and probabl my favorit part of the meal  not onli could you tast the lobster but there were chunk of it in the dish too  impress compar to what ive had in the past  as for the steak i knew it was go to be hefti though part of the weight was tie to the bone but it still surpass what i expect  it look fantast when it was brought out though   the surfac had a nice char and grillmark to it  there wasnt a lot of fat hang off the meat but it was still juici when i cut into it  i wish it had been more tender but the tast was great

although the steak was good for the most part i did have one hangup with it  as i work my way toward the center by the bone the meat look less like medium rare and more like rare  when i glanc over at my friend steak to compar them i saw that his had the same problem  we both debat on send our plate back which i dont typic do so that they could fire it a bit more but we figur it wouldnt be worth it  there wasnt much meat left on the bone anyway and the rest of our tabl was just about done  still you would think that for a higher end steakhous they should at least be abl to cook their steak more even than that

b that we were all pretti full from the meal none of us had ani room for dessert despit a coupl that sound rather entic  the whole restaur can get pretti noisi but i realli like the chill yet trendi vibediffer for a steakhous  sad the uneven cook was a downer  i dont have a huge problem with spend money for a pricier meal and this place is pricey but for 60 they could at least cook it better  id be open to come back again but i would rather tri a new spot like craftsteak first  ifwhen i do come back again ill be sure to check the meat befor i start eatin keep with the thought that i need a treat today i stop by my favorit scottsdal cupcak store lulus
i didnt say my favorit cupcak store tc you know who you are and your delight but my favorit in scottsdale
they had a special on today 2 for 1 so i brought one home for the beauti carin and then cut them half so i could have 12 of blond bombshel and 12 of pb hold the jelli 
they also had a dcup cake i do so love doubl entent but strang enough it didnt realli look so hot
anyway both cupcak were good and just what i need to restor balanc to my life esp for the extrem reason price of 300 for 2the bb was moist and ice rich and flavor if you can truli say that vanilla is flavorfulwhich i doprob someth to do with my norwegian heritage
i thought the pb was less success the cake was a littl dri whi do so mani cupcak place and bakeri for the matter have troubl make a moist chocol cake the ice while tasti had that littl bit of crust that say ive been sit here a littl too long
but both were good and lulus is my go to when i dont want to leav scottsdal for a cupcakaok

iv enjoy takeout from siu wok four time now and havent been disappoint veri inexpens for the amount of food you get i have creat 3 meal from one lunch special the pepper steak was realli yummi and perfect spici the kung pao steak was quit good as well as the szechuan chicken im notic a spici trend here 

the lunch special are serv with fri rice an egg roll and 2 crab puff the onli thing that annoy me was the crab puff ok  not onli is there no crab in them there isnt even a hint of krab in them you dig call them what they are cream chees puff thank you ill eat them anyway no need for decept 

yesterday i had the teriyaki chicken for lunch i question it immedi becaus it look interest i actual joke to my lunch date about what i was eat and that i didnt believ it was chicken at all but in fact the victim of some ghetto backyard dove massacr ala i was wrong im just not use to eat onli dark meat chicken and let me tell you it was fuck delici 

in closing
good cheap eats
cream chees treats
bomb dark meats

now if onli they had crush icetri to decid where to dine in vega is like tri to decid what one item of cloth to take from the vogu fashion closet  serious  on our first night in vega for convent we decid to stay at the hotel mirag sinc we were pretti tire  japonai had a promis menu so we made reservations

servic was friend and effici  i order two sushi roll which were good  the tempura app was also tasti  i would have like to have had time to sit in the loung area pre dinner but i was a littl busi engag in some retail therapi    all in all japonai is a nice place to grab a bite to eatit not even worth bitch about a place be overpr and pretenti if it locat in a strip casino and has a fruiti french name those blatant red flag should be all the warn you need

but sinc i like to bitch here goe a friend and i had enough sushi  sashimi to fill us both plus one seawe salad and one miso soup and a share dessert for this we paid over 200 64 of it was sake so that mean about 140 for a good but not except sushi dinner the servic was good the food was good and the ambianc was sort of dark upscal chic white tablecloth sort of hush atmospher no window slight claustrophob midcasino locat conveni locat amidst a sea of slot machines

obvi one could do better offstripbut if you find yourself strand at the mirag and in desper need of sushi this place will do it just not veri exciti like it  the food was most veri good the servic was good in a hurri sort of way and the price are reasonable

w ate on a weekday even and the place was bustling

in the valley of the sun zs greek at 40th and indian school continu to be the standard bearer for this sort of cuisin and phoenicia doe not measur up but they are solid enough that i would return

i would add someth clever and greek or middl eastern here but ive got noth right now so your out of luck

if you like send me a compliment with someth good and i will add it to the review and credit youtire of plain old golden corral  ok here an oddbal buffet for you  this midsiz restaur is nice insid with an appropri tropicalrattan look to it that give it a backhom in the pi look  i have visit the philippin a number of time  love it over there so when norm r suggest a visit to tri the lunch buffet here i was all for it in spite of the veri low previous rate for the place here on yelp  mike c join in  the three of us head over there to get our fair share of abus to quot mick jagger

i start with some nice americanish fruit salad  then it was on to a bowl of sinigang na hipon which is a chicken broth soup with whole shrimp  a few other thing in it  it was good onc i delet the front half of each shrimp  i dont like anim look back at me as im eat them  next was some good kinilaw which is a spici raw fish dish similar to ceviché  then there was ampalaya ginisa main ingredi bittermelon  beef piec pansit similar to lo mein lechon kawali deep fri pork belli plus sarsa a dip sauc lumpia similar to a spring roll just a littl dinuguan pork stew in gravi that is thicken with blood  eek  but it tast ok  i also enjoy some tapa think rehydr beef jerki two kind of rice  more

with a nice san miguel beer on the side this made for an interest buffet meal  it serv cafeteria style  id say it strict for the adventur diner so you might want to leav the kid home for this one

weekday buffet lunch 899 764 sri had dinner here last weekend with friend and share a coupl of dish we start the meal with delici crispi calamar then went on to nilagang baka boil beef and veggi sisig a spici pork dish relyenong talong roast eggplant cover with ground pork and scrambl egg and fri chicken the portion were generous the dish were good and with rice it turn out to be too much food for the three of us mean we had some pretti good food to take home it was saturday night so there was also latin danc instruct be given on the danc floor at the end of the restaur with sever peopl enthusiast tri out the step be taught 

i came back today to tri the lunch buffet with fellow yelper rand h and mike  c the restaur decid to ventur into offer a lunch buffet option onli recent so i guess they are still feel their way around in this field the select of viand was limit especi if your use to go to chines buffet i like the dinuguan pork stew in pork blood this could be a bit daunt for the uniniti the lechon kawali deep fri pork belli the tapa thin slice beef fri in garlic the ampalaya bittermelon with beef and the kinilaw the filipino version of cevich some of the dish could have use some tweak the lumpia spring roll could have been a bit more crisp and the pancit noodl had an overcook textur  

come for the regular menu for lunch and dinner the buffet also offer authent filipino dish and will hope incorpor the need tweak in some dish as they get more accustom to offer this option four star for the regular menu three star for the lunch buffet at this pointthis place is disgust i would have live a long happi life not have enter loco patron the crowd is creepi alcohol douchey jock stereotyp frat boy and sad hyster hos the insid is so dark you can bare see the person opposit you and the tone of the place is set when you arriv for dinner at 7pm and are card 

so whi on earth am i give this place 3 star well it realli 25 but honest the food was solid middl of the road tex mex and the portion were larg for their price make the meal i had a valu the 650 quesadilla with green chili was made with what can onli be describ as the world largest tortilla it had to be a 30 one becaus it was fold over and still look enorm there wasnt too much chees in it but enough to not feel stingi though the accompani guac and pico de gallo was not near enough for the magnitud of that quesadilla we were in on a tuesday night which is 12 taco night and i did tri the mahi mahi taco on the soft corn tortilla and like it i dont realli like mahi mahi becaus it regular cook to death and tast like noth but the top made it a nice 2 treat 

if someon brought this food to your hous and serv it to you without tell you where it was from you would enjoy it but loco patron is a charmless restaurantbar that should be avoidon the douch scale of afflict to ed hardythi place fall at skater jersey status  i didnt have ani food so i cant comment on that but man the atmospher suck  i wouldnt have gone here on my own but my friend told me he had a corona light wait for me  liar  i had to order it when i got there  the drink were fineyou cant realli screw up a bottl beer  but the waitress look like they hate life and the doorman was complet unnecessari  back the fuck off bro  you dont own anythadd this spot to your list of place to consum multipl cold one other than that this spot is onli just ok loco patron is an oldi but goodi in the fact that it been around for awhil and continu to be decent it straight across the board decent which isnt necessarili bad do they have decent food yes do they have decent drink yes do they have a decent crowd on occas 

if you are look for a taco tuesday spot a spot to day drink and a spot to enjoy a night out with friend this is an option to considswung by here for drink after work with friend  we were amaz at how mani peopl were here on a tuesday night  the place was busi  the music is loud which is perfect for the atmospher and vibe here

sinc we alreadi had dinner we were onli here for cold beer  i had a dos xx lager and the rest of the group had heineken

servic here was soso  our server start out well by get us our drink right away but she wasnt too attent as the night went onw had to flag her down whenev we need a refill

although we werent eat we receiv complimentari chip  salsathey were averag  the salsa is veri mild no kick to it at allwhat i like to call tomato sauc salsa

il have to come back and tri the food

return factor  70head to the heart of las vegass chinatown im check out harbor palac seafood restaur for their dim sum  it about 1 pm on a saturday and this restaur isnt as busi as i had hope  not a good sign

mi friend and her dine companion are alreadi enjoy their pineappl bun with egg custard when we arriv this is definit a good sign  im not sure if the bun were hot when they came out sinc i arriv a bit late  i enjoy the sweet of the custard but the bf found it to be too sweet for him

w order their standard shrimp dumpl and pork dumpl  both were standard  they even had the shanghai dumpl readili avail as well  they were tastier than orchid garden version that for sure httpwwwyelpcombizjur1iiejufwyckfdfy1gqhridau3rp30fnjmzdi1eksag  and sinc the red vinegar is left out on the tabl you can feel free to drown it as much as youd like

w also had chines broccoli shrimp on tofu crabshrimp puff thing shrimp rice noodl and chicken feet in black bean sauc  all were pretti good  we even had the salt and pepper shrimp that came right out of the kitchen so it was nice and hot  

the downsid  servic was blah i mean realli blah  the ladi never smile or show ani person whatsoev  and the guy work there were not that great either  they refil our teapot but left it on the far end of the tabl out of our reach  one ladi was veri indiffer as she slid our order across our tabl  they were quick to clean up our plate onc the bill was settl which can be a good or bad thing  it usual mean they want you out of their fast so they can have the tabl back

instead of send the cart to the back for refil they have waiter carri a bunch of dish in their hand or stack them up and then place them on a the cart  im not so sure this is visual appeal  

the bill was about 40 for four not includ tip  we found this to be a bit more expens than orchid garden and chang hong kong cuisin sinc we know we ate less here  the bf wasnt so sure we got the correct bill even sinc the guy handl all the check seem quit unorganized

overal the select was there although lack in dessert  i did see the sweet tofu come out but no custard tart  they did have a few thing that some of the other dim sum restaur didnt seem to have  sometim you get the feel they are realli tri to push a dish on you  i mean how often can the conge ladi come by ask if we want conge  becaus the restaur is a bit smaller and they dont push the cart into the back youll find the ladi idl by one side of the restaur which was pretti much hang out by our tabl  they could realli use a lesson or two in custom servic  if they can fix this a bit i might even be will to give them a better score rather than a stiff 3 starfirst off for those that are confus  the steak at this restaur do not actual strip nor is this a strip club although there are sever pole in the area which some guest seem to enjoy climb onto

anyway when you enter this palac your initi greet by a waiter who while nice has just enough condescens and general annoy at your hope great and perhap alcohol induc mood to let it show that the first mistak these guy are not fun theyr here to give you their song and danc on their steak and other assort bit and piec you better pay attention

and so they dofirst we spank the cow for 30 day until she is good and angri and then we marin her in a garlic oliv oil arugula salad while poke her with a pitch fork in a tub of fatreduc sherri chutney on top of a mound of butter farm by orphan in canadaok not exact but that what it sound like to me it actual hard not to laugh at how serious they take their ridicul and unnecessari explan and i think that i did and that made our guy a littl upset just someth not quit eleg about all these littl detail 

and then you see lobster fritter on the menu and you come full circl with the classless mess that is stripsteak where my fondest hope was that the cow would inde disrob at the end of the story

th lobster fritter i person did not order them were ok kind of tast like from frozen but better qualiti than weight watcher they come with creme fraich so if your look to die of heart diseas befor your 30 lbs of red meat this is the appet to get

oyst were also just ok not fishi but just not great and for 1520 buck they should have been great that is they also onli carri kumamoto i believ or some other mini japanesey thing dude steakhous  we need man oyster here save these for your fake sushi bar in the center of the hotel and they need it

steak do not come with condiment so for a 5060 dollar steak assum anoth 2030 buck in potato andor veggi i had the scallop someth or other which was all in all  gross

th steak rib itself was good was it 60 dollar good no but one of the better thing to eat at mandalay and that not say much

they also keep tri to push their stupid fake kobe beef on you man  it not kobe kobe beef is made under stringent and incred condit in japan and american wont let it in the countri as i hear this is american fobe so dont get suck in the cow did not drink ani beer befor get massag and tattoo like they do in tokyo 

the other thing we notic is that it the busboy both here and at china grill that do the place justic from a servic perspect our busboy busman realli  victor was awesom fun polit respect and free of that ever present vegascondescend elitist attitud that is spread around the hotel and inhal by most staff members

if you need to have steak at mandalay go here if you dont want to walk for 4 minut to charli palmer at the adjoin 4 season otherwis walk on bynot a big fan the bar is fair larg with sever room though all are pretti dumpi not so much in the old school gooddiv kinda way the crowd is somewhat interest drink are pretti strong but smallish price are fair no smoke patio here  go outsid the front door and wave at car on mcdowel while you puff

i have yet to dine here

i did see a band play here recent and that was pretti decent without a band  no thankthese folk pour a drink for 3 on saturday they have daili special and the saturday special is 3 soco or three oliv saturday also offer a turkey cheeseburg and fri for 5 but i didnt tri it you can see all their special by hover your cursor over the day of the week on their home page httpwww16thstindexhtml

it was not crowd when we cruis in for the sun devil game this past weekend we were greet by a guest who ask if we had a reserv and then holler to the waitress who said there may be a wait at least they have a sens of humor

th advantag for us was we got to take our pick of the tv we want to view the game there were two texa hold em poker tabl go not my thing so i dont know specif and i saw pool tabl in a separ area  photo on the websit make it look like there shuffleboard too

definit look forward to go back it was a great place to watch a game ill have to tri the food next time and mayb theyll get a bump to 4 star although i observ their nacho are real chees nacho and im a fake chees nacho girl so im gonna have to pick anoth game day foodwent there yesterday to watch a postseason game with other yelper  as far as watch tvs went there wasnt a bad seat in the hous  for those that hate smoke there is a non smoke entranc in the back to the bar side but if you want to play pool or use the men room you still have to run the gauntlet of the smoke patio  speak of the men room i have seen wors but this one wasnt realli kept up that well and it could use a mop as my feet stuck to the floor by the urin 

they had plenti of good choic for beer on tap  i was intend on a burger but tabl quantiti of other stuff arriv  the nacho were ok  i dont normal care for hot wing becaus they are well hot  these were grill and while they left a slight after burn for me were realli quit good  i also had an onion ring a potato skin and a chees stick  good solid bar food without be wow  servic bounc between realli good and where did she go  they were out of stuff like ice tea some browni and some of the beer  as a tabl we were buy enough drink that those that mix in glass of water were not questioned

al in all a good solid neighborhood barthis is actual not a bad buffet for a smaller type of las vega style buffet for 10 you got yourself a pretti tast buffet with prime rib pasta station that make great pasta hamburg grill station that grill and build your burger the way you want it plenti of fresh fruit and veggi a few chines entre some mexican drink includ  and the rest of the salad bar their dessert tabl is not bad lot of varieti along with ice cream  on the holiday they brought out the prime rib and charg an addiditon 2 per person not bad at all their prime rib tast just as good as wynn buffet prime rib

honest how much can one eat at a buffet bar im stuf with a piec of prime rib and a piec of chicken pay 3040 for a buffet realli is not worth it for our famili of smaller appetit so well stop by here to grab a 10 buffet and substitut with the other grand one 
10 and 7 with a player card no wait hour in line food is pretti decent and save goe to the slot machin   

ive eaten at some of those cheapi buffet in vega and this one top everyon of themehish 

i will say this  most of their food was good but in my opinion it was veri overpr for a reason unknown to me i think sometim it becaus it closer to the strip we paid almost 200 that a lot of money in my opinion i have a hard time with it becaus i can get just as good indian food in a 100 compar locat nearby

w came here on friday night with some friend we had 4 dish 2 appet and 5 drink total 

we had  

3 beers
1 wine
1 martini
stuf mushroom  veri weird for me it was a veri blunt tast of curri yogurt and a uncook mushroom that was breaded
saag paneer  veri good
shrimp tikka masala  sauc was veri tasti and rich 
lamb rogan josh  the sauc was okay i felt they use a littl too much curri and it over power the dish with that and nutmeg
chicken mukhani  we actual dont think this was the right dish it came out and the sauc didnt tast like it normal would for chicken mukhani it was a bit thinner and not thick like butter chicken typic is 
lamb vindaloo  good flavor nice and tender meat 

overal  the servic was not good it took us over an hour to get all of our food main becaus the waiter was not come around to ask if we were readi to order it was not busi mayb 56 tabl total on friday night at 7 it pack at a lot of place so that could be a sign if theyr not busi 
again the food was good  not amaz for a pricier menu the locat and the build itself doe not call for higher price neither doe the servic3 food 4 fun

aft a long afternoon walk the strip bear the juli heat sarah e and i decid on a clean and refresh sushi dinner for the night especi after do well and walk away with a littl extra cash from a fun run at pai gow poker

sushi might not be the first thing to come to mind in the middl of the desert but it vegas

w step into grand wok  sushi bar rather than seek out the betterr shibuya also locat somewher in mgm the place was busi with peopl though be a tuesday even it seem like everyth was wind down a littl early

th host was congeni seat us at the sushi bar with a smile while one member of the waitstaff brought by hot hand towel our friend waitress eager await our order 

first order of busi as ever sake and beer

brows the menu we order the sea dragon negihama and aloha roll  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosntfdrwvlub3nmwdmdpjq0qselectwavf1ie6e7vzxxr1kqtzw  to accompani our sakebeersakeb the sushi itself isnt particular rave worthi but it decent in qualiti and quantiti the aloha roll tuna yellowtail salmon  over spici tuna satisfi the negihama yellowtail over scallion is simpl and clean while the sea dragon danc on the tastebud with both garlicki kick and sweet sauce

on food alon grand woksushi is okay but the treat of the even was sit at the bar and watch the masteri of sushiprepar yoshi httpwwwyelpcombizphotosntfdrwvlub3nmwdmdpjq0qselectlidb5efyccewfskkqhw  we sat there watch in admir as he prepar order after order of sushi and sashimi at the end of the even as yoshi was prepar and order of glisten fatti toro he notic our awe drooli want and treat us to a coupl of meltinyourmouth slices

end the even on a high note and an unexpect morsel of fatti tuna good fourth star

if you walk away from a tabl even consid it a win
w walk away up25 stars

korean own and oper  this place is ok  it the onli shabushabu place ive been to in las vega  

the kobe chuck was pretti good but the seafood was a littl underwhelm  also got the mushroom plate  fresh enough

on thing i like was the wasabi octopus appet  it hard to find raw octopus in vegas

servic was great  extrem friend and help girl behind the counter 

i felt it was overpr  75 with tip for two notsohungri guy  eh  

id probabl go back if fiend shabushabuwell ive still got my sock in case you were wondering

i order the rosemari chicken which was marin chicken breast roast red potato brie roast red pepper and fresh rosemari serv with a side of mustard cream sauc see pics

il just call this like i see it so dont hate glorifi hot pocket anyone

it wasnt bad at all but it wasnt the great and power oz either
i thought it was just ok i wish it would have been hotter also mayb that would have made the difference
  
we even decid on the strawberri pavlova for dessert which is homemad meringu shell strawberri kiwi  fresh whip cream finish with raspberri coulé see pics

ugh that was just plain awfulov ripen and flavorless kiwi zero sugar whip cream and stale meringu all at a tad abov room temperatur and we were still charg for it

despit the fact that upon leav i said i couldnt care whether or not i ever ate here againi probabl will give it anoth tri becaus i realli want it to be better than it was 
 
mayb it would be better if i got them to go and bake them at home

i still dont think it was great enough to have a line out the door youd think they were bake 100 dollar bill into these thing or somethi dont get it

sen has 4 12 star with over 100 review  it michelin rate  what it doesnt have is food to match  

our parti of five was eager to tri what was purport one of the best sushi restaur in town  we drove all the way from hendo  in rush hour traffic  just to eat here  on the way we decid that we should do the omakas and let the chef put his best foot forward  here what was served

1  yellowtail with pepper and garlic chip  the present was wonder but the flavor were overpow  the ponzu was too strong for such a subtl fish  the addit of garlic and a spici habanero or jalapeno just kill ani chanc you can tast the fish let alon feel the textur of it while your mouth burn  

2  mizuna salad with salmon tuna and albacor  this would have been a nice dish had it come befor the spice of the yellowtail  in fact this is how good fresh fish should be serv with veri littl detract  as an individu dish howev id rather just have thick cut of sashimi instead of thin cut of fish with a salad on the side  

3  soy miso block cod  realli good execut of one of my favorit  onli downsid was that i didnt have a bowl of rice to go with it  by itself it was suprem tasti and buttery

4  fliet mignon tataki  this was good and tender but lost in sauc  fliet has zero flavor profil so cover it with ani sauc realli just make the meat a sauc deliveri vehicl  chalk it up to person prefer also a person prefer i would realli have like it to be medium rare rather than medium well  

5  miso soup with clam  delici  this was the highlight of the meal  the combin of clam and miso just hit the right note or flavor and smell  realli good stuff  i could have just had a coupl bowl of this with miso cod and call it a night

6  nigiri  the fish look and tast fresh but the textur of the salmon was slight mushi  the rice was realli good with just the right about of koshi that make me happi  1 for the rice

7  chocol souffl with green tea ice cream  i love green tea ice cream and this didnt disappoint  the souffl howev was anoth matter  it was hard and nowher near as fluffi or light as it should be  imho if you offer it on your menu you need to execut it well or dont bother

b hungri after all that we order two addit rolls

8  24 shrimp tempura with tuna on top with pineappl wasabi  this is one of my least favorit rollsev  the sushi itself probabl was good but the sauc kill ani chanc me want to take anoth bite  it was too sweet and too much of it all over the roll  

9  25 california roll with soft shell crab  this one at onc pretti good and also fair standard  id probabl choos this if i didnt know what els to try

i like this place but it a tough sell at 4 star  out of 9 item onli 2 stood out as thing i would make it a point to order again  

ive read the review  ive heard the rave  i final tri sen  i just dont get what the fuss is all aboutalmost couldnt find it  a few month ago i had seen the sign as i was drive by and after research it i ad it to the list of place i want to tri for lunch  in that time they move back to their old locat next door and the sign move with them and is harder to spot from the street  there is a larg differ in size between the two suit and after a year of deal with an economi that is poor they gave in and move back  that leav them with onli 4 small tabl  as i was the onli custom at the time that wasnt a problem

i had never been in there befor and was greet like an old friend by everybodi  the whole atmospher of the place feel like everybodi enjoy be there

i had the friday special of beef tip bean potato salad and i upgrad the roll to corn bread  to drink i had an unsweeten ice tea  total was 1239 includ tax for a big pile of food  when the waitress ask if i had save room for desert all i could do was laugh  sever of the side seem to be purchas and someth serv me was warm in the microwav  what their specialti is is the meat  tender but still just a touch chewi the way i like my q  sauc doe not get ad until it is serv  i am sure the cornbread was bake there and i like it becaus it is not veri sweet  for a small place they have a larg menu  so far and i will tri some other menu item this is the best q i have found this far west and the onli decent one i can get to dure a lunch

th park lot is a littl hard to navig with a full size truck if it is close to full  that contribut to a 3 instead of a 4 along with the purchas sideoh i had hope for this littl hole in the wall rememb they were tasti at the cajun festiv  i decid to be adventur friday after work and get some down home cook for the famili  my appetit was readi for pull pork and cole slaw and mayb a tasti side  

when enter the ladi at the counter was veri nice and it obvious they work hard to make this place have a varieti of  soul food  
but when  i got home i to sad report that it wasnt realli tasti  noth memor  noth surpris just  tast like food i d get at a church chicken stand and the cole slaw which i had realli been crave was the disast of the meal  not season not tasti  just green cabbag with a wateri  sourish tast 
brisket and pull pork were okay  roll were serv with the food which appear to be store bought low end parker hous  blah 
daughter had fri chicken   and took a bite and didnt care for the over cook driness  

oh well lesson learn  glad to tri  but no  new littl bbq joint place for meill tell you my littl secret but you have to promis not to tell promis 

i have been recommend wichcraft to everyon who has been go to vega  dont tell anyon but the closest ive come to a wichcraft sandwich was through a tv screen  ive never actual eaten there and have been project the delici becaus of my love for top chef

that is until now 

when my cowork told me to meet her at wichcraft for a quick lunch befor leav vega i liter ran there as fast as i could as i drag my suitcas from mont carlo to mgm in the desert heat i was excit final i was go to pop my wichcraft cherry

th avail all day breakfast and warm lunch sandwich look tasti but i was quick sandwich pressur into get the warm turkey sandwich with avocado bacon and balsam onion and mayo on a roll  our vega driver has been dream about the turkey sandwich sinc decemb and was adam that we tri it as our first wichcraft sandwich  in the interest of not anger our driver and risk be left strand in vega we all got the turkey sandwich   it was delici the balsam onion avocado and bacon were a tasti combin 

except i have a new littl secret  dont tell anyon that went to vega with me  if you do ill deni it  i had food envi the whole time i was eat my dri bore although tasti turkey sandwich i was secret dream about the meatloaf and want to get that instead

i guess there alway the next trip until then 35 star for good and quick sandwichus egg is a place i can count on for sunday brunch near home when i dont feel like wait at breakfast joynt or deal with the crowd  tough park at lgo and i dont want anyth fanci  just good ol breakfast food

iv never had to wait at us egg and they alway deliv exact what im in the mood for whether it be oatmeal protein pancak fruit or an omelett  i went today with sarah p all the way from msp in between run errand to get readi for the oye  i had an egg white omelett with chees spinach and mushroom an english muffin and slice tomato  sarah had what us egg call the border it an open face omelett with spici chorizo onion monterey jack and cheddar chees top with salsa and sour cream  serv with warm tortilla and potato  we were both happi with our orders

servic was attent and fast  just what i was look for

when your look for a nononsens breakfast head over to us egg  they serv lunch too but i recommend go for breakfast  no matter what time of daywildflow is better than panera but still not my first choic for lunch  it on the same level as paradis bakeri  mayb a tad nicer sinc they bring your food to you at your tabl  bread is fresh and homemad soup are decent as are the sandwiches

 had the turkey and brie sandwich the sweet potato sandwich the grill veggi salad and perhap a hummus plate awhil back  

today i went with the wildflow two  my choic of two of the follow 12 sandwich 12 salad andor soup  i went with a 12 turkey brie sandwich and the split pea soup  i kind of wish that i chang the bread on the sandwich as the herb bread just didnt quit do it for me and i should have probabl ask if the split pea soup had ham in it when i order it did

il go to wildflow on someon els suggest but i will not be suggest it anytim  that how i end up there today my friend laura suggest  it fine for what it is  a fast casual chain concept with decent food and fair price around 8 for lunch on averag  

again not my first choic but im ok eat at wildflow everi now and again  there you have it

p  i hope that the construct next door to this locat is over soon  it not fun listen to pound nois over lunch with a frienda quiet lunch with our parti of three you can help but notic the tast decor interior of this restaur  take the time to ensur a nice ambianc you know your eat in a thai restaurant

 beef jerki one sun beef beef marin in special thai spice dri in one sun and deep fri 895  present quit nice with a littl salad and dip sauc the husband is usual a big fan of this  howev he thought it was onli okay here

 spici egg plant with fri tofu stir fire egg plant with thai basil leav in special sauc 995  a generous portion of eggplant and tofu i enjoy this dish especi with the basil flavor

 duck curri  boneless roast duck in spici thai curri sauc with coconut milk tomato pineappl bamboo sheet fresh chili and basil 1295  although the thai curri sauc was tasti there wasnt too much go on with the roast duck unfortun  weve had better  

they offer 10 degre of spici and we chose 7 for both the eggplant and duck dish howev it lack the spici we were expect and hope for

overal it was an averag experi at pin kaow 2  noth realli stood out that  had us want morethis was my first visit back to pin kaow in sever year and i still cant say that they are a favorit of mine the restaur is veri nice look larg clean and nice decor we came in around noon and there were two other parti seat alreadi the restaur was eerili quiet i wish there was louder music play to offset the awkward silenc my mom and i almost felt like we need to whisper it was that quiet 

we order a chicken fri rice and basil duck to share the rice was tasti but it hard to screw up fri rice the basil duck was pretti good as well the sauc was good but a littl lack in substanc the flavor are a lot more subtl than i would like overal pin kaow is just an ok dine spot in the valleybrought a client here for lunch by her request the restaur is beauti insid with tradit wood carv and thai art throughout we were seat asap at a booth and i order thai ice tea

our waitress who was thai seem not want to be there sinc she was unfriend and was just go thru the motion of servic us i went with the thai red chicken curri the entre came with a spring roll soup and steam rice the curri was actual tasti good and contain bamboo shoot and was spici creami our waitress brought the me the bill and i had to hit her up for offer of dessert which happen to be onli green tea ice cream i order a serv and it was yummi but i onli ate about half of it

if not for the mediocor servic by our waitress i would definit return here again but it would problabl be on my own to test the water again what a shame how a negat attitud can turn what should have been a abov averag experi into a below averag ratecame here for lunch the other day and have to say i was a bit dissapoint to what i expect to find
it was just 100 and they were not all that busi at all servic was veri slow but there did not seem to be a reason for that i order and a salad bar or soup come with the lunch i chose the soup that you get yourself it was not that good
but befor i did that i had gone in to the bathroom to wash my hand it was not veri clean
soup was plain and the lunch was good but the staff all sat down to have their lunch  as well which meant they were not attent to the custom there was about 5 tabl in there but whi not wait until your luch servic is over they close for lunch at 230
i just found that to be in poor tast to sit down to eatin the middl of your lunch servic while you are still wait on people
not too impress with this place ani morewhat happen lahaina

lahaina definit took a step down sinc the last time ive been here  i use to think lahaina had some of the best food with decent price  the price have sinc chang  this place use to sport a 50 all day happi hour  now it onli 10  i had their yellow tail nigiri salmon nigiri tempura shrimp roll and spici tuna hand roll  i didnt think the food was that great  both nigiri were small and the fish didnt tast as fresh as other sushi joint out here  the tempura shrimp roll was actual order on accid  i didnt realiz that this was a deep fri roll  i thought it had too much tempura which took over the tast of the actual roll  as for their hand roll this was the onli thing that was fair size but the tuna had a past type textur  tast wasnt that great either  if there was anyth good about the food it probabl just the price  even though lahaina no longer has the 50 happi hour the price for everyth is still pretti cheap one hand roll two sushi roll and four nigiri cost about 30  this is not bad at all

it the ambianc of the place that take the biggest plung  after 11 pm this place becom a 21 and over hang out  i thought everyon look and act even younger to the point that lahaina remind me of a teen club  the music is dial up so loud that i could bare hear the convers that i was have with my friend becaus of all this lahaina now attract a bunch of the young cat that were up to no good  while outsid i was even approach at least three time and ask if i was a cop  i guess i have that look but it more paranoia from this kid if you ask me  

overal i can no longer suggest this place to friend or famili  in the past this is where i ship them  now with all the other option in las vega lahaina sit at the bottom  the one thing go for lahaina is their bar and hour  other than that i think i will pass on lahainathis einstein brother is in the hyatt regenc hotel in downtown phoenix which is across from the convent center

i use to like to go to the north scottsdal einstein up there especi on the weekend 

for those of you who know noah bagel einstein is someth like that they have usual about 16 or 20 differ flavor bagel and serv sandich salad coffe and other beverag 

they make a good lox and bagel with your choic of bagel they toast it for you give you cream chees and caper red onion and slice of tomato i love this from einstein i like it on the asiago chees flavor bagel 

they also have their own ice tea blend which they call spontenai tea it onli come in one size has a refresh tea flavor mix with fruit flavor and ginger 

they can make most of the specialti coffe drink that  you find at that place with the littl brown mermaid with no bra on 

refresh the tea not the the topless mermaid that is somehow strang semierot but it is all in the mind eye not reality

servic was good and friend here toowe had a groupon for this place that we just couldnt seem to get around to use i suppos it was becaus the place was near an hour from our hous anyway i realli want to love it but here what happened

th i loved
when we couldnt get a reserv the last week of the groupon the owner offer to extend the date so we could use it they have a gorgeous patio  with live music servic was veri good portion were generous amaz mash potato and cornbread casserole

th i didnt
th price  they are steep the complex of the food now this last requir elabor i was remind of a tv show this actual sound harsher than it is that gordon ramsey doe in one episod a veri nice french restaur was have troubl and he explain to them that their dish were too complex and it hurt the flavor he suggest they simplifi which i believ they did and to good result this was my experi the dish i love were simpl and absolut delicious

but our entre were not and they suffer for it for exampl my ribey had cajun season then it had a roast veget med on top then it had melt blue chees over the season meat and vegi too mani flavor and not one wow becaus they all got lost in each other same with jim ws chicken it had panko bread and tomatillo cream sauc but it also had goat chees crumbl bacon pico de gallo and tortilla piec it sound delici but when i tri it the flavor were muddl and confus  

i hate to say it but i would have been happier elsewher im go with 35 star im go to keep an eye on their menu mayb ill give them anoth trilast night my husband i went here for dinner  we have eaten here befor and we like the food  so we thought we would tri it again   im kind of sad that our experi was not all that great this time 

the waiter that we had was not veri good  was not veri helper and he never came around to see if we like our food or if we need anyth    also the water guy was great he came around and check on us to see if we like our food or if we need anyth  i wish we could have tip him and not our waiter  
now for the food it was pretti good  we order the pineappl short rib roast and it came with mash potato and creami corn   it is definit an enough for two peopl    

last and not least the atmospher of this restaur is not all that great either  it is in the middl of this littl shop center and you could hear the music for the danc studio that was right next to the patio seat 

happi yelp everyon  if you decid to come here the food is not all that bad  we in joy itwe went on saturday night and this place was pack luckili i had made reserv beforehand the bar area is pretti cool but it and the dine area were so loud we sat on the patio which is cover and has fan and mister so we could actual hear each other talk 

we tri the date night special it includ 1 appet 2 salad 2 entre and a dessert to share for 58 the az roll were a pretti tasti appet even though i had to pick the corn out of it i enjoy my wcg bacon blue chees salad it would have been a lot better had they use spinach instead of mix green the caesar came with some nice big shave of parm yummi we both decid on the parmesan fillet for our main the parm was a littl overwhelm we both push most of it asid but the meat was veri tender my mash potato start off yummi but got pretti hard toward the end of the meal we split the white chocol browni for dessert and it was pretti good but we were so full we didnt finish 

servic was slow we were here for almost 2 hour but our waiter was veri friend everyon i know realli like this place so i think we may come back and give it anoth chancgood ol zodi when the smoke ban went into effect this bar ditch their kitchen and mount a giant sign with bold red print exclaim smoker welcom i admit the ban is probabl a good idea i will cover that statement with to each his own everyon opinion count etc etc etc but i do admir the zeal with which they stood to their caus now the decor in zodi didnt click in my gourd until veri recent whi i dont know becaus now that i get it it just so appar the place is scatter with zodiac symbol sun catcher and wind chime the light chang too depend on whos on shift if it jim or pete the light are at their fullest level but if charla is work shell turn the light complet off fill the joint with candl light and talk to you about where your sun is and which planet is in your  i cant ever follow but it sure sound nice everyon like a scapegoat when their luck has run dri yeah ive also heard sever account of the haunt who hang out at zodi which just add to the place appeal for goof like me anyway i guess he wear a white t shirt and like to play with the tvs and radio ive never wit this but i keep hoping

th drink are good n strong the price are definit afford i did howev cring a littl when i select the night life categori becaus everi time weve been to zodi the onli other peopl at the bar are other employe they do have a golden tee machin and if you take a chanc to get to know the bartend their stori can certain be entertaining

it may not be for everyon but this is one of my favorit place to go for a cocktailthis is a solid spot for decent food that wont kill your wallet and they are open until the wee hour which made my friend and i veri happi at approxim 3am on saturday we order the calamari which was super tender and delish serv with a pesto cream sauc and a littl salad the meatbal pizza was also quit tasti 

i return today to get some soup togo sinc i have a nasti cold and the servic at the bar left a lot to be desir the bartend onli care about the peopl who were eat at the bar and order drink i saw my order sit on the counter unnot by this guy for sever minut and grew more and more annoy final i ask the barback to grab the bag for me and off i went a littl piss that i had bother to tip the bartend at allwe grab lunch with a friend who live in the area 

we all grab a lunch 2 chicken tikka dwane handi season rice naan and tomato soup it was good but not the best chiken tikka was juici but the tikka sauc seem less complex than other dwane handi is good tomato soup was pretti standard naan was okay the portion arent that big but it did the trick i just was more sad about the tini dollop of rice i mean isnt that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauc and flavor of the dish by the end i was just take spoon of the dish sinc i was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesti this asian has to have rice 

795 isnt bad for a lunch but with a lot of indian place offer a buffet for 911 it isnt necessarili valu when compar but good valu for be the onli indian in the sw and few place with lunch special there

servic wasnt realli person we didnt get ani drink refil and when order drink he took mine and the bfs drink order and turn around without ask our friend if they want a drink no drink for you 

it okay if you want indian nearbi but i think a drive out is worth itthis was so close to be a 4 star review until the veri end of my time here  im give it 3 becaus the food was decent the beer select was insan and it conveni for brew and view  to see whi it not 4 star read on

i went with my husband on a friday around 330 for their happi hour to get toasti befor see a movi  a pretti conveni locat for that  when we first got in i remark how i couldnt believ there was a woman at the bar with her friend and her infant child in a stroller next to them  someth im not use to see but the place was pretti empti at that point so i disregard it  even though if i came with a babi in a stroller which i would not  i would choos to sit at one of the 50 empti tabl and not at the bar but that just me

th place was big and as i said most empti and somehow the hostess still manag to seat us in an area with no waitress  after eye a few of them as they walk by our tabl to help the tabl around us one final came over to us  is anyon help you  i can go figur out who is suppos to be your waitress  no you are go to take our order

lik i said the food honest was pretti good  we had the chicken lettuc wrap which had a ton of pine nut yum and came with three delici dip sauc  hoisin peanut satay and a sweet and spici  we also had the chicken nacho and onion ring which were averag  the onion ring were serv with your choic of dip sauc ranch or slight pink ranch  i like to call it ranch rose  i would high suggest they develop a horseradish dip sauc  

overwhelm by the beer select my husband ask for a recommend say he usual goe for the lager pale ale and amber ale and the waitress had no clue what he should get onli that i rememb someon order one of the pale ale earlier and didnt like it  ok  i order a rum and coke see as well drink were suppos to be 4 for the happi hour special  we got out beverag and i tast my drink and thought the bartend screw up and put stoli vanilla in it  my husband tast it and agre  oh well im not one to complain  when order our second round i specif emphas anoth rum and coke  this time a bus boy brought our drink to us and hand me the glass and said your captain and coke  here a lesson to all the waitress out there  when your special is 4 well drink and your clientel doesnt specifi the brand of alcohol they want that mean well liquor  dont substitut it with top shelf liquor if you can call captain that and definit dont substitut regular rum with spice rum  captain and coke is a veri specif drink  rum and coke is not  

it turn from bad to wors when the kid in the booth behind us decid to toss his straw over and it hit me in the head  i turn and scour at the tabl of parent and they shrug it off and point to the kid as if to say oh it wasnt our fault he was just a kid  for all the parent read this if your children cant behav and you cant control them dont bring them to happi hour  it is not okay to shrug off bad behavior like that  if it were my child i would demand he apolog to whomev he hit

when we got the bill i was glad to see that i was charg the full price for my rum and coke  stellar exact whi i came to happi hour  as we left the place had fill in pretti well and i saw anoth stroller with a babi in it onli this time the parent were just stand around not even in seat or at the bar they also had a toddler who was sit on the floor of the bar area  im sorri im just appal  ive never seen babi saddl up to a bar befor   what if someon accident walk by and spill beer on your babi  a bar is not a place for children i dont care how bad you need a drink and it happi houreveri time i come to phoenix i like to tri a new upscal restaur  this time tarbel look realli appeal i wasnt over impress but i did get a decent meal 

first of all the park situat here is terribl the strip mall it in has anoth restaur and a bar so save some time and saniti opt for the valet

th hostess was nice we had reserv but still had to wait a bit for our tabl this place was busi and loud a lot louder than i would have expect the tabl were way too close togeth if you were lucki enough to get one of the stand alon tabl it might be ok but we were sit along the wall and it was way too cramp 

we had a coupl of appet both good the capres salad tast good but was not remark the calamari was cook perfect and came with two realli nice dip sauc 

we end up get the appet befor we even order dinner so we had to hang on to our unwieldi menus while tri to eat our appet sinc there was no room to place them on the table

dinn was good not great 2 in our group got the pepper steak steak au poivr it was tasti the cream spinach was more of a sauté than cream i had the doubl cut pork chop this was realli good it came with a coupl of pierogi fill with bacon and cabbag the last person in the group got the special which was a ny strip roast she ask for it medium rare was told it might be closer to medium to which she repli noth well done wouldnt you know it that piec of meat had no pink what so ever she sent it back and we share sinc we didnt want to wait for an entre to be cook 

desert was creme brule and chocol mouss the creme brule was huge and the sugar crust was perfect the chocol mouss was good but serv in a wine glass so it was a pain to eat im all for present but function need to be there too

aft see this guy on iron chef i was expect a epic meal i would talk about for year to come i guess i shouldnt have gotten my expect updont want to cook kid have a last minut sleep over impromptu game night treat friend who help your inlaw movethes are all the reason we order from rosatis
i would rather order rosati over domino or pizza hut or papa johns
let start with the way they cut their pizzainto small squaresbrilli i dont alway want to eat a whole slice and their portion make it easi not to gorge
i love the thin crispi crust that stay dri  crunchi their top are generous and overal good deliveri pizza enough ratio of chees to top to crust
if you save your pizza box stub you get a discount off your next order be sure to ask about their special when you calllove some of their flavor here coffe roch if your familiar w ferrero rocher chocol then you know what this select will tast like peanut butter and now cheesecak  my latest purchas was a combo of coffe and cheesecak a musttry

 tri some of the sorbet here a long time ago and like them but sinc it been awhil ill have to make it a point to tri them again to make a formal review  with the weather heat up veri fast this task wont be veri hard to do   the entranc to the park garag is on the southwest corner of washington pay attent peopl this is import yeah i know  it look like it on 3rd street but it not that a servic entranc the actual entranc is the one that look like an exit but it not just an exit  it the entranc my first pass i drove right by it think it was the exit and the entranc must have been on 3rd street and had to go around the block but it was 5 oclock and there was a sun game fuck the sun took me 20 minut to go around the fuck block so my second pass i turn left on 3rd street and 3rd street a oneway go south so i couldnt just turn around anoth 20 minut around the block third pass i was so piss it was my third pass i wasnt pay attent and thought 3rd street was 4th street and drove right by it again fuck shit man whi is there no 4th street what the fuck happen to 4th street jesus christ who built this fuck citi burn them find them and fuck burn them are you pay attent pay attent peopl this is import i dont want this to happen to you i care about you well most of you some of you anyway whatev the entranc to the park garag is on the southwest corner of washington

th food okay littl prici cool present ill upload a pic of our app later when ive had some time to cool off make sure you go with someon you that make you smile that what made it for me sorri for all the fuckit pain me to write this review but not as much as the guilt i feel for subject my friend to the disast that occur on friday night what i thought would be a fun sushi night turn out to be a nightmar i left befor wit said nightmar but from hear what realli happen my review would be much lower if i had been there if i had known what i know now about the servic particular one waiter i would have pick one of the mani other sushi joint in the area 

anyway the sushi was pretti good highlight of the ayc were the veri crunchi calamari w two choic of dip sauc the hamachi kama and the sear tuna nigiri portion are big especi the roll some of the seafood could have been fresher like the uni but overal the sushi was satisfactori the food alon deserv 3 star 

what doesnt deserv 3 star is the servic at first the servic was good our server was nice at this point my review was sit pretti at 3 star but as the night progress i could tell our server was get frustrat due to the order and the amount of peopl at the restaur larg parti are alway difficult i understand that howev if everyon in the tabl is order ayc it shouldnt be difficult to split the bill have to leav earli i need to pay earli after ask our server multipl time if i could pay earli he final agre after say no initi and took my card howev when i got the bill i immedi knew someth wasnt right i was overcharg by 3 or so but i was in a hurri so i just paid and left it at that servic deserv 2 star 

mayb the server was have an off night but i made reserv in advanc for our larg parti so they shouldv been more prepar im kind of reliev i miss the fiasco that occur after i left becaus if i had stay i definit would have live up to the sushi wa name and cri wa wa

for small parti sushi wa is aok but larg parti beware

happi 1st birthday dppm  

stop by this afternoon to help celebr dppms 1st birthday by sampl and vote for the best birthday cake in the birthday cake bakeoff which was held from 4p6p  i left befor 6p so perhap the celebr continu after 6p  while i was there i tri cupcak by cake contessa and slice of cake by tracey dempsey phoenix public market cafe and bread basket  it was so hard to pick a favorit as each had someth more special than the other  honest  here are particip offer well at least what i was abl to try

cak contessa vanilla and chocol cupcak w vanilla frosting
both cupcak were meltinyourmouth tender  out of the two my fave was the vanilla

traci dempsey coffeemarmalad cake 
white cake w orang marmaladevanilla ice layer in the middl and coffe frost  love the textur of this cake which was more like a pound cake and i also like the orang and coffe combo

phoenix public market cafe chocol cake and vegan chocol cake
yellow cake w chocol frost on top and middl layer as well as a dark chocol ganach atop a vanilla fondant layer  love this cake textur which was a littl denser than that of traci and the combo of the it textur and fondantganach was new to me  ive had cake w a fondant top and ive had cake frost w ganach but not one w both  out of all the cake i sampl ccs simpl vanilla cupcak and ppmcs ganachetop yellow cake top my list until someon brought out the

vegan chocol cake eggless chocol cake w raspberri jam doubl as a fill and as a topper w garnish of strawberri  the bottom had a tancolor layer which i assum would tast like mocha but i didnt detect ani coffe note  at first glanc i thought it might have been flourless but closer inspect reveal a cakey textur  this cake was serv slight warm and tast veri good  dppm deserv my vote for best birthday cake by offer both vegan and nonvegan cake imo

bread basket white cake cherri and vanilla fill and frosting
lik the flavor combo and the cake textur but i was felt like the flavor couldv been a littl more potent summer fruit barn in phoenix sell bread and pastri from bread basket

i also sampl sweet republ pumpkin spice ice cream a season item  it was fabul  i must stop by and tast it again befor it leav the menu  crave ice cream and grate spoon gelato were noshow  boo

thank you dppm for the invite

p  forgiv the sorrylook cupcak they fell as i reach for anoth slice of cake  there were so mani other who were reach for plate from all direct  what  whi was i such a pig you ask  hey i had to tri everi slice if im to vote for the best birthday cake yes  ok then  

hmm i wonder which cake end up w the honori type japanes and my zip code in to yelp and came up with korean  so off i went

i am pretti sure there are sever menu option  i had a lunch menu which had none of the grill option on it and i think there is yet anoth menu for the sushi bar  direct behind me i could hear a grill be use and saw a coupl of cart of food go past me to the tabl  would have been nice to see how all the food was use but i probabl would have watch close enough to intrud on their meal

i order a slice beef lunch box 895 and an ice tea 125  first up was a cloudi bowl of soup with green onion in it pretti tasti  after a while lunch arriv in a compart  tray  front and center was the beef sever grist piec  off to the near left were some pickl veggi and in the far left were i think 3 slice of california roll a piec of appl some sort of deep fri thingi and some ginger  in the far right was sticki rice and in the veri center was some wasabi  and in the near right was i think a coupl of differ kind of bean sprout some sort of green leafi veggi and some sort of cake thing  even though i couldnt identifi most of it i ate it all  obvious it didnt tast bad or i would have ignor some of it

th servic was ok but not friend like it was with the regular  i would have like to ask some question about what was on my plate but got the big box store lack of eye contact with everi employe that walk past  odd when they brought my entre they did not take away my empti soup bowl  i notic they did that at all of the tabl onli buse once

it look like the back section of the dine room could be partial close off for a group

it was an ok experi  i think i would rather go with somebodi who knew the food betteroff the freeway and near the theater is havana grill a cubanstyl restaur that offer free salsa lesson on sunday and live music on friday and saturday nights

th bf and i went there for dinner last night and i think it fair to say this was my first cuban experi  

of all the cubanstyl milkshak 495 to tri the guanabana was recommend and it was a fabul choic  it was sweet not over milki and a nice finish to my dinner  the bf tri their version of the  caipirinha cachaca a brazilian rum simpl syrup and lime 795  

some butter pressgril bread was place befor us in a basket as we perus the menu  for our aperitivo appet we tri their mini sandwich cubano 695  it a smaller version of their cuban sandwich and it made with tender roast pull pork slice ham chees dill pickl and mustard on cuban bread  it then pressgril and serv with mariquita fri thin green plaintain or french fri  it also come with a garlic lime dip sauc  dont be foolish and get french fri now go for the plaintain for sure  

thus far our experi at havana grill was garnish a 4 star and i was excit about our entre  

the bf had their bolich mechado 1495 which is slowcook roast eye of the beef round stuf with chorizo spanish sausag  it serv with white rice black or red bean or moro  he had them with moro  the dish was lukewarm and lack flavor  if anyth it had an odd plastic wrap aftertast that didnt fare well  same with the moro  the bf end up dous the whole thing with hot sauc  i should mention that the waiter comment that this was his favorit dish so i can onli imagin his horror when we cover the whole thing with hot sauce

i tri their version of the lechon asado 1495 which is leg of pork that is slowli ovenroast and marin in a mix of lemon garlic lime orang juic and spice  there are also onion that are mix into this dish  i had this with white rice and red bean  although my pork was also lukewarm it was tender and not dri at all  it had a lot more flavor that the other dish although my red bean need some kick as well

overal we were more impress with our cuban sandwich than our entre  servic was okay  the waiter did come by often to ask how our meal was but we did have to request that our water glass be refil  although they didnt advertis that there was live music on a wednesday night appar there was a group practic that even  it might be too loud to carri on a regular convers when music is be play  but then again we figur we might come back to tri out their free salsa lesson and grab some other apertivo instead of do dinner  salsa anyone

sidenot the las vega week offer a bogo free entre coupon up to 1500i final did it for toni t  i walk to yoshinoya and got a beef bowl gyudon to go  for whatev reason the fade buildingsign alway turn me off so i expect it to be old and dirti insid  i alreadi can get cheap gyudon from japan creek or just make it at home so i never saw a reason to come here though i work within walk distanc for almost 6 years

i spot yoshinoya in japan but never sought it out to eat at one  the other day i watch a show call fast food gone global on travel channel which usual chronicl us chain that infiltr other countri and make special menus for each countri tast  howev this episod was intern fast food compani infiltr into the us and whether or not menu item were chang for the american palate

yoshinoya has clear adjust it menu to the american palat but the gyudon is still what gyudon is alway  fatti thin slice beef cook with onion in a sauc made with typic japanes ingredi and serv on top of rice with beni shoga red pickl ginger as an accompani i order a regular beef bowl just under 6 with tax and ad beni shoga  i also sprinkl on some shichimi togarashi and though not tradit some chop green onion that was out for miso soup order onli becaus green onion are my favorit vegetable

th menu otherwis has some odd thing i am not a fan of teriyaki type joint so i do not like the weird veget like zucchini in my bowl or stir fri like veget udon bowl chicken and combo bowl and grill fish  i ask what type of fish and the ladi pronounc someth weird twice to me that start with an s a name of a fish i certain have never heard of in my life and have no idea how to spelli did notic yoshinoya now has ponzu sauc not for the beef bowl but rather the fish  i like the to go bowl packag and the meal stay hot on my jaunt back to the offic to eat  i was pleasant surpris by the cleanli of the interior too  accept credit card for order over 5i come across this hotel mani time when i drive by here and i see the food special on the huge sign

thi is my final meal in las vega befor head back to the airport so i decid to return to the terribl casino for their 999 special ie full rack of babi back pork rib  

the special is at this 24hour diner call the bougainvillea cafe locat in the mezzani level one floor abov the casinolevel there are a ton of other special too but my target was definit for the babi back rib special for 999 i get a full rack of rib drench in bbq sauc a corn on a cob a side of mash potato and a toast sourdough bread it not cattlemen claim jumper or ani of the finer steakhous version but it decent for the price the rack end has some dri and burnt piec and the middl has some moist and juici meat the mash potato were ok but the corn on the cob has no comment from me i didnt eat it

babi back rib httpwwwyelpcombizphotoszwo2a6qpiucssjurj02hwselectyftx7rs2xoiajziimauyq

mash potato httpwwwyelpcombizphotoszwo2a6qpiucssjurj02hwselectncrzy20hwy2l4zmi6enuw

mi meal was ok for the price but if you want cheap eat come here i may give this diner a second chanc and tri someth elscrave korean and not want to go near the tofu hut per my last visit httpwwwyelpcombiz0w3bdeoxvwktpypwbn5kiq it was a toss up between djk korean bbq or mr tofu  after check out their small and simpl menu at mr tofu we decid we like the full korean experi that djk was offering

with no wait on the past memori holiday for dinner we were seat at  a booth right smack in the middl  after perus their extens menu we opt for their dwaeji galbi grill pork rib at 2295 the bfs favorit of bulgogi dolsot bibimbap steam rice with veget and beef to mix in the hot stone pot at 1495 and the mul naengmyeon buckwheat noodl with veget and meat in chill broth at 895 base on their picture

about nine differ banchan was brought to us after our order went in  it includ cabbag kim chee bean sprout salad marin octopus with pickl cucumb daikon omelet raw garlic slice jalapeno broccoli and some kind of dip past  the salad had a nice dress to it and was pretti good  the octopus was pretti yummi as well

w soon discov they are out of dwaeji galbi and order the sanggalbi premium beef short rib at 2695 instead  the beef was good it wasnt fabul for the price we paid  the bulgogi dolsot bibimbap was averag  at first the rice seem a bit mushi  but the stone pot that it came it realli crisp up the rice veri well  appar this was the best the bf has ever had in term of crispi  the mul naengmyeon didnt quit look like the pictur it was present in  it came with two slice of beef one hard boil egg some veggi and few pine nut  we ask the waitress about it befor order and she was honest in her opinion note that although she enjoy it it a bit differ for other peopl  it a cold noodl soup dish and i found it refresh on a hot day  they also give you vinegar and horseradishi mustard to mix it up with and this give the broth the much need quick  

back in the citi im use to get tea automat  but i guess here you have to ask for it  at least they dont charg for it though

i like how the tabl are set up here  at other korean restaur they have to bring this contain of hot coal to your tabl and it pretti danger  but here they just turn it on with their gas stove  and if you arent go to cook the meat yourself they simpli put the cover on and it flat like the rest of your tabl  

the bf was still eat when the cashier girl brought our check to the tabl  she didnt even bother ask if we want dessert  they offer creme brule ice cream etc  ask if they had ani shikhy and learn they did not we were a bit disappoint  had to visit the asian supermarket next door to get some

servic  we had the longhair waitress  there this one shorthair waitress that was not so friend  when she initi ask us if we were readi to order and we ask for anoth minut she made a huff sound  the bf and i look at each other like wtf  thank good the smiley longhair waitress end up serv us the rest of the even and she made up for the bad custom servic of the other one

sid note the restroom have these gigant squar sink  watch out for the first stall in the ladi room cuz there a huge puddl right in front and i think they might have a leakag problem per the previous yelper who mention the mess too  

revers happi hour is 11 pm to 7 am with local id onli and that mean 20 off
you can find pic of our dinner in the busi profil above

i think they are relat to ginseng bbq on las vega boulevard  

total bill with tax and tip 6550
total star 35i like this place but it not in my favorit of restaur to go shuseki serv japanes dish known for it ramen bowl and a assort of other food that includ sushi and seafood in general although it is a japanes restaur it own by a chines man rais in japan i believ who speak mandarin
shuseki is hard ever a busi place so it actual an ideal spot to chill out where it quiet everi time i have been to shuseki there is at most 24 other tabl otherwis what keep this place afloat is the regular who come here and elder group of japanes men who frequent at night
servic is averag here is kind of slow the server could do a better job of circul around the tabl and pay attent more your better off pay at the counter than ask for your bill howev they are polit and inform if you have question about the menu
to make up for the slow server at least the food come out in a good amount of time
fish here can be a hit or miss so be weari when you order sushi or sashimi of ani kind best time to get the fresh fish from them is actual dure lunch time
th ramen they offer here is actual decent but it sometim a hit and miss again with the ramen
overal i like the calm atmospher and afford price here
thi might not be an ideal place for you if your expect a lotwhat a novel idea a peanut buttereveryth store gourmet peanut butter to buy peanut butter base sandwich peanut butter smoothi peanutt butter snack i think you get the point this is a no brainer if you love peanut butter your gonna love this place if you can think of a way to eat peanut butter theyv probabl got you cover 

we tri the smore peanut butter sandwich which had chocol pb graham cracker and marshmallow on a grill paninityp bread the sandwhich was good even though a bit rich but i guess that what you get when you order a smore sandwhich so i cant complain next we got a pb smoothi and it was just odd it was frothi and tast like celeri you know how when you were a kid and your mom would trick you into eat celeri by slather some pb on it well the first sip of this smoothi instant was reminisc of that tast i dont know what was go on mayb they didnt clean the blender good enough or someth but the celeri flavor smoothi just isnt someth that did it for us yuck 

there realli not much els to say about this place peanut butter till you cant take it anymor that about all it in scottsdal fashion squar so next time your wander around amongst the rich scotdelian humbl yourself and grab a peanut butter sandwhich just for fun it not gonna blow your sock off but it isnt bad either 3255my friend and i stay at the mont carlo and had to wake up earli the next day for a convent so we decid to check out the pub which was downstair it a pretti larg establish and you realli do feel like your in a pub 

the clientel is veri mix but it normal attract a bit of an older crowd 30 rather than the younger clientel under 30 no need to dress up for this joint just come casual and have some beer they have an array of beer for you to tri 

tri and come on a friday or saturday night around the late hour of 10pm they have a live band zowi bowi they are pretti good actual they are also veri veri energet which i love the girl singer is like an older britney spear and the guy is like rod stewart but who act and dress younger it pretti darn cool they sing a lot of the popular song and get the crowd dancing

if you come earlier like around 8 or 9pm then you will suffer with some folk countri music so come later when the place is poppn
relax drink and have fun with friend at a chill placeshort review alert

dur the vega trip the guy want to hit up a bar  be a vega veteran know that there realli isnt ani stand along bar avail so decid to check it out  most of the bar in vega are infus into the casino as a barloung style next to the slot  the pub got a cool logo of a whale with fire come out of it blowhol so i guess that was the draw of my attent  i enjoy these littl things

onc we were here we notic that it was more of a restaur than an actual bar  the place was wide open with decent decor dim light and dark furnitur around the facil  sinc we were look for a bar and my friend were more disappoint becaus it wasnt an actual bar and actual wasnt crowd at all so we decid just to have quick bite to eat instead

ord chicken quesadilla with mango sauc calamari with 2 sauc and nachosquesadilla was great i mean how can you go wrong with tortilla chicken chees and sweeten sauc  an easi and safe choic  calamari was fri to perfect with decent sauc accompani with the dish  nacho were humong in portion but it was over salti and the chees look fake so the nacho wasnt a hit at all

w didnt get ani drink as we were realli look forward to a bar so after the meal immedi we left the pub so that we can get some drink in our system  the entir meal appet cost us almost 40 so it not a cheap meal by ani mean but i guess you are pay just like the whale with the fire out of the blowholei that whi he is burn inside

i may or may not come back to this place some entertain was happen on stage but it wasnt realli grab anyon attent so perhap mont carlo have to rethink their strategi by have this place within their facil  it just anoth anoth midhigh price restaur with mediocr food

now you see whi this is such a short reviewlocal get happi hour 24hour a day  1 slider 1 wing and 12 off miller  coor beer i think  the best deal out of all of those are the 1 slider but theyr just your basic mini burgers

th pub has an extens beer menu both a mix of draft and bottl select  they also carri uniqu season bottl all over 15 per bottl from what i rememb  i need to come back here on a sunday sinc they advertis 12 off all beer not sure if that just for local or for everybodi  if you area a las vega local in the mont carlo look for cheap nourish this may be your best beti came here for lunch after drive by this place a few time and was happi with what i had

th decor here is realli cute  simpl clean and bright  i went with the greek chicken pita and it came with a bag of chip a side of pasta salad and a pop   total bill was 902  not bad  the chicken was tasti pasta salad was okay at best  i took home my extra and had them as a light dinner 

food here is fresh healthi and light  serv are healthi in size and would glad return in the futurtime for an update

i mustv been in a generous mood when i wrote my origin pugzi review  ive been back a coupl of time and im still a fan  it aok or worthi of 3 star in yelp terms

al 3 of those star are for the food the ambianc bathroom servic etc are just eh

thi is not a gourmet eateri it more the place you would go to when in a hurri or just need some nourish of sort and dont care much about atmospher  im sure ill be back but it for sure not make my top ten favorit lunch place list anytim soon  but kudo to pugzi for their histori theyv been in busi sinc 1981  and as i said ill for sure return on occas  it just wont be a regular in my lunchtim rotat3 starsfood  blah the salad was the highlight and food went down from there red sauc tast like ragu my carbonara was a greasi bland wateri sauc mess if i hadnt had a glass of wine in me i would have not eaten more than one bite  i think i manag about 6 or sough just think about it

1 starservicesuck  i joke that the femal waitress must also be the cook becaus she seem to vanish for veri long period  the male waiter came buy just a bit more than never  

5 starsatmospher and sinatra type piano guyhov a bit too much i think he would be much better sit at the piano and sing  we had fun with hostbounc guy  

i realli want to love this place  the insid is so dark and vega  it would be perfect with the piano singer and drinksbut for foodfa get about ditas a certifi carb addict bagel are top in my book in need of a quick lunch option this place is good for the most part food was standard but like most restaur in the unlv area they get pack and are slow as molass as far as servici give it a 3 12 stars

mi pilipino peep say nanay gloria is great  hoi nakong you will bee pull  da beepstek is delici i was told by an older patron which i think thought i was one of her relat  oh well we do what we do  be respect and tell nanay salamat

w usual get here for lunch and there often a crowd  it can get busi between late breakfast and earli lunch  seat is pretti limit but at least there is a dine area on the opposit side of the buffet line  but be awar when you go to nanay gloria the room are warm  even with the ac on i was still sweatin a bit  i dont know if they are just tri to save money by keep the thermostat at the 80s or folk work there want to feel like they are back home in the islandshot and humid  bring a fan to cool yourself down just in case

that how i felt when i left az wine 

wow

that what i thought when i entered

so what happen onc insid allow me to explain 

it was near 20 minut brows the aisl befor somebodi pop their head over and said you find everyth miss my repli yes the difficulti is decid what to get perfect opportun to strike me up for a convo no perhap tri and sell me the more expens suggest no well he simpli said okay then he disappear grant he was set up for a privat affair at the bar area that start in about 45 minut but still was there nobodi els around oh well  i realli did want some assist after all it was my 1st time here and there were so so so mani chioces

so i perus the aisl i want to find my fave brand and wine style to see how much they charg here that when i saw some inconsist exampl row eleven pinot noir show up in 4 differ place with 4 differ price tag i look close same bottl strang this happen more than onc so i was of cours befuddl 

i did like how they organ the aisl even have a pinot noir section devot to california and oregon wine they also had a red blend aisl and and aisl devot to eclect white includ blend white you may never heard of or those you consid new favorit  like viogner 

so two thumb up for how they organ their rows

i found a bottl of wine i want but it had no price tag not even on the shelf instead of bother the oneandon guy work i just opt not to get it sad huh 

in compar price i think they are reason to most wine store and less expens than your upscal market like aj and safeway you can get an oregon red here for 17 that would cost you 25 elsewher yet dont be fool they do have some realli pricey wine  even some top 100 

they sell halfbottl but if you look at the price you may decid it just better to splurg for the entir bottl 

plus they sell wine accessori even gift bag and stopper i like that though i didnt need anyth except wine 

i left there with 3 bottl of wine for under 50 not bad especi consid i tend to buy wine i like that averag 2030 per bottl 

if onli the servic and price consist had been better 

yet sinc this place is conveni and easytofind i will most like be back im sort of a diy winechoos anyhow plus i found a coupl wine ive onli had onc that i would love love love to sip and enjoy again  includ a gagliardo 

side note the bar area look cool i love the idea of have a wine tast in the actual wine store i overheard the guy work say that if anyon like the wine they had them instock to sell and that they would offer discount depend on how mani bottl you decid to snatch up 

in the end though my wow turn to a simpl meh i think it all boil down to not be acknowledg when i came in and not be engag in even a short convers cmon i think wine store should make the extra effort to talk to custom sinc mani custom want to explor their option and learn a thing or two while they brows exampl oh realli this is what i should serv with my seafood fondu awesom 

plus it make me 500 more like to buy more than one bottl when im there and 500 more like to make that store my firstchoic store for my wine needs

meh their lossim not a fan of buffet tray of food be tamper with freak me out i havent been to a buffet in age  at least not the last 3 time weve been to vega but this time i had a crave for peel and eat shrimp i dont eat much els at a buffet so i said let go to the orlean for their buffet sinc it realli cheap and i know they have peel and eat shrimp

ok so the price was super cheap  it 749 for lunch  and it includ nonalcohol beverag there were the usual bbq stuff mexican stuff chines stuff italian stuff and an attempt at mongolian bbq which was rather dismal 

i had about a pound and of a half of shrimp a few sliver of bacon 3 corn on the cob a swirl of vanilla ice cream with crush peanut 3 glass of ice tea and i was done i rememb last time they had these fantast cooki but there wasnt a cooki in sight on top of that they have ad a gelato station but all the dessert were hand out you couldnt help yourself to them

for me this buffet suffic becaus i dont realli eat much at a buffet usual ill eat peel and eat shrimp smoke salmon or trout and lamb chop if they have them what the point of pay 20 buck when that all i eat 

the buffet at the orlean is fine by me it has the shrimp and im happi to pay 750 for it i must say i rememb there to be more select so i have to deduct a star for this visit howev i didnt feel rip off and i was content when i stood up to leave

p if you are my kind of buffet eater  check out my review of the buffet at palac station  i thought it was better than this one and for almost the same priceive been come to los favorito for year now  while there definit better mexican restaur around the valley los favorito is my favorit place for mexican in the east valley

with los favorito be so close to chandler high it alway loud and crazi insid  the atmospher is noth to marvel over but servic is alway great and the food is decent and nice portion  

i alway get the california carn asada burrito combo with a horchata as my beverag of choic  the bean and the rice is pretti standard fare but the burrito is money  that warm tortilla the nice season carn asada the melti chees and those potato heaven  it especi heaven after a night of guzzl booz i still come here sober mind you  while they offer the basic red and green salsa it not exact spici enough for my tast but i dont mind too much  fair warn for those muchcalientelovit was certain about time that madison got a trader joe and it has becom a stapl of my groceri shop  i can onli give it three star though becaus it onli possibl to go there for onli veri specif reason  my biggest complaint 

everi piec of produc is wrap in plastic  thank you veri much but i am perfect capabl of cut my own broccoli  and i actual dont mind if my asparagus is expos to the air it doesnt need to be in packag  and dont worri about it if i want a green pepper red pepper and yellow pepper i can find all three separ they dont need to be wrap togeth 

other than that i have just realiz that you cant go to trader joe with your usual shop list you have to go there with a specif trader joe shop list  they have some great simmer sauc and frozen dinner item mmmmgorgonzola gnocci but if you want stapl cereal cracker or box item youll probabl have to make a separ trip to a differ place 

but that what trader joe is for i guess  stock up on the cheap but delici charl shaw wine and grab a few thing to compliment your cheaper and more environmentallyfriend shop at other store and you will be contentshop here make me long for my trader joe back in tucson at river and campbel there are four in tucson and onli one had killer produc i dont have anoth choic here and so i go too often though im met with wilt green and bean that have seen better day it not a past it prime sort of thing it a the produc just isnt as good as id like sort of thing i dig the layout there is an abund of staff but if im be complet honest nobodi say hello ask if you need help find anyth or is quick to make a tasti suggest the reason i dont mind spend 5 on a bag of salad ill still go becaus there are thing i cant get anywher els love the laundri deterg and price of organ tater but itll never be a place i do all my shop unless the green get bettermario batali youv disappoint me again first with osteria mozza now with bb im realli becom a skeptic 

ye it nice and all but it also loud like osteria mozza you play weird music i mean realli i love zeppelin and i realli love modest mous but when im pay as much as i am for a meal with good compani i want to be abl to listen to my dinner companion not your rockin ipod 

i start with a simpl albeit expens salad and had the sweet potato ravioli which in all honesti tast like butternut squash ravioli but whatev it was good it wasnt blow my mind good but it was good im disappoint again by the complet disregard for vegetarian more option here than at osteria mozza but still veri veri lack still no vegetarian main cours so i alway feel cheap when not order one and then silli when i have to watch other peopl eat their main cours when i dont have one

our server was goofi and made inappropri joke which  hmm i would expect some profession i make inappropri joke too  but not to my client 

just ookaaayyy and it shouldnt be just oookaaayyy it should be great and it just isnt35 star i think

went in to have a small bite and of cours a bottl of wine so we sat at the bar  bartend was friend as was the neighbor to my left  it was a great start to our trip

start with the amus bouh chickpea bruschetta it was ok noth to write home about although here i am writing

w with the waiter recommend of the grill octopus and im so glad we did  the best octopus ever is still at osteria mozza anoth batali establish but it was super yummi here
beef cheek ravioli with a duck liver sauc it was a bit heavi but tasti  

overal i wouldnt rush out to this place but i would total grab some pasta and octopus  friend servic and best of all after about 9pm or so the staff turn up the volum on batali ipod and we get to rock out if servic was speedier these guy would be rock solid in my book lunch special are a steal at 699 and the expand menu offer more option than befor but it sloooooooooooooooow and dure the lunch hour i dont alway have time to wait around delish in the end just slow go lead up to itinsid the fremont casino downtown this casino snack bar serv up chines fast food  fresh made hot sandwich 

hot dogfri  drink 295 2 item chines combo 599 french dip  waffl fri plus a drink 699 

french dip was supris good waffl fri were fresh  crisp chines was not so good 

definit a good spot to know of if your downtown drink  on a budget or crave some chines35 stars

oystersfreak raw oyster who wouldnt like raw oyster with my ladi and those with liver diseas as the onli except oyster that are arrang immacul in their half shell by the dozen on a clean plate display their lusciousnakedselv in prepar for your partak sinc my caveman day in vega i have frequent this spot to get a littl extra oyster fix due to the fresh and qualiti as well as varieti offer here not to mention it was cheap enough to overindulge

but time alway seem to dull the glimmer of ani establish in vega at the veri least you will alway eventu begin to notic some form of gradual declin like the dent and scratch that appear on a oncenew car this oyster bar is no differ if i was to review a few year ago harrah oyster bar would have receiv a rave 5star review now it sit mere on a 35star bar stool instead of a throne and has lost it luster like i would say of spot at olvega pack but have an absenc of a long queue

th oyster are still okay but for some bloodi unknown reason the shuck has becom a lot clumsier in the last year as i find more bit of shell in the oyster as i down each half shell this just ruin the overal oyster consum experi for me perhap theyr have a bad day or the oyster decid to go on strike togeth with the oyster union and extend their crap to the taxpayers

th cioppino and the bouillabaiss which act as my main cours after down all those oyster have also lost it mindblow flavor i can onli pout now and visit this establish more as a continu habit than as a person food preference

servic still remain close to stellar and i have alway been treat like royalty

lesighif you like msg come to the noodl shop in mandalay bay to get your 15 a pop wonton soup  

while the servic was impecc and the waiter and waitress were run around with their cute littl chines restaur accent i am almost certain peopl do not talk like this normal  the chines accent for restaur is total romantic  ie i know plenti of chines peopl with terribl accent and enunci on all the wrong harsh syllables

anyway i cant believ we paid almost 30 for 2 bowl of msg noodl  it straight robberi i tell you  id probabl do it again if i was stuck in mandalay bay and hungovtake out review
i hate to go against the grain but i realli enjoy the noodl shop my husband and i were in need for some comfort food and for us that noodl we order pad thai and hong kong style pan fri noodl and seafood to go the staff was help and kind they kept it short and sweet so that we could be on our way we had to go take care of some busi with the concierg and when we got back our order was wait for us 
we took it up to the room and enjoy our noodl and tv as god intend the pad thai was fantast and i am fulli awar that it could be becaus i was starv but either way i enjoy it veri much mr r finish his dish and even had some of mine i appreci the noodl shop for be differ from the other casual fare offer at mandalay bay sometim you have to take less than desir noodl in order to get noodl at allwhen your at a hotel your choic for ani type of food are usual limit at mandalay bay this chines restaur doesnt disappointuntil you see the bill

th beef chow fun was great and the won ton noodl were exact what youd expect from a chines place the menu is fair larg with plenti to choos from the food is tasti without the msg overload of most asian place 

overal the qualiti seem fresh and the servic is thank prompt and friend everyth is on the pricier side so be prepar or head to one of the mani chines restaur along spring mountain roadcrave pho but not want to drive down to spring mountain i final gave bamboo bistro a tri  this place has come high rate by quit a few peopl and i was pretti excit  

 pho beef combin of slice of rare beef cook brisket  beef ball medium 650  the first thing i notic when the bowl was place in front of me was how small it was  the bowl was of averag size but it was the portion insid the bowl that look a bit disappoint  i look at the husband and he was think the same thing  when i start to stir the noodl around they were stuck togeth in one big clump  not good  and it also took a bit longer for an order of pho to come out and i have a feel my noodl were sit in the bowl too long befor it was brought out to me  the broth smell great but tast averag  there wasnt that much meat in my order either  sure it a medium and they have the larg and xlarg famili size avail but im usual pretti content with the smallest size offer at vietnames restaurants

 grill chicken marin then grill 850  the husband couldnt decid between the chicken with basil sauc or the lemongrass chicken  the golden bake chicken was unavail this even  the tabl next door got the grill chicken and the waiter owner suggest that was a better choic over the three  it came with a side salad rice and a dip sauc  the husband said it tast like he expect it too and appreci that it wasnt dry

overal i was a bit disappoint with my first experi with bamboo bistro  pho isnt what they are known for so that was my mistak in order it  next time ill have to tri their beef carpaccio hous special or the 7 cours of beef

with what look like a husband and wife team run the floor they were effici and friend  most famili were dine there on a wednesday night so im sure theyd get higher star onc i tri their other offerhungov and drive back to la after a long weekend of parti we hit up mr tofu for some grub

servic was extrem slow sinc there was one waiter he seem to favor the korean patron and serv them first whatever

i just want my noodl soup i had the anchovi handmad noodl soup and it was ginorm noodl were handmad for sure but where the hell were the anchovi i didnt see ani and it sure didnt look like the photo they post on the wall 

the noodl were decent but kinda bland oh well it hit the spot and got rid of the edgi 

mi friend had the seafood tofu and she like it alot 

total for two peopl was 20 not bad 

but probabl wont be come back here ill hit up the pho place next door over this 

pix httppandaliciousformeblogspotcomthis place is ok

whil tour planet hollywood an overwhelm sensat for a nice refresh lemon drop came upon me so not realli know where to satisfi my crave we just happen to walk by this place and decid to check them out

th place interior wise is noth realli special just your typic sport bar

our bartend was extrem nice and went well out of his way to make some decent lemon drop especi consid the fact that it a sport bar where lemon drop are not usual a specialti of theres

overal the drink were ok the bartend was extrem friend and the place suppos get pretti pack when the game are play which is when they have some special price on beer and so forth but in all honesti it definit is not  a place i would look forward to stop in againi will agre with those review that are claim the food was bland it realli realli was i had the lobster ravioli and boyfriend had potato wrap salmon  his portion was generous and salmon cook well but there was veri littl flavor no use of herb spice seasoningnoth  my lobster ravioli was a fair skimpi portion for 25  four decent size ravioli and 3 small shrimp onc again i wouldnt mind this had it not been so bland the sauc was complet unimagin and left a lot to be desired

th servic was adequ we were seat immedi and our server was fine the water was refil in time manner and we didnt have to wait too long to get the check overal not worth the 50 for two entre without drink or an appetthis is a filipino market that also has other asian stuff you have to come here on a weekday at an odd time to avoid the crowd of littl old filipino ladi that cut in front of youim pretti tall for an asian so im sure they can see me but old filipino ladi dont care park can be chaotic filipino are not use to traffic signsrul so it can get frustrat be halffilipino i am awar of the lack of disciplin which is a trait common among filipinosi cant stand it

valerio is a bakeri to the left of the entranc of seafood citi they have good sugar doughnut that are super heavi and fillingand other filipino bread and bake good they onli take cash

when you walk in to the left is chowk to the right you got jollibe and red ribbon straight ahead is a bunch of stall sell phone card and a travel agenc behind all that is a groceri store

today i was look for ingredi for karekar for a potluck  that was my main mission i couldnt find peanut butter so i ask one of the employe stock the shelv excus me excus me where can i find peanut butter but he ignor me or hes complet deaf deni i shouldv talk in thick pilipino aksent and said hoy kuya where is da feanat vatter and who wouldv use his lip to point to where i need to go

httpwwwyelpcombizphotostortasahogadasguadalajarachandlerselectwfcsn36irna9lptznkcq3gdaxsrhny8vqs4qo8cmbzq

overal the food was ok  when we left it didnt leav me want more  im not sure i would drive all the way back here again

return factor  50the owner of vermont sandwich co just contact me and offer to make right what happen to me dure my last visit  nice gestur but i had to declin  i didnt write what i did for a handout but im give this place one more star for the offer

vermont sandwich co is veri high rate  for the owner to tri to make right by one negat comment among a multitud of posit say someth about the owner integrity

i think a return visit to vermont sandwich co may be in orderping that the sound the button on my short made when they bust open becaus i ate about 14 plate of food dure my gluttonfest
 
flush flush flush  i have a feel that the sound ill be make in about 30 minut from now

it a chines buffet that cater almost exclus to a hispan crowd hot sauc on everi tabl and 50 latin music play in the background

i guess this place was fine  some of the item were hot and fresh a few were old and dri out they did have about 30 item to choos from even some sushi but i didnt wanna risk it all and tri the tuna im not a gambl man like thati use to frequent china oliv not becaus it was so great but just becaus it was the best in the area when i was in the area

a few year ago i enjoy them better than i have the last coupl time i went  they use to offer a larger varieti of food i like but now offer more food i dont eat such as sushi instead
they alway have the typic item and usual theyr cook well
they do suffer from get fri item on the wrong side of the crispygreasi spectrum quit a bit  
drink are not includ 
worth the lunch price but not the dinner pricewhile my daughter was enjoy the awesom play area i was afford the opportun to reminisc about how treacher this locat drivethru can be

if your order is easi natur all is well but if you order a larg or specialti order that requir you to pull into the we need more time to fix your stuff space  look out

thes space are locat just past the second window at the end of the drivethru just as the lane turn left and narrow so if  you drive a big vehicl youll end up block the whole lane caus a massiv traffic jam 

so a word to the wiseif you are order a lot bite the bullet and go insid itll most like end up save you time and unnecessari frustratcame here for lunch and was pretti disappoint the wing were tini serious the smallest wing i have ever had like mini wing the meat plate sound good we order chicken breast in bourbon sauc and pull pork the chicken was good tender juici and had great flavor the pull pork was serv dri and had a weird tast to it like rubber even with ton of bbq sauc it was still dri the corn on the cob was mushi and the salad was wilt bad meal overal but good servic and ici cold blue moonthe slide scale of valu come into play here

confuci say he who eat at chain store often pei wei too much 

sure the ingredi are fresher but if the pei wei chicken has the exact same flavor profil as the orang chicken at panda whi pay twice as much

what look like a lot of varieti realli isnt  i felt that they could do a littl more with veggi i mean almost everi dish has snow pea and carrot disk and green onionscallion  not veri creativ at all

th dig provid a nice atmospher and busser were keep the lunch rush mess in check most  i have a problem with their method of put a stack of small plate and napkin on all the empti tabl  it onli seem nice and conveni to have if you want to grab and use them but they dont clear the unus away when buss so whos to say the previous diner at that tabl didnt touch or sneez all over them  
gross and mayb even a health violat or at least it should be in my eyes

il go back and tri other dish but onli when im sick of everyth els near by  pink pepper is right across the park lot after all  httpwwwyelpcombizpinkpepperthaicuisinephoenixhridyzph0ztery9pgfply9a

if you like pei wei but would prefer to patron a local own independ surpris similar equival to this popular chain check out moto sushi is a must   httpwwwyelpcombizmotosushiphoenixhridmesqboofukifpw3wccaq    the owner onc had custom fortun cooki print up and one of them said confuci say he who eat at chain store often pei wei too muchthis place is a bit differ than the one in tempe
they have on the menu hot tea but when we ask the girl for tea she said we dont have that but it is on the menu she said it is
their  menu is up on the wall
so then we said ok how about coffe also on the menu  she said well we have to make it
ok never mind
oth than that the food is veri good the bathroom are clean and the place itself is nice and clean

th servic was fast and accur  the food was consist with other del taco locationsit wont win ani culinari award but it cheap  fill  this locat was veri clean and the employe were friend  overal a decent experience

return factor  80this panaderia on 32nd street can be intimid to ani nonspanish speaker sinc the staff and the major of the custom of this panaderia do not speak english i stumbl upon this panaderia one afternoon with my friend dani i was crave a donut or some kind of postr the churro at del taco was not go to do it for me and lo and behold i came upon this treasur of a panaderia i was half expect someon to at least understand me but sad not it was abuzz with peopl the store is part bakeri part cafeteria where you can buy menudo and other hot snack and sit at the tabl to eat as you walk in and after the tabl there are shelv of dessert and pastri fill with cooki donut and the like so grab a tray and pick and choos and theyr all cheap i think one time we got ourselv close to 20 differ kind of goodi and paid a whop 750 it was awesom you have to admit that if a busi doesnt understand english they understand the languag of currenc but yea this was the kind of place where if you had ani question you were left to your own devic to distinguish and determin what bake good they were and if such tast good i think we were amus as the nonspanish speak pair play charad to the spanish speaker to understand us oh well it an experi and i will come backokay im surpris by baja fresh

almost a dozen year ago i rememb go to my first baja fresh when it was still a wendi concept in illinoi  arlington height i believ  the food was good  

at the time there was no chipotl to feed that quick upscal mexican hunger  so in mani way they were the onli game in town

a i mention in my recent taco cabana review a lot has chang  if feel like chipotl is give starbuck a run for it money in term of new locat  and that food chain has onli gotten better and still is the darl of wall street  

now wikipedia has creat a websit list all the mexican fast food chain  take a look and see how mani you have been to  
httpenwikipediaorgwikicategoryfastfoodmexicanrestaur  youll get high mark in my book if youv been to a taco time and taco del mar

her the skinni baja fresh doe a nice job with their food  i want to like them more than i do  their baja steak burrito is realli good and fair price for 699  but as you explor their menu item it becom somewhat uninteresting

mi suggest would be to knock out that half wall that separ the kitchen from the front so the custom could see the employe prepar the food  similar to that  er other mexican concept across the flw street  the employe here are except friend and offer free chip as you wait  nice

th food is good but the restaur with all that white is kind of steril  the next time you get some coupon in the mail give them a tri as we did  youll be pleasant surprised

enjoywe came here for my mom birthday and by we i mean a ton of us   cmon were latino you know we mob deep and with a bunch of kid in tow  we arriv at 700 pm on a sunday night  i guess kid arent allow past 800 but the place was dead and the coupl of peopl that were there all had kid too  

we had a great time  the sand volleybal court were awesom  there was a guy on the mic sing everyth from the eagl to michael jackson pretti funni  a bonfir was go and kid were roast marshmallow  it was a perfect night  unfortun i didnt order ani food or drink but my dad said his burger was the best hes ever had  the server was veri sweet but kept forget thing  the bathroom were gross

sur enough right after the food arriv someon came up to us and told us we had to leav when we were done eat  i think it asinin to treat your biggest money maker of the even like that  no lie im sure we doubl their revenu for the even on booz alon  ok i get that they have rule and all but realli there was onli one other tabl by that time  we left no problem  will i be back  yeah i cant think of anywher els you can play sand volleybal and booz it upwhat would i ever do without wienerschnitzel

it my holi place my templ my place of tribut 

and im not make a clever metaphor for the rise in obes and fast food consumption

you see to keep in line with my religion discordian i have to eat a hot dog or twoor three everi friday in rever to the goddess eri im not make this shit up look it up in our scriptur 

i experi for a while in find a suitabl regular sourc of weeni at first i tri do the hot dog cart outsid of the storebarstrip club thing but after a while i realiz that behind everi smile hot dog salesman is a tragic stori of heartbreak and shatter dream and i began to fear that eventu hot dog would begin to tast like cheat spous and children who drop out of med school with onli week left to graduation

i tri gas station mobil on the run and quiktrip especi becaus they have some of the best chili chees dog in all of creation i was content for some time thrill to be abl to fill up my gas tank while particip in a sacr ritual final religion was serv me instead of the other way around life was good

then one day i walk into a motr and inquir the clerk as to the fresh of the dogs

thi is a dramatization

good sir how long have these frank been on yonder grill
i dont know sinc last night i think
i say that ludicr have you ani idea how unsanitari that is
w leav them out until their sold they do the same at movi theater and whi do you talk like that are you gay or something
if by gay you mean happi sir then no i most certain am not i am not gay about these health violations

long i linger unhappili in the desert of unhappi where unhappi vultur feast on unhappi roadkill

whi would my goddess demand i ingest someth so foul

that just a rhetor question btw in the principia discordia it outlin exact whi we should eat hot dog eat a hot dog on a friday violat the dietari condit of everi major religion that how we roll

at the suggest of a friend i stumbl across wienerschnitzel which to this day i have yet to spell correct on the first try

not onli do they have the best chili chees dog ive had in a long time but also the best chili chees fri chili chees burger chili chees french fri burritosand they also have the hypocrisi insincer and apathi i look for in a religi institution

lik a sunday school teacher who tell their kid that kill is bad unless it america enemi ws has no regard for their own doctrin everi time i visit the drive through it the same nois no you cant substitut your french fri for a chili chees french fri burrito no you cant sub out your soda for a taste freez yet everi time i get to the counter there that same shadi cashier look both way befor give me my bag and warn me that it just this onc and not to expect them to do me ani favor next time 

that the kind of do as i say not as i do attitud i expect no requir from a religi establish i demand the same amount of twofac clergi that is avail to everyon else

everi time i hear them say thank you have a nice day it wrap an invis fuzzi warm blanket over me it remind me of my youth of cranki oblig bless yous that come after everi soundbarrierbreak sneez of everi daze and listless may the lord be with you in everi cathol servic sentiment is veri import to me in a religi institut i may attend this templ of consumerist worship the rest of my life i need to be abl to rememb it when im away eat normal peopl food and do those thing that reason rationallymind peopl do with their free time when not eat hot dog in heathen ritual and talk to dolphins

and apathi yeah theyr pretti apathet whenev i show up but so am i i guess big deal who cares

oh also they charg extra for allbeef hot dog which mean that the lower option is made up of mysteri meat i keep hope i bite into one and accident eat a demon or something

th best part of ws is that like a small church on the side of a countri road that where church are right i havent been to one sinc i attend a wed in waco tx ws has it own regular usual specif to each branch probabl becaus with all that chili and chees we eat we cant be bother to travel too far to you know tri other thing out we all laugh and smile and laugh at each other consum by a sens of camaraderiemutu assur destruct 

wienerschnitzel realli doe bring me closer to my goddess

what would i do without it

i dunno eat spaghettio with hot dog cut up in them at the rate im go ill be lucki if i can make it to the can open without have a heart attackel encanto dos is aok if your in the area look for a good place to eat  this is the littl sister restaur of the el encanto in cave creek  there are subtl differ in their food between restaur but this locat is pretti good and it easier for us to get to from the i17

w love the ambianc of this restaur especi their patio  if given the option and weather permit i recommend din on their patio  they have a wonder fire place on their patio and they have heater for when it get colder  on some weekend night they have the most wonder guitar player play while you dine  it cool to see some of the local ride their hors to the restaur and tie them to the post surround the park lot

w alway have good servic but then again im not afraid to say someth when their servic is slow  they alway acknowledg when they are slow and make amend to step up their servic to ensur your din experi is except 

their queso and spinach con queso are some what averag but their salsa and chip are good and a nice start to your dinner their taquito are a bit dri but then again ive never had a taquito that wasnt dri and come with a wonder chipotl salsa for dip you cant go wrong with their seafood enchilada ani of their enchilada either pollo or steak smother in their homemad mole sauc red or green chili sauc their fajita are also good either steak or pollo their pescado enpapelado and carnita poblano relleno are ok but dont plan to order them ani time soon

thi is a good place to go with the famili and friend if your in the area note  this is a review specif for their glutenfre burgers

when i found out uncl bear did glutenfre burger i rush over to tri one with eager anticip  they serv bun from the glutenfre bakeri in phoenix glutenfre creation  sinc i love gfc i was happi to support them and anyon els will to put gf item on their menu

i order the og burger ad thousand island pickl and bacon  so here the deal appar the gf bun are much smaller than their regular burger bun so what they do is liter fold the 12 pound patti over like a quesadilla to make it fit  this creat a few problem most import screw up the meat to everyth els ratio  way too much burger perbit which pretti much elimin the tast from the other top on the burger all you tast is meat  i guess this is fine if you love eat plain hamburg but i get a burger for all compon of the burger  it would be better if they just gave you half the meat and didnt fold the patti over

second issu was the price  base price for the burger was 950  they then charg anoth 225 for the glutenfre bun  that is ridicul  when it was all said and done with bacon burger came with fri and a glass of water for drink tip includ my total was 1575  that is just crazi for a mediocr burger imo  

they have a great idea serv gluten free burger they would liter get 100 of my burger busi and im sure about the same as other glutenfre diner  bottom line when a buddi want to go grab a drink and some bar food ill recommend we go here so at least i can eat someth but the price point prohibit me from eat there even semiregular  they also sell chicken sandwich on burger bun i may go back and tri one of thosebasic generic mexican kindoffast food restaur but like mani of it brethren in that genr of eateri it serv decentqu sticktotherib fare i do like the fact that they have a drivein that open way late at night so that i can still get a tasti and substanti  dinner after a veri late night at workhere is the skinni  food was okay a littl too salti for my tast but servic and trickeri was at an all time high at this place

th joint is upscal and the ambienc is pleasur  definit not a place where you want to take small kid who are loud  we were veri impress by the tradit dark wood decor and bronz western theme statues

it took a while to get our foodmuch longer than expect  but it a fine steakhous these type of thing take a while  we enjoy each other compani while we wait no big deal  we knew there was a problem though when a supervisor or manag came up to apolog for the length of the waitthat made us pay attent  we also notic that we hadnt seen our server for a while  we then notic that a differ server was come to our tabl to pour wine from our bottlei joke said hey you must be our new serverh had a slight grin and then went away

this was the first question ask to me by ali the owner as we sat down on a plush victorian sofa

mi girl found it i confid said as she gave a sweet smile to the two of us

w were then present with dare to say it cute menus along with a wine list which she note offer half off flight on monday score 

i had a sauvignon blanc  flight which believ it or not was probabl one of the better blanc select ive ever come across for 7 buck and chang impressive

what lack was the food the chees plate which is your wine bar stapl had an astound 17 dollar price tag that we fell for what we got howev wasnt a 17 dollar plate though you dont serv mini toast with exot chees  that just not right 

next up were the stuf mushroom with crab and what tast like bleu chees again good concept howev the damn fromag was so strong one realli couldnt tast what the idea was realli meant to offer 

to wrap it up ill go back for sure but onli for vino as like the claim state it realli is unpretenti uncommon for fakesdalthis place get so much hype and so mani peopl alway suggest it for meal but after hear aw stori about roach and hair i was reluct to go back 

thank my meal was insect and hair free but there was absolut noth memor about it i had the crab wonton which were virtual tasteless my pad thai the same i had to load it up with lime and rooster sauc for there to be anyth to wrap my tongu around howev my friend had the mandarin kung pao and it was yummi i ate more of that than my own meal to me it is just quick chain food that i could easili buy in a frozen packag and throw in my wok for about half the price one thing i will say is that their staff is eerili friend and i dont know if it was my extrem enorm asian inspir tattoo that they were mesmer by but i was ask how i was do at least 10 time by sever differ dine room attend ill give them that and their orang tea i could drink that for daywent tonight  and although there were still a plethora of realli bad parent who expect that we look forward to listen to their ill behav howl children the magarita were better  not exact strong but better  the real downer to float a shot of tequila on top of my margarita would be more expens than the margarita itself omg what the point  give a thirsti girl a breakmy friend want to tri this place out it liter a cute littl hous turn into a restaur 

they have a realli cute outdoor patio you can sit at or you can sit insid the hous lol we order the cinnamon roll to start that was yummi i order the corn beef hash i like the corn beef in this plate everyth els was pretti basic my friend order the biscuit and gravi which she enjoy 

the servic was good one thing i would recommend is put a sign right outsid the door for peopl to sign in for a tabl there was just a littl clipboard  that was veri easi to miss and no one outsid so we werent sure if we were suppos to seat ourselv or what also anoth thing i didnt like is if you want to split your plate with your friend or whoever they will charg you an addit 150 for that what other then that i thought it was a veri cute littl brunchbreakfast place it was around 6pm on my third day in phoenix when i was final abl to hang out and catch up with two dearlymiss sbc alum lynn w and clair origin wed set out for the dessert place next door but i had just return from a 10hour day trip out to grand canyon and back so a slice of pizza sound perfect

th joint look veri collegi and indi full of simpl design bright color and decis lack of brand although further inspect reveal it to be a widespread though not yet promin franchise

for just shi of 20 i order three slice and drink for our impromptu dinner myself gravit toward the simpl pesto slice as usual

for the price per slice it seem a tad on the expens side but the slice it flavor and ingredi is decent the better option or deal is probabl to get one of the heartier sound whole pizza onlin menu httpweborder3microworkscomzpizzaitemaspxmenuid2477  

nonetheless it hit the spot and servic was veri friendly

ther a cool symbiosi of z pizza be immedi attach and share a space with pink spot next door

savori and sweet in a singl space gluttoni aboundthree door down from just relax  after a sooth 45 minut foot massag i carri the asian theme to noodl ranch  cool interior with blue wall upsid down red umbrella and old photograph of vietnam  

sinc this was my first visit i opt for the 750 lunch special with a pot sticker a green salad and stir fri chicken with peanut plus ad a pot of hot jasmin tea for anoth 2  attent servic and good valu but averag qualiti food  the stir fri veget were hot and tasti but i was not impress with the textur of the chicken  i would have prefer all white meat

next time i get a foot massag i will tri order from the menu  on my visit there there were  quit a few patron who seem to know what they want  henc the need to ventur away from special and go with the good karma from the foot massagfirst thank you to yelp gabi and sol y sombra for the gift card it made me go back and visit a lot quicker i love the decor here the booth are so comfi you may never want to leav and that could be veri danger here unfortun i am with the minor on this one after this visit i want to make it here for brunch but that didnt happen so dinner it was there wasnt too mani other parti it was pretti empti in there when we arriv off season and no sommeli this day we sat insid first and order some peroni am i the onli one who find an italian beer here a littl weird to drink some tomato bread which the server prompt correct me you mean pan con tomat yes i wont touch that one then the tortilla espanola i tri those at the oye alreadi and they were delic i would probabl come here just for those

now we had forgotten there was happi hour and were told it was onli on the patio or at the bar we thought it was a tad odd consid the place was so empti so we decid wed like to move out on the patio mind you hh was almost over so the waitress tell us that we would have to close out the bill then move outsid where she would be our server again huh the hub ask what he thought was a manag if it would be a problem he was just a waiter and told us yes that will be a problem so after a lot of look at each other like wtf our waitress final get the manag pleas forgiv me i am so bad w name peopl he came over and told us we didnt have to move if we want that we could order off the hh menu thank you at that time we decid to move outsid anyway for the view they help move all our stuff over after that dilemma everyth went pretti smoothly

w continu with the soft lettuc it was realli good the almond were awesom but i cant say anyth special about the sauc unfortun next came the calamari def worth tri it a good size portion and worth everi penni the shrimp i will probabl pass on next time they were ok not worth 4 for 16 eh i did not think they were that special tast but they were big then there was the piquillo pepper it was stuf with tuna i was expect raw tuna or someth not can it wasnt spici at all think tuna salad but there was caper instead of pickl it wasnt anyth special go for someth els or id suggest it for lunch more than anyth we did not have ani dessert noth realli appeal to us on the menu so we just order anoth round of drink the mojito i had for desert was ok as well

thi place remind me of the scottsdal stereo type where i was not blown away by the food and the normal overpr drink i can see this be a neutral water hole where the cougar and trout come out of their lair to play simultan dure the cooler month i did not see anyon dress up so i am guess that more of a night thing overal this experi was 2 star the ambianc and the drink get one more super strong drink here and with the possibl that i order the wrong thing this time i will be back to tri more stuff and figur out what i like i want to give more star i realli realli do  hope thing wont be too confus next timei realli want to like this place i did what with the tapa and the good review it has i figur that i was in for a real treat and while the ambianc of the restaur definit deliv  a cool dark interior with comfi booth and highback chair isnt somth i scoff at  the food wellit left someth to be desir 

let me commend our waitress though becaus she was great  no complaint about the servic itself and also my diet coke came with it own carafehow cool is that definit an awesom idea

now for the bad news the tapa themselv we began by ask for our waitress recommend on food and end up order four dish that she mention five total
    tortilla espanola this was one that she didnt mention but some yelper did so we start with what appear to be potato au gratin minus the chees serv in the form of deepdish pie with sour cream drizzl on top that the best way i know how to describ it and it was pretti good butveri rich a littl more than i was wantingexpect for my first dish but this one we actual did end up finishing
    calamari with smoke paprika and citrus aioli im an ailoi fan myself but someth about this particular one didnt do it for meit was just way too citrusi i think im pretti sure that we onli end up eat half the bowl  and it wasnt a huge bowl
    grill short rib with salbitxada and green onion short rib are probabl one of my fav dish of all time so believ me when i say ive had a few in my lifetim  and these were just not cut it in ani way im will to admit that this could just be becaus they were too underdon for my tast which is of cours a matter of prefer but even the outer more done part didnt have great flavor and the bizarr stuff underneath wasnt exact delectablei took a bite of it have no clue what it was and was quit unpleas surpris by the flavortexutreyik we didnt end up finish this dish either
    sear alaskan halibut with carrot sauc and dung crab salad all of the compon of this dish just sort ofclash it hard to explain but the weird flavor combo complet overshadow what was actual pretti decent halibuthow sad
    grill brocolli caramel onion sauc sea salt and oliv oil this was probabl the best thing we orderedpretti good flavor and grill still not good enough to get again

non of the food was spititintoyournapkinbecauseyoucantswallowit bad if it was this place would be get a heck of a lot fewer star than 3 but it justwasnt that good i dont think id order ani of the item that we got again grant they have a lot of other dish on their menu butthes were all thing that our waitress recommend so if these are their topshelf dish i dont see much reason for me to ever come backhey this isnt westminst san diego san jose seattl or even portland this is snobsdal az where it is near imposs to find ani ethnic food anywher close to be authent 

either it is a larg showoff over decor place with a patio and flame torch with a menu that cost an arm and a leg with blond girl in tight black t shirt serv lousi food or it is low rent chain that pass for asian food by throw soy or teriyaki sauc on rice like the low end and ubiquit samarai sam and other similar take out teriyaki place that compet with chun king and cup a noodl 

so for snottsdal this is pretti darn good it is in a strip mall on n hayden near where i use to work and odd enough next door to a samurai sam 

it has been here for about 3 year it is clean and nice and they have most of the basic you would fine in those other major citi with larger viet popul of cours pho noodl soup vermicelli noodl plate bun and some rice plate that appeal to those in scottsdal more use to pf chang 

also for the low fan are popular spring roll egg roll and fri shrimp wonton but for the viet miss more than the popular american dish they also have banh xeo and com like rice dish 

they do have more chines like dish to appeal to those who never had vietnames food and couldnt wait at pf changs

th price are a littl high 799 for a medium pho tai bo vien which could cost 2 less on the coast but there isnt a vietnames restaur with 20 mile of here and it isnt ani better020210

ord their white pizza for takeout  was told that it was extra garlicki and made w fresh roast garlic  was a littl disappoint when told the onli chees use was mozzarella  the thincrust pizza was just mediocr  a bit on the salti side yet didnt realli tast flavor i attribut this to the singular use of mozzarella im use to at least two blend some of the combo ive tri at other resto includ one or more of the ff mozz fontina ricotta asiago white cheddar and gorgonzola  while there was garlic i realli didnt find it particular strong in garlic flavor as i was warn it would be over the phone  as to it thincrust again i found it just ok  i grab a slice as soon as i sat insid my car and the crust alreadi wasnt as crispi as id prefer it to be and by the time i arriv home the crust was complet soggi and i dont live veri far from apb

i would like to give amano white pizza anoth tri befor complet write it off as a pass but perhap i should just stick to their other pizza combin select which have proven themselv veri good in the past almost as good as pizzeria bianco and wout the waitthis is partial a review about serverdud or serverdudett you know that server the one who think theyr too cool to be serv or theyr just miser im pretti sure i had that server tonight no smile no person seem complet uninterest classic serverdud or mayb he is just too introvert and should look into other job option 

im not even gonna bullsht you i know serverdud becaus ive been serverdud and guess what i dont serv anymor becaus im too cool no im a complet nerd but i just didnt enjoy serv peopl so i came off as a prick sometim anyway ill get back to serverdude

st franci has a veri nice ambianc as other have said ill give it that 
the food was good it didnt blow my mind or anyth but it was good

w had the bake goat chees to start a tomato and goat chees concoct serv with crostini i like it but it wasnt anyth too differ from other goat cheesetomato creation ive had

for dinner i went with the pig dip it a french dip but instead of roast beef the sammi consist of pork product pork loin prosciutto bacon veri good i would have prefer it for lunch more so than dinner though that not their fault im just throwin it out there 

so back to my pal serverdud my dinner was drop off by a runner or anoth server i had one last swig of my beer of cours i took that swig after my food was drop off think my server would come back short to check on us and i could ask for anoth one nope

i had to drink the clear tasteless liquid throughout most of the meal i wish i could tell you im talk about vodka but no i mean water there a time and place for everyth and this was the time and place for my beer ala i was with none

i was near done with my dinner befor the server came back to our tabl i didnt break out my stop watch but id have to say it was at least 15 min easili that a long time to be without beer

 when he final came over and ask if we want anoth round of drink i told him not to get me anoth becaus i was alreadi almost done i was alreadi irrit and wouldnt enjoy the beer anyway night ruin ok not entir but i was disappoint becaus overal the food was pretti good but ol dude was just a downer 

i had a 3 star night but im sure this place is a solid 4 on the regulari went to celsius when they first open and i was impress  unfortun i think theyv gone down hill a bit sinc then  it probabl been around 3 year sinc my initi visit and ive been a hand of time sinc then  both to eat in and to take out  

i have to say my most recent experi was veri averag  the servic was ridicul slow and the qualiti of the roll we order was just mediocr i was with 2 friend and all of our food came out at differ time  we had 2 server take care of us but even between the two of them they could not manag to keep our water fill  we order a varieti of sushi includ an order of salmon sashimi a spici tuna handrol a tuna maki roll futomaki and anoth of their specialti roll  we also had a coupl of miso soup and a salad  

i love sushi and it rare for me to allow extra sushi to go to wast but last night none of us want to finish the 6 or 8 extra piec that lay on the tabl in front of us  i think that is a sign that it was not so amazing

anyway the place was pack and it nice that they have a patio but celsius could probabl stand to brush up on their servic  i cant complain too much though it was 56 total for 3 of us not bad for sushi  howev i probabl will not rush back to celsius i would probabl choos to go to male pure or sushi broker befor return it not bad but just averag blah mediocr soso  i think you get the pointin my never end quest to find a good east coast deli hot pastrami sandwich i decid to stop by heidi brooklyn deli  i was somewhat apprehens yet optimist when i pull up to heidi for lunch the other day after all there were sever sign of good as care evalu my surround upon enter heidi 

sign 1 this place was go to be good they were veri busi when i walk in henc there might be a reason whi busi usual  good eat     

sign 2 this place was go to be good i notic there were a lot of older peep aka snowbird eat here as i walk in henc there might be a reason whi older peep usual know where the good deli are     

sign 3 this place was go to be good the smell of fresh cook bread hit you in the face as you walk in henc there might be a reason whi fresh cook bread usual  fresh cook everything

wel to my chagrin this did not hit mark but it was an enjoy experi my hot pastrami was shave cold cut and heat my rye was the best featur of this main event  it was awesom well balanc with just enough crisp vs chew and extrem fresh my potato salad and cole slaw was store bought not fresh  i ask the person that was wait on me whi they dont offer more fresh option and she state it all about the bread and their fresh approach to sandwich select  

they offer sever differ sandwich select other than the tradit such as a chipotl chicken with guac spici may veggi on a baguett or bread of your choic  i sampl that as well on a second visit and it was good but most definit not east coast

lesson learn pay no attent to sign for peopl have differ tast and expect of what a good deli should be in phoenix  heidi is a great altern to burger and fri they have wonder bread and offer a good select of sandwich salad and soupthis was my first time experienc a dave  buster am i shelter mayb but most ive avoid them becaus i simpli dont like kid so when i think of an arcad potenti with scream children run around i break out in hive 

recent a buddi of mine told me that they have a good happi hour and also a game special on wednesday so i figur id give them a shot 

we spent our time upstair this is where the arcad and billiard room is locat youll know this befor even reach the top of the stairway there are the deafen sound of beep boop beep beep boop then as you reach the top all the flash lights

it remind me of a casino without smoke and with slight less despair ani despair that exist howev came from the employe not so much the patron there was about a 5050 ratio of employe that seem to complet hate their job and want noth more than to set the place ablaz then the other half who at least attempt to be pleasant so i would say the qualiti of hospit you receiv will be a coin flip 

back to the wednesday special it pretti good the game and even billiard are 12 price all day and ill give them prop on the billiard room it was nice 

the happi hour was from 4307pm and includ  12 price cocktail im more of a beer guy but their beer select is mediocr at best instead i opt for a key lime coconut margarita yeah i said it should i be asham mayb a littl but it was delici and honest an ador cocktail i wish i took a pic ill take a pic next time 

for dinner i got the philli cheesesteak i didnt hate it the entré also includ a 10 game card which was cool there are actual a list of differ 1699 entre that includ the 10 game card it a pretti good deal

i want to add that our server leah was one of the cool employe if a manag read this shes a keeper she was on top of her game all night 

the final verdict is that db is what it is i like it i dont love it but a good time can certain be had ill probabl be back for some more happi hour key lime coconut marg no shame ok mayb a littlwhat can i say about the golden spoon  could i say that they sell frozen yogurt could i say that their spoon arent realli golden yes and yes

i could also tell you that the select of yogurt is decent  if i had to guess i would say there are about 1520 differ flavor  when you add the 2030 differ top into the mix there is potenti for some creativ and tasti surprises

mi favorit flavor though i have probabl tri them all are strawberri cheesecak and cake batter  i alway get the same top graham cracker crumbl and strawberri top  whi am i such a closemind top order you ask frank mr shank becaus i order the crush afterdinn mint onc and it ruin my entir experi  it was like chew grate wax candl serious dont laugh

mi advic is to stick with the norm and stay away from the afterdinn mintat the suggest i offer myself up for sacrific from anoth yelper i went here for lunch  it is situat well back from the street in a strip mall  the major tenant is target and for spot purpos el paso at least the build is right on the corner

i opt for the 14 lb burger and fri for 299  with the addit of chees and a shake the total came to 646 with tax  i was an ok burger it came with a larg bunch of fri which were crispi on the outsid and soft in the middl and light salt  the shake came with spoon for a reason no way could it be suck through the narrow straw  

the menu board is sort of confus and i should have pick up one of the to go menus as i notic mani folk order from that  there are gyro and hummus which i would not expect to find in a burger shop  i notic sever of the adult order gyro so mayb i order the wrong thing 

this place is not fast  when it get busi the food take longer to arriv than to eat  unknow i arriv just as student from a nearbi school were also arriv and even though i got my order in befor them there were alreadi sever peopl wait for their order  by the time i got my meal the place was stand room onli and sever kid outsid  i would say this is a popular hangout spot even a coupl of their teacher were there for take outdrop by this walmart on the way to my friend hous to pick up some suppli for a bbq  it a walmart

 long lines

 lot of products

 good prices

i pick up some chip  soda and made my way out  the place was clean and i didnt have to wait too long in line

return factor  80i am by no mean a korean food connoisseur  in fact i can probabl count the number of authent korean meal ive had on my finger and mayb a few toes

chodang was such a fun experi  i enjoy the food and the compani  after all i was there with a group of yelper  i thought the servic was decent and so was the atmospher gotta love the music they play  the portion are larg and the price are afford but noth about my experi blew me away

whil cbtl is a decent chain some locat are better than other and this is just not one of them  ive been a hand of time to this cbtl for meet as well as stop in to get a cup of coffe or tea befor or after a visit to tripl sport it right next door  it just noth to write home about
last thursday even i declar this would be a meet spot for a group of us that need to get togeth to discuss an upcom event  it was a 530 meet and i arriv a bit earli to get a drink and find a tabl for us  unfortun there are onli 3 tabl that sit 4 peopl the rest of the tabl sit 2  there is a loungier area that seat mayb 4 in the back as well  luckili one of the 4 top becam avail as i wait but if it didnt we wouldv been sol  
i will say that i like cbtl sugar free vanilla flavor as well as their lemon frutea drink  tri it if you go it refresh and thirst quench suppos it made from lemon extract which is whi it has that tart flavor i love so much  overal i can give this cbtl 3 star  i think that actual pretti fairwith so mani great coffe shop in the valley this one is onli just ok in my book the locat is decent and a good choic when look for a nice patio to sit on or a quick cup o joe but it fill up quick the staff is friend as well im not a huge fan of their ice coffe though i order an ice mocha and watch them concoct it they seem to use sugar free powder add it to hot liquid and pour it into the coffe then add milk unfortun it didnt quit work for me and the ice coffe wasnt so ice and i tast chunk of powder throughout ive had their hot drink though and their regular coffe is decent i just wouldnt suggest go the ice rout unless mayb you go the frozen routenow those are pretti tastithis restaur look like a fast casual restaur like chipotl but it is a full servic restaur where tip is requir it is realli small insid the tabl are too small and the chair are uncomfort the food is good thoughth complimentari bread they give you is fresh and melt in your mouth it is so good  they top it off with chop onion and herb and they use the same bread for their sandwich and pizzath onli downsid for me is there are not mani vegetarian option so i order a caesar salad it was pretti good i can usual tast the anchovi in the dress but not here   we ate here on a wednesday and my nephew ate for free i dont know if kid alway eat for free or what but i thought that was a cool perk if you have kid despit the uncomfort set i enjoy my meal next time ill probabl order my food to godang this place was hard to find on yelp my friend and i came here on a break from studi after all agre on chines tasti asian work out pretti well we had walk out of some place call chop chop that was a blatant panda express ripoff and this was the next place that we could find

i had the honey walnut shrimp which turn out to be way more fri than the waitress led me to believ nice sale ladi the hot and sour soup was pretti good and my buddi kungpow chickenshrimpbeef was spici enough to clear the sinus nice 

overal the atmospher was a littl dingi and most of the peopl that were come in were get their food for takeout it is veri close to the rental hous though and they do deliv so for the next round of class im sure well be use them for our late night bender er i mean studi sessions

oh theyr not just chines their menu say that theyr asian chinesejapanesethai   ill tri their curri next roundnice select on tap and nice atmospher  unfortun the food doesnt quit get to the 4 or 5 star mark

i was excit to see the tradit haddock use for fish and chip especi when i order the larg portion to share with my wife  when the plate arriv with a pound of haddock in two long slab hang over the plate that what im talkin about i was thrill  then a mild case of disappoint set in  the fish was slight overdon and tast a littl fishi  i also did not like that the chip had a coat  

oh well  we are a long way from the atlant arent wei discov this busi through a websit call mercolacom a larg altern health site with a twice week newslett i am a selfproclaim health freak and one of the tool i use to achiev this end is unpasteur raw milk the health benefit are phenomen but due to aggress lobbi milk must be pasteur in order to be sold at market this process destroy the nutrit valu of the product and creat a demand for those who are awar henc the reason for my review the farm is noth special but what els would i expect it to be it a farm if your health is someth you valu go to mercolacom and read the research onli two thing are of a higher valu to me jesus and famili without good health the qualiti of your life will sufferim a huge fan of southerncajuncreolesoul food and i realli thought that this restaur miss the mark a littl bit and i was especi disappoint becaus it is not far from my house

it a not too busi restaur in a strip mall that seem to possibl be famili own  i order the gumbo but they were all out so i went with the crispi catfish with a side of macaroni and chees  my husband order the fri chicken with potato salad and coleslaw  while we wait we were brought some cinnamon biscuit that were pretti tasti  his was definit the standout order  the fri chicken was veri good and i would go back to order it  he said the potato salad and coleslaw were fantast  my catfish was soso and the macaroni and chees was dri as if it was bake a lot earlier in the day  the sweet tea was veri good and i savor everi drop  i decid to end the meal with some good ol peach cobbler  the crust was veri good but i was super disappoint to find can peach as the fill  i realli thought for a small independ restaur there would be fresh peach  bummer

il go back again but ill either give the gumbo a shot or stick to the fri chicken  i am interest to tri the fri green tomato though  bottom line a good not great dine experi for the soul food cravei was go to give jeepney bistro a 4 star review until my most recent visit this past sunday the food need to be kept warm instead of at room temperatur plus the tast of the food wasnt the greatest on my last visit so after at least a half dozen time patron jeepney bistro im just go to say that sometim it great and sometim not so good anybodi can have a bad day i would rate this restaur at 35 stars

when thing are right the caldereta menudo adoba and sinigang are delici i usual take some food home to eat dure the weekyou want a monster sandwich that will challeng the hunger of even the burliest man go order a dagwood from gandolfo deli it roast beef turkey ham pastrami swiss cheddar lettuc tomato onion pickl mayo spici mustard salt and pepper as close to nirvana as im ever get in case you couldnt tell by the ingredi i was a littl indecis about what kind of sandwich i want so i just took the works

dur lunch it can get a littl hairi in gandolfo deli and im not talk about the number of peopl there which is mani but the ratio of male to femal which is veri high me be the onli custom lack a y chromosom there is a reason whi this is so these sandwich are monstrous meat and chees concoct slather in sauc and serv big i could easili make a phallic refer about all these men consum massiv hoagi but im go to take the high road this review

i was consid the hard salami smother in sauc but i didnt know if it would be fill enough

okay so the low road suit me better 

i opt for the 249 meal deal to complement my dagwood which left me with a gigant sandwich a quarter pound of potato salad and a regular ice tea with plenti left over for dinner that night it was close to ten buck after tax which is a littl bit on the pricey side but at least i made two meal of it 

the potato salad was decent but lack salt like they didnt bother boil the potato with this necessari ingredi i love me some salt get me a lick and ill take a chees grater to it to season my meal or make me a salt flavor ring pop for those mid day crave my blood pressur will curs you but ill be sing your prais after ad this magic ingredi gandolfo potato salad got pretti good and they get extra credit for use red potato leav the skin on and prepar it with vinaigrett and mayo instead of mustard yum

it pretti decent for a sandwich shop and the menu is intimid in size and offer you could do much wors coughblimpiescough so give it a whirl if you find yourself in the areathis is my second time at casa filipina i was hope that this would merit a 4 mayb even 5 star review but ala i was disappoint and even embarrass that i suggest this place to a fellow yelper 

i rave to jetta r oh this place is so cute the food is amaz and the servic was great we should total hit this place up for lunch 

we walk in the door and were treat like i was on my first visit seat given menus and place mat water and silverwar were prompt produc 

we even had some of the curious dish explain to us 

just a note the food was realli good the first and second time i order the bistek tagalog this time i felt it was lack juici and the meat was difficult to cut with a fork but the first time i order this dish it was so succul it melt in my mouth 

one plus i didnt receiv last time was the offer for a second help of rice 

i ask for soy sauc and the waiter said hed be right back he disappear and then start talk with anoth custom for 20 minut 

then jetta and i decid to order dessert it is a bakeshop after all 
i order the creme brule but when they came to clean the tabl off i want to save my spoon the gentleman whom i think to be the owner said that he would bring me a clean one jetta be the ladi she is decid to wait until my spoon arriv after 10 minut of wait i told her to dig in final while take food to anoth tabl the owner apolog for forget about my spoon 

usual i am one for forgiv but not when there are onli four custom in your restaur and jetta and i are two of them 

i cant believ how i went from super impress to complet devast i want to tri you again cfb but i just dont knowi hate have to give out three star review for me 1star isnt the worst possibl rate you can an establish a 3 is becaus 3 star mean it invok no reaction to you neither joy or disgust no pleasur or pain 

id rather eat at a realli shitti place that ill rememb than a soso eateri that ill forget the moment i get back into my truck

if i want mediocr take it or leav it food ill just cook for myself kthxbye

a bfef best frienemi forev claric w and i frequent have lunch togeth in the peoria area the decis on what to eat is usual made use the follow criteria where havent we been that we can yelp about

our last lunch involv us go to hope kee and get all wrap up in their cutesi snack section and come in late to work so we need somewher relat closer with no hello kitti gummi lip to distract us from our voyag back

claric suggest casa filipina a filipino place by the lenni burger somewher near but not necessarili 35th avenue

w were welcom in by the staff and taken immedi to a nice cozi tabl by the window we were given our menus by the excit and talkat waiter i would come later to know as that fuck guy 

at first i was a littl troubl read the menu i was onc in a relationship with a filipino girl that was so tumultu and unlov that when i serious thought of break up with her that my first thought but  man i love her mother cook 

but asid from the adobo and lumpia i saw noth els on the menu that i could recal from all those awkward awkward famili dinners

i cant tell if this mean there more to the cuisin than im awar of or that said ex mother was as well as a good cook a fuck liar 

either way im glad i left her in the end anyway

i order the dinguan which translat as chocol pork

dont be fool by the name all you sauci foodi out there think of that iron chef america where they made savori dish with chocolate

chocol pork is actual pork cook in pig blood 

ill repeat that

it pig blood it call chocol pork becaus the blood take on a brownishblack hue after it been cooked

aft hear this from that fuck guy claric chang her origin order we even order the same thing arent we just the cutest to the bistek tagalog which she was familiar with and knew she would like

al the entri come with at cfb is a side of ride im not sure if it jasmin white or saffron becaus i alway opt for noodl when given the option 

and if you get that fuck guy that rice doesnt even come with soy sauc after serv us he disappear into the bakeri talk it up with some of the other custom claric didnt get her soy sauc until after we had finish our entre and were on our second help of rice 

thank my chocol pork came with a lot of sauc and i was abl to dribbl it on my rice 

that right muchacho we tranni prefer blood on our rice you think about that the next time you tri to tell us what bathroom we can use amigo

i couldnt tast the pork all i tast was the blood they couldv just dump a quart of blood on my rice and call it a day the textur was nice though

claric wasnt as fortun with her dish while ive tri to stay away from beef it enough of a commit to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfer with my eat habit i had some of the bistek and it was passabl it remind me of beef jerki with it dri spici rough good but not sure if that how it meant to taste

mor of the stori claric entre did not make it own gravi which made eat her rice a littl inconveni 

and serious just rice realli good rice but serious how hard is it to make good rice even my neighborhood sopooritstealsitsrecipesfromotherrestaur chines place give you an eggrol or wonton with your meal 

as the place is so fuck proud of it dessert we order some claric got the creme brule and i got the mango tart that fuck guy was in the middl of bring claric her spoon when he caught the attent of anoth custom so we sat for a good few minut wait to dig in in the meantim i manag to come up with a name for the color of the fill in my tart  burnt earwax 

mi tart was about as tasti and edibl as that term would imply

claric creme brule was good albeit a littl cold by the time that fuck guy came with her spoon

on our way out i learn that the bill had to be over 10 dollar befor they would accept debit

aft i imagin beat everi one of the staff near to death with a roll pin i got an eclair to go

what i got was a bunch of whip cream between two piec of rockhard pastri that youd get at frys essenti a diabet sandwich

casa filipina isnt good but it not bad

and it pointless to make reserv here for larg group here weve had issu a coupl of time most recent we had a busi lunch here a few week ago and call and confirm our parti of 14 twice and when we got there on the day of our reserv they act complet clueless and becaus it was dure a busi lunch time it took them awhil to get some tabl togeth to seat ustakeout onli  ive never tri the option but if you place your order onlin you can get 20 off your bill  mom tri and like the meatbal here theyr ok and the fettucin alfredo id order were good  when i crave for the dish a coupl of time i need someth quick and didnt have a way to check out other option  it a chicagochain which i never care for while i live in the chicagoarea so i rare order from here nowi am not sure whi this place is receiv such horrid review   interest that a competitor open across the way and a 1 star review show up that mention the competitor   let me just say that this cold stone is a typic ice cream shop experi  pleas dont allow negat review to detract you from stop in to see what this place is like   the cream is cold and sweet and delici  

when ive gone in the servic was prompt and the cream was good   the shop was also neat and tidi   ive stop in here on more than one occas  ive never seen this place look nasti or dirti   i would stop in again in the futur  

as far as the servicestaff ive never had an issu  the wait staff is general teenag   they act like teenag   

this csc is a typic ice cream shoppossibl the onli dedic japanes market in all of las vega  it is like mani have note small  locat in the same strip mall as the buffetasia wsahararainbow location

th first thing i notic is that the store is run by all japanes most like nisei or younger american and they will all greet you polit in japanes if you look remot japanes i guess i can also pass as a tokyo boy

they carri the usual drynonperish good ramen furikak nori potato starch ponju sauc japanes hair care product frozen item fish mochi ice cream some fresh item california roll noodl and some uniqu item that you will not find in other asian market tamago omelet pan  price is typic higher than other asian market i frequent in the area 168 and greenland but worth support if you want to have a local japanes market where you can go to buy stuff that you cant get without drive to california

3 star aoki dont know if it the holiday season or what but custom servic is lack here 

went in today and took a number i wait patient to be call and the man behind the counter start help someon whod come in after me i ask polit if hed call a number and he said he had but no one answer which was a flat out lie he wouldnt tell me which number he call and repli well which number do you have when i told him my number he just said oh sorri and continu help the custom who came in after me who didnt even have a number

loc in a small complex just step off the unlv campus and part of my regular workday walk rout cugino italian deli had long been on my to do list a saturday afternoon visit with two friend prove the rumor of prici yet good east coast italian classic to be quit accur  small in size and curt in custom servic it was with admit indecis that our group approach the cugino counter and order onthefli a sixpart meal emerg the 66 meal present in four cours with plenti of leftov and most impress result  undoubt a red sauc joint despit a multitud of housemad salad and sandwich it was with fri pillow of ricotta gnocchi that the meal began and with each creami morsel crispi on the exterior but virtual oilless i was immedi impress  a trend continu in the tender rice ball buri in housepul mozzarella and tangi marinara  obvious prone to overord particular in small group our trio next doubl down on a pair of pie and while the thin white pie prove somewhat bland to my tast with a mundan crust ting with semolina the sicilian dazzl as fresh mozzarella form soft puddl amidst aromat tomato sauc bright with acid and appropri devoid of sugar  breez through a plate of golden garlic knot aggress season with it namesak herb and kiss with butter befor finish the meal with prefil canolli alreadi experienc some sog it was with a bit of disappoint that i was inform neither housemad rainbow cooki nor tiramisu were avail outsid the freezer but with stomach full and leftov box as convers flow it would be hard to say i regret muchexcept perhap neglect the tripe soup or eponym cugino special sandwich both on the short there alway next time list though a repeat trek to similarbutbett montesano will most certain come firsthungri and short on time panda express might fit your bill

w were stay at red rock and decid to take advantag of their food court from our hotel room it was a bit of a haul to get to but otherwis was pretti conveni with the usual gamut of chain restaur  like a panda express

got two combin plate and some wonton to go a plate of fri rice with orang chicken and beij beef not that good and a plate of with chow mein those noodl are wayyyi better than i rememb with mushroom chicken and broccoli beef

w feast on the american chines grub in our room  there were no leftov sometim all you need is slightlypricey greasi food to keep you fed and panda servthis panda express in locat in the food court at red rock station if i come here dure the week i have a better chanc of get a tabl to eat at the tabl are clean which is a plus the soda here is a decent size compar to the other food court place and they give free refil this time i had beij beef shanghai angus steak and half rice half noodl my wife happili ate the mushroom from my angus steak and i had a tasti averag dinner just what i expect from panda after a movi or bingo this hit the spotanyth over medium rare is blasphemi onli toler if your preggo in my book okay and my experi at morton of san francisco did not go smoothly

i found morton here to be a tad better servic was prompt and everything
they made special menus for my friend bachelorett dinner with her name on it but had the date complet wrong it was juli but the menu said april haha they quick reprint new one with the right month

i admit i had low expect walk in there are a plethora of except steakhous in vega the strip is just chock full of them howev morton was doable

i alway order medium rare like i said anyth done over that is just carnivor sin i think morton and i need a  steak cook 101 becaus some sort of lost in translat thing is go on 

mi definit of medium rare is a warm red center what happen at morton 

it come pink 

this happen at the san francisco locat as well

sigh


i would have sent it back if i werent starv from be on a liquid diet 

dont get me wrong i dont mean i was actual on a liquid diet i meant the vega diet you know booze

anyway2012 fall restaur week dinner 1

it on the corner of e flamingo  paradis ive never dine at a morton i took restaur week as the perfect opportun to tri these never been place not that i need a good reason to eat out 

5012person three courses

what did we order

1st course
bak onion soup
chop hous salad

2nd course
6oz doubl cut prime pork chop
8oz filet mignon 5 upcharge

accompaniments
hors radish mash potatoes
gril jumbo asparagus

3rd course
crem brulee
chocol mousse

mi boyfriend didnt care for the soup but i thought it was quit tasti the chop salad wasnt made well the bleu chees was in big chunk so some bite you got none other bite you got a big glob dont get me wrong i love bleu chees it should be sprinkl on salad right

it was the first time i had horseradish mash potato it was good but i think my tongu was wait for garlic which i use to my boyfriend brought home the leftov so there you go worth eat again lol

im happi to say the star of the meal were the meat as it should be at a place like morton both mediumrar they were cook to perfect and oh so tender slight season to give that great crust on the outsid yum they offer a bearnais sauc with the filet mignon but as a steak should be it was delici just as is i enjoy order pork chop i learn that onli great steakhous make it right sinc pork is so prone to becom dri if not cook correct morton pork chop was veri good

w both enjoy the dessert the creme brule had the perfect caramel crunchi sweet top you love to crack open the chocol mouss was unusu thicker than most mouss but my boyfriend devour it still 

it was a good dinner attent servic it been a while sinc i ate at a steakhous where a maitr d lead you to your tabl want to give 4 star but someth is stop me mayb ive been a bit spoil dine at such great steakhous here in vega prime sw etc

il tri to be a morton fan next time aroundthis review is base on the new mapl tree sinc the restaur imposs makeov this week we went for dinner last night at around 730 i had never been to the mapl tree befor but was excit to tri it out to see what had been done i saw pic of what it use to look like and i love the new decor and look of the place the outsid need updat and they are in a pretti aw look plaza on the corner of spring mountain and jone we were seat right away as it was not veri busi i guess they have never been a dinner spot so this is all new to them and it showed

befor i get into food the servic need work they need to pay attent and listen when order are place and they should realli take the time to learn the new menu i understand it onli a day but you dont know if there is sauc on the burger or not the funniest moment came when one of the busser girl walk by and ask if i would like a refil on my soda that i hadnt even order but was brought to me anyway i said no thank you im ok so she ask if she could take the glass there was still a good amount of soda in it i kind of look at her confus and said no i would like to finish that the biggest negat for servic for me was that they had way too mani staff there not sure if this was becaus of  the show but their server and host were all huddl up by the hostess stand talk at the front of the restaur even one of the girl that look like she might be a manag or someth was there as well

on to the food i was pretti surpris that for a place known for it breakfast food that they now have a full dinner menu creat by robert irvin im sure but not what we were expect at all was actual a bit disappoint becaus i was hope for breakfast food i order the burger 10 w bacon ad and my girlfriend order the steak 14 the steak was a basebal cut and had good flavor but wasnt a great cut of meat the 10 filet at firefli is a much better buy the burger beefshort rib that the waitress ask if mediumwel was ok came out well done im pretti sure it was suppos to have chees accord to the menu and i dont eat tomato but they were pretti ugli look tomato the save grace of the burger was the awesom thick cut bacon on top delici the fri had the look and tast of store bought frozen fri but i could be wrong

i believ that with a few minor chang this place could do better i dont know if the dinner menu is go to save this place though a more well train staff would be a huge next step after the beauti interior renov that was done i would also high recommend they work on the store front as wellthis mcdonald is super clean and cozi sinc they did a complet renov insid and out normal i would not take the time out to complet a yelp review for this establish howev this locat is realli nice it has that colleg loung relax atmospher that is welcom for student and all who want some chill time nice comfi cushi black pleather chair and small intim tabl color art on the wall easi to relax eat studi or use their wifi for internet access

al you can drink serv yourself fountain drink are alway a plus at mcdonald the onli thing is they do not keep the fresh brew ice tea or sweet tea out like other locat do so you will have to ask for refil on that 

the food is good and the staff is fast and readi to go with your orderwas in the area and look for guacamol mix so i stop in here to see if i could find some  unfortun they didnt have ani so i left and went to the von on lake mead  buffalo

th store was clean but the park lot is a disaster

return factor  33i recent had a quick bite to eat at this locat  my usualbean burrito and 7 layer burrito

ord was accurate

plac was clean

food was ok

it taco bellnot much to say

wil i return  surechuck e chees sure has chang from when i grew up with it as a kid in the 80s but so has everyth els right it seem mani place have just gone down hill in everi aspect from when we were younger

th machin are tighter than a tick ass in give ticket they eat up token and give you veri littl in return i was smart and went to the compani websit and print out a 100 token for 20 coupon 

they alway have internet coupon i never pay full price for token when i take my nephew there for fun the prize select in which you redeem the ticket for is an even bigger joke most of this junk is dollar store or quarter machin worthi and break befor you step foot off of the properti they could do a lot better for the kid and get some decent prize i could have taken my nephew to the dollar store and given him the 20 buck to spend and he would have walk out with 20 toy that are way better than chuck e chees instead for 440 ticket he walk away with a flimsi straw a plastic bracelet and tini plastic blow up guitar veri lame for all of the token use up

mani of the machin were broken eat token and not return anyth so i had to call over employe a few time to fix machin or reimburs lost tokens

w eat befor we go 20 buck for a small pizza no better than frozen i dont think soas one of a hand of peruvianish restaur in las vega this place was a semifavorit of mine when i work in the area now that i work and live further away i come out here sparingly

you see im peruvian i mean i was born there but  was rais here so my concept of peruvian food has alway been stuff that my mom cook grow up but one of the thing my parent never cook and we onli had in restaur was pollo a la brasa rotisseri chicken made the peruvian way so whenev my parent had a crave for this they load us kiddo in the car and off we went to get pollo i havent been a kid for quit some time but youd be a fool if you thought i didnt get in my parent car when i found out they were on their way to the peruvian restaur they go for the chicken which they think is the bee knee i go for the peruvian cevich you should also know that peruvian cevich is differ than the mexican varieti and i might be bias but im pretti sure the peruvian version is better 

anyway the food here is ok it not at all someth to scream about though it is better than other peruvian restaur ive been to the portion alway seem smallish to me too the servic is ok though i swear the guy who work there is alway there ive gone on in differ daystim and hes alway there

th price are fair for peruvian cuisin special if your just in to get chicken and fri and salad if you upgrad to cevich or lomo saltado which is almost perus nation dish youll be more in the toni roma price rang than the applebe rang 

will i return here yes there are just too few peruvian option to consid not come hereanoth late night hunger fix i was out and about last night near downtown so this place was on my way home i order the taquito with everyth lettuc chees sour cream guacamol slice of tomato and rice and bean the menu is basic in spanish so i guess i shouldnt have been surpris when the women could not speak or understand ani english  it was touch and go interact with her im shock i got what i order without ask they give you two extra small green sauc and two extra small red sauc contain id rather they ask my prefer and give me more of just one but next time ill just ask for extra 

i order the taquito with beef but i heard her say pollo sever time to the cook so at least 3 time i confirm that i order beef on the 3rd time she final got it and start scream a bunch of thing to the cook the onli one i understood be carn asada so keep an eye on her 

the taquito and top were realli good easili some of the best ive had green sauc was great the rice and bean were absolut terribl ined i know i shouldnt be expect much from rice and bean at drive thru late night taco stand but this was serious terribl 

there a 1 charg to use credit card so bring cash my total price was under 10 includ the extra charge

i would definit return for the taquito andor to tri the taco next time im in the areai like kfc but i dont like this locat it is close to my work so that whi i went there for lunch today i order the dip em combo it come with 3 chicken strip a biscuit side and drink for 5 not too shabbi i also ad an extra side of mac and chees the slaw was a bit too wateri for my like but everyth els was ok they could improv on the custom servic a smile goe a long way just sayinim write this review for two reasons
1 there is no drivethru here
2 it 24hr are all roberto 24hr

so know that if you come here you have to leav your car gasp but their door will alway be open there arent mani 24hr fast food joint open in this area this particular locat is clean and has about 10 tabl insid ive never seen more than 2 tabl be use taco tuesday is 1 beef taco max 12 

that be said it roberto it tast just like everi other roberto you can find a better version of everyth on their menu somewher els in this citi the question is can you find it at 3ami enjoy come in here and have a beer or two or three with friend  sometim i bring my famili alongbut that onli for food  one of my favorit dish here is the kobe burger  it a must tri if your a fan of burgers

overal it a good time but it not a place we come to veri often

wil i return  im sure i willcame here tonight with friend with a 25 restaurantcom coupon must spend 35 not includ 18 percent gratuity

walk in this place i notic it need a make over i was less than impress with the wall decor and the weird set up who see a tv with a bench in front of it and next to the tv is a gum ball machin no tabl onli booth for 4 peopl and it was crowd especi when we had five peopl includ my toddler there wasnt even enough room for all of our plate i had to sit it in my lap not cool

th menu was good size no fri which i found was weird especi when you have pizza calzon wing chicken strip and salad on your menu a littl bum but there were so mani option that i wasnt phase 

he ask if we want drink and said yes then he point to a cooler and told us to grab them he offer ice but we all declin you would think that wouldnt be in the front that it would be in the back hidden from view 

next he ask if we were readi to order larg order of chicken strip oh well i cater today and we are out of those but i can run next door and buy some um no thank 

so we order the hot wing instead they were good but not great i like them deep fri then smother in sauc nope they were bake not crispi and the sauc was realli hot which the two guy in our group like 

larg pepperoni pizza was good ton of chees a littl too flimsey for my like but we all just fold the pizza and ate it that way too greasi for my like but overal it was good not for my first choic but good enough to come back it had that special ny tast must have been the spice or chees brought back warm memori of my time in ny

th last thing we order was a chef salad it was good veri larg and had shrimp on it ton of mozzarella which i love cant stand place that cheap out on the chees there was also two cruton who put onli two cruton if you cant put the right amount dont put ani at all oliv tomato and lot of lettuc was the main part of the salad it came with two small side of ranch to pour ontop i like that becaus i hate when restaur drown salad in dressing

ov all this place had delici pizza super hot wing a good salad but horribl seat and decor the seat arrang made it an awkward dinner and i wouldnt be back for that reason a lone take out would be an optionfinal i final got to go to a sonic after watchin a million of their commerci  we stop by right after we left the riobecuz it right next to it 

we pull in and i stare at the huge screen until i was readi to order then u push this button and u order we got there at like 330pm so it was happi hour 24pm everi day so we got larg realfruit slushi for onli like 80cent sweeet  hannah got the lemon berri and i got a strawberri plus we got tatertot  onion ring to keep ourselv awak on the drive home u then can pay with ur card rite there and then a dude on rollerblad roll out to give u the food hehe i felt like i was in the flinstones

th drink were sooooo good and for less then a buck how can u got wrong i wish there were more sonic around meth onion ring and tot not so good they were okay noth amaz but forsur ima hafta stop by here everytim in lv befor i go home the larg slush stay yum  frozen till i was near back to the octhe bf and i came with our friend who live on this side of town ive heard good thing about the food and they said there were certain thing they order that is quit nice there so we decid to give it a go 

we decid to do the dinner for two it 3999 and you get a choic of a soup or sald each a share appet a entre each and a dessert each it seem to be the way to go for dinner sinc the price are more dure dinner than lunchbut it seem the portion look to be the same in pic i dont get whi place do that 

lentil soup  pretti good actual lighter type broth and had some spinach and the squeez of lemon made it quit good 
greek salad  pretti plenti and the compon were fresh a bit overdress but still good 
our friend got other kind of soup chicken and a beef and rice one 

for appet we got 
baba ganoush  pretti solid a bit smoki and nice textur i like that there was a bit of pink pickl i wish we order a plate of pickl 
hummus  our friend got this and it was decent flavor and consist but the baba ganoush was the winner 

they handmak their own puffi pita which is a plus and ask for refil they give some oliv oil with zaatar 

beef kebob  it was just ok it could use more flavor and was rather small piec to be charg what they do on pictur it seem that kebob were much plumper back then 
moussaka  it was a vegetarian one and wasnt like a tradit stack style but more a stuf eggplant with chickpea and tomato sauc it their own take that remind me of lebanes stuf eggplant it was good for vegan version but disappoint that i was expect it to be someth els the thing that was crappi is our friend love their moussaka here and alway order it  when it had meat in it he was so disappoint he sent it back becaus it was not realli someth he was awar chang i dont get whi they would get rid of a classic i know they got request for more vegetarian option but that suck for everyon els could be in addit to not instead of stuf a eggplant with meat mix vs the chickpea isnt too difficult pleas dont let vegan ruin a good thing 

we got the baklava to go it was a plenti serv of 4 littl roll each which was nice it was pretti decent and odd we got two differ batch of one crispi and one not as crispi and we all had differ opinion which we prefer 

servic was odd she was nice in a kinda awkward way of tri to make chit chat but was definit struggl to serv 3 tabl with basic we order fri and hope for bread asap sinc there was a slight cranki babi with us too our bread was sit on the pas for a while so it was more crunchi than fluffi when we got the first batch boo it was also a wait for the bill even though it was clear mom and babi were gone my bf was get fresh air and we needed

for have spent 100 for dinner for 4 we expect far better it seem my friend who are regular even seem to be a bit upset and dont want to be back when that particular ladi is work they seem to onli get bad servic with her and hope that the moussaka will be back i live far enough that im not sure if i will make the effort to come back special sinc dw is next door mayb togo of some baba ganoushpretti standard over price casino restaur i had linguin pescator which was realli good but it definit did not justifi the 27 price tag in fact i have prepar someth veri similar befor with a mix seafood bag from trader joe for 999 which fed 2 peopl the servic was fine  noth memor but also noth to complain about  this is probabl a restaur to visit if stay at the casino but even as a local i would not go out of my way to eat here againstill on the search for good dim sum in vega  we found a place that offer the stuff on the cheap without the big name space or the carts

sur i definit would prefer dim sum sold the tradit way  ladi push their steam cart while holler out their ware  unfortun place like that are far and few between and near imposs if you dont have the space or business

th folk the husband and i head to kan kitchen to check out their cheap eat menu of 180 for most of their item on the dim sum list 

with a hand of custom on a weekday they ask if we were there for dim sum  they then provid us with their dim sum menu and their secret menu of thing list onli in chines  now mani small mom and pop restaur have this secret menu  sometim they are post on the wall and other time they are print out  they are onli a secret if you cant read chines which is the case with me  howev my dad can read it just fine and my mom has no shame in ask the wait staff to translat the menu for herexcept that sometim they can onli translat it back in chines sinc they dont realli know the english translat  at that point you need to understand chines or your sol

anyhow get back to the dim sum we mark off what we want and sent it to the kitchen  my mom immedi request that they bring the food at a slower pace and not all at onc  all at onc is good if you have a larg parti not so good with a parti of four  you want the food to still be hot otherwis your stuck with dim sum that cool down as we rush to eat them

thes were among the thing we ordered

 shrimp har gow 180
 steam pork shumai 180
 steam beef ball 180
 chicken feet in black bean sauc 180
 pork spare rib in black bean sauc 180
 duck feet roll 180
 fragrant dumpl 180
 tofu skin with pork and shrimp roll 180
 plain rice noodl roll 180
 pan fri dumpl with chive shrimp  pork 180

we also order beef brisket with rice noodl soup  my parent though the dim sum was good and we had to agre  it definit not bad for less than 2plate  sure there could be some improv but itll do if you want a quick dim sum fix on the cheap

servic was good  they were good about refil our teapot and clear our plate in a time manner  the waiter didnt mind explain the chineseon menu on the wall which was a good thing sinc that were all the good stuff was lunch special of beef brisket noodl soup or won ton mein for 495  at least we now know a place that offer good chines food for a fraction of the price than other other chines restaur in town

for those look for late night dim sum it also avail after 10 pm too  

35 stars

upd 050910

a recent lunch visit and just want to add a few things

instead of go for their dim sum menu  we went for their lunch special  they gave me a bunch of menus all written in chines which was useless  and then gave a few to the husband in english  which is what we end up use  

 beef chow mein hong kongstyl 495  chunki piec of beef and veggi were part of this dish  a standard size for the lunch special price

 chicken veget chow fun 495  i tri to chang this to veget chow fun but it wouldnt be part of the lunch special price  the waitress went over my lunch choic with me multipl time becaus she didnt want to get it wrong  i even said it to her in cantones but she didnt understand me  when the chicken chow mein arriv i had to send it back sinc it was suppos to be thick rice noodl  which the waitress made a point of emphas and still got it wrong  it was a standard size for the lunch special price  and although it say veget i do realiz that sometim it can onli mean onion green onion and bean sprouts

despit the initi confus over what we order and i did hear the waitress speak cantones and mandarin the food was fine for what we paid  noth special this time around  

3 stars

they do have hot chili oil on the tabl readili avail  and they do have rock sugar avail for chrysanthemum teakan kitchen has new hour post and they are 5 pm to 5 am  so not sure if they are still offer late night dim sum as an option  look like they are target a differ crowd now

nonetheless we came a bit after 9 pm and notic a steadi stream of chines famili there for a dinner too  they had a special menu  all in the chines though  the waiter couldnt do much with translat beyond beef chicken etc and end up give us the midnight special menu which is happili in english  all item are 499 each  score

w end up with

 deep fri salt and pepper tofu 499  littl cube of tofu that are deep fri and spici  we both enjoy this  
 steam chicken with mushroom 499  a veri simpl dish and it exact as describ  chicken and mushroom
 hong kong pan fri noodl 795  this came off the regular menu and we order the noodl separ from the sauc  yknow so the noodl stay crunchi and dont get soggi underneath too fast

overal we find ourselv there when were look for some authent chines food without all the frill  sure servic is what you expect with onli one waiter work and you need to wave him down when you want him  but it work for us especi when were given the special menu

upd 121110

drove by this even and they have shut their door  nearbi yi mei champion taiwan deli confirm that they are not closethis place is typic filipino market with some hot food in the back  this establish was cleaner and nicer compar to other filipino market  

the pancit bihon is excel  the best ive had in vegas

i also tri pork bbq and chicken adobo and they were both good  it a littl pricey but i will definit be go backfrom the outsid it doesnt look like much and base on that i havent been abl to drag my husband in there ever  final after drive all day from utah i succeed  he was just too tire to drive ani further and this place is about 1 block from the rv resort  

look can be deceiv   although it was veri dark insid like so mani other lv bar it was surpris clean cool and most import well ventil  plenti of peopl were smoke in there and at first i was put off by that but after a few moment i notic the lack of smoke bonus  

the food was aok  i had the fish and chip and they were just fine  not greasi decent coleslaw and crisp fri  there is a lack of breakfast restaur in this area and sinc steiner is a 24 hour joint i will stop by for breakfast next time im in town4 star for cake not sure about drink but 1 star to service

i think i didnt ask too mani questions
i think i paid correct amount
i think i didnt bother her sleep
i think
i think
i think she just unhappi to work or mayb work there

if so pleas dont work at this nice sweet bakeri store cuz you are go to make custom go away come on you are lose ppl  lose money if you are do busi especi with servic then pleas be nice a littl just a littl will be fine 

howev i like their cake for my breakfastfood never realli disappoint noth realli stick out for me to crave this place noth too special 

ive had the thai beef salad which is pretti good the spice level at this place isnt too spici a level 5 is veri toler i dont constant have to grab my water from the spici 

the pad thai here is kind of mediocr the noodl were serv to us over done and are stuck togeth which i dont like the flavor did go well togeth though

th servic is usual quick they check on you at the right time the food come out at reason time the restaur is usual below freez so bring a light sweateri got crab this past weekend in vegasjo stone crab that is what els did you think i was talk about 

this was my first time have stone crab claw  i thought they were just soso the textur was a littl like a flakey white fish dens  less sweet than dung crab meat my fave kind at over 10 per larg claw an order come with five a tast of joe doe not come cheap and the mustard sauc spici from the horseradish was good but im go to call overhyp on their namesak dish 

the three of us also share a crab cake entre 24 too much breadcrumb filler a salad  the second mortgag appet 16 which was the best thing we tri i especi like the jumbo prawn  shrimp  scallop cevich that was includ in the appet 

servic from everyon we encount was five star veri profession but given that ive had better crab cake at the palm a few door down  the stone crab hit my wallet pretti hard im give their food a lukewarm three stars

get stone crab in vega not so yummitwo time same order year apart
th chirashi bowlric sashimi and the special yummi grill kickerric season yummmm seawe deliciousness

i took it to go year ago rhyme intend and forgot about the rice season but rememb it was decent  i was in the neighborhood yesterday and was torn between healthi raw sushi and fri calamari and shrimp appet at sierra gold  told myself to wait until i am marri befor i eat more fri stuff and went to yummi for grub

waitress was nice green ice tea refresh and refil and chirashi was pretti and sprinkl with magic seawe dust  it had tamago salmon eel tuna red snapper and one sneaki sexi yellowtail belli cut  it was fresh tasti healthyish minus the fatti fish i suppos but it is good fat i tell you and fit the need of my hungri tummiit had been awhil sinc i had visit lake las vega and rememb alway want to tri sunset  vine from prior visit the atmospher of the place just seem invit and the food alway smell wonder so when plan a date i decid it would be a nice chang of sceneri and a new experience

i call ahead to make reserv around noon on a saturday  my 1st indic of the even was the phone rang at least 20 time befor someon answer sunset  vinethen silenc  the person confirm they took reserv and took my inform for reserv later than evening

w arriv about 10 minut earli to a rather busi saturday night but the restaur and was mayb half fill at the time  there was no sign or hostess and the few staff which was there didnt make eye contact or wors yet avoid it at all costs

w actual made it out to the patio area befor one of the two waitress inform us that it would be a 20 to 30 minut wait befor we could be seat as she walk by brisk  on her next pass i ask about my reserv which she didnt confirm  but simpli said ohi can seat you now 

we sat on the patio over look lake las vega and the view and breez was perfect  there was a concert about to start and the weather was just right  we order a nice bottl of wine from a pretti extens and wide price rang wine list      we start out with the bacon wrap date which were veri good but just a littl over price in my opinion

 i tri the grill shetland island all natur scottish salmon fillet and she the roast chicken breast picatta  both were good but noth special and we both felt the serv were small and the present was averag  we finish with tiramisu which again was good but average

ov all i was a littl disappoint in the servic food and experi  i wasnt expect fine din or a super romant locat and im glad i wasnt and it would not have deliv  the servic was decent but given a saturday night with a concert on the lake i would think they might staff up a littl more than 2 waitress and a bartend  i didnt even see a food runner so servic was slow although they were work hard to tri and meet the demand  

i serious doubt i will be back again but if i do i hope to rais my rate and have a better experiim no expert on greek food but ive had my share of souvlaki  

i order the steak souvlaki 899 from their lunch special menu from 11 am to 4 pm  it came with a side salad rice pilaf and pita bread  there were four piec of meat skewer along with a side of tzatziki sauc  first off i think i was expect someth els  i was expect more of a souvlaki wrap as this is how i use to have it  so that part was differ for me  it was okay noth spectacular though  i soon learn that most souvlaki serv here are with pita bread and not wrap  so ill have to keep my eye out for that

th husband order the moussaka ground beef eggplant and potato layer and top with bechamel sauc 899  it did sound a lot more appet and onc i read it off the menu he was easili sold  it was okay and he said hes had better

w also down it with a greek soda  blue raspberry

overal yassou greek grill cafe was a decent greek food experi  you go up to the counter and give your order and pay  theyll give you a number and you take a seat and your food will arriv a few minut later  they were pretti busi the weekend we went so they are do okay  it didnt have me scream for more thoughlet get a coupl of thing straight first this is a buffet style chines restaur with a veri afford price tag around 20 for two  that meansdont expect 5 star food  let be honest when was the last time you spent 10 on ani buffet and thought the food was as good as it get that what i thought  but if you know of a place hit me up

china star buffet is locat in north las vega off craig rd  ive been here about 3 time in the last 2 year and each time was becaus one of my team member want to eat here  i take my team out for lunch just as a reward everi onc in awhil  i give them the choic where to eat and they usual pick someth cheap  im not complain that just mean less expens for me  i still think they select someth cheap so that i dont expect more from them lol  anyway china star buffet seem to be their favorit 

this restaur has your basic chines buffet food like wonton egg drop soup sweetsour chicken wannab sushi fish skewer crispi noodl fri rice and even piec of pizza  everyth list happen to be everyth ive tri and the food is just okay  but again i dont expect too much from establish like this  

the servic is a  this might be becaus i have a chines last name  yeah im one of those that flash my id at place like this to get superior servic joke onli  but serious the servic has alway been great from be seat quick drink kept full tabl clean and check provid when need 

overal i cannot give this place no less than 3 star becaus you get what you pay for and the food qualiti is what they strive for  

ps  on my last visit my fortun cooki read learn chines  rosetta stone here i comegood place to have a decent afternoon meal  id like to take a stab at their breakfast the next time i drop by  servic here rocks

a for the food cant realli complain about their
complimentari bread especi the carrot kind
zucchini parmesan
gril garlic sourdough baguette
crispi chicken salad 
spinach and artichok dip
banana chocol muffin
buttermilk spice muffin
clam chowder mayb i shouldv order the cup becaus the bowl was pretti big

but what up with that rotten egg smell in some part of the dine roomdid i think there was an orchard here in vega  nope but luckili a fellow yelper had check in here  

we drove up here on a saturday morn  unfortun we tri to come here friday morn and didnt realiz they werent open  it was fair busi but park was realli easi to get in and out of  you will immedi smell the appl cider donut they have sell near the front entranc  so follow your nose go get some donut  the ladi sell them ask if we want the cinnamon cream chees frost on top  uh yeah  who would turn that down   the frost compliment the flavor donut so well  you get 6 mini donut for 2  pretti good deal to me  at the same time you can buy some of the gilcreas appl cider  this was also pretti great  refresh and delici  

now whi onli a 3 star  well im at an appl orchard right  but there arent ani appl that i can pick and take home  this was strang to me  ive been to mani mani orchard but never one i couldnt pick some appl  they didnt even have ani fresh appl to purchas  bummer  there were plenti of pumpkin to brows  buy  there were also other produc product to pick but i think their price were a bit out of hand   

their check out line consist of 3 regist set up on temporari tabl under tent  there werent ani organ line and way of check out   if you were in a long line peopl would come up from the other side of the orchard and get in front of you  veri frustrat  

i was sad disappoint in the orchard itself  donut were great though  i was on a mission to find anoth snow place sinc mine close down due to reloc what a fluf ice addict to do right i happen to be in this part of town so i stop in after read yelp review 
place is clean and servic is good i would recommend have tabl for 2 rather than larg parti of 4 tabl 
boba is their specialti but i was not at all interest in that  i came here for the fluffi snow
on 3 flavor offer i order the mango with lyche jellyyou get one regular top and one premium toppingso i got strawberri and one saucecondens milk they have a wide select of top to choos from 
it was serv up in a nice rectangular plate that was pictur worthi the small is consider portion enough to share
textur was light but still a bit icey that gave me occasion brain freez flavor was good but not the all natur flavor i cravethis is an ok port of sub locat  my hubbi love port of sub so we eat at them regular all over town whenev he get the crave  some are yucki some fantast but this locat is right down the middl  the staff at this locat are veri hit and miss  some are friend and welcom and some seem bother you are make them work  the store is clean and usual veri well kept  

i am bore and alway get the 1 i call it the italian meat buffet becaus it is load with pepperoni salami capicolla ham and provolon on bread and it is fantast  i am drool just think about it  i am kind of antiveggi so i go with just the meat chees pickl extra mustardmayo spread and all of the season  it is tasty

mi hubbi alway get the 2 which is the turkey ham and chees  he love it and is alway a happi camper afterward  i guess we just know what we like

i like how everyth is slice fresh for your order  the veggi even though i dont eat them all look fresh and much nicer than the veggi at that other chain sub shop  the bread is alway flaki and fresh and tast great  they alway have a huge select of side as well with about 10 chip type cooki and browni  i am just happi with my jalapeño chip though and realli havent tri the other item  my hubbi like their cooki and browni though and he get at least 1 everi time we are there

overal if you want a sandwich quick this is a great locat to grab one and goeven though the same basic type of alcohol are serv in differ bar not all bar are the same some bar have bartend with heavi hand and some dont it can make or break the experience

wel the same idea appli to chain cheap eateri such as subway chipotl and of cours panda express some server have heavi hand and some dont it can make or break the experience

luckili the staff here has veri heavi hand it made my day and broke the button on my slackhad to up the star rate here sure the interior is still the capit of grime citi but the super gyro is tasti and the chicken boti while small in quantiti is still a good dish plus i didnt see ani bare feet this goround serious though the gyro meat is solid moist spici and flavor it def the star in this sammi as usual prepar to wait 10 min for your order call ahead

new tast 
hummus avoid
greek salad sub par

hmmm mayb it should be a 25 star ratepollo loco is usual my go to lunch spot when im in a hurri and want someth relat healthi on the go this was my first time at this particular locat and they were pack at lunch given the long wait and larg amount of volum they seem to serv here i thought the food would be fresher that usual case when there is high turnov my chicken was dri and you could tell it had been sit there a while sinc it had been grill they forgot my salsa so i had to eat them plain which was even harder to toler sinc the chicken was so dri 

servic was friend and id probabl stop by here again if im in the need of a quick lunchi enjoy come here in the middl of the day dure the week to studi or work while use the free wifi  that one of my favorit thing about bdub is the free wifi

il order a 6 pack or dozen boneless wing and just work away  it realli hard not to have a beer or two while studi so ill cave everi onc in a while and grab a blue moon

th staff is alway friend and the atmospher is great for hang out

return factor  75usual this place is over hype and over expens for what it is

but cant say no to a good deal came one tuesday when they have 60 cent wing and special price on draft beer and lunch special 

one thing is make sure you can count yeah made tht mistak when i said i want six buffalo wing bewar theyr dri spice no sauc six medium and six sweet and tangi bbq for some odd reason i thought that was 12 and then afterward i realiz it wasnt damn i felt like an idiot and now i know whi i fail math four time in colleg but anyway

th spice and sauc are delici cant say no to wing but believ me they get you on the fri and ranch for a tini ranch it was 125 for that price id rather bring ranch in my purs 

for four of us 18 wing each a larg fri 2 drink and 3 side of ranch  it came to 58 buck next time i think ill tri wing king especi sinc the servic was so so on the plus side a manag did come by and introduc himself which was refreshwent here for lunch today to meet a colleagu  i order the burger with cheddar chees  jalapeno with a side of fri  the food came out fast and as ordered

th burger was goodnot great  the fri were outstand  the servic was good and my meet went well

overal it was a good experi but for 14 ive had better burgers

wil i return  i usual have busi lunch here becaus of it proxim to the strip  convent centerso i will probabl return  i wouldnt take the famili here for dinnerjust not good enough for the price in my opinionreview for spring restaur week 2012 menu

i went to envi tonight for the last night of restaur week for this spring  the choic were limit which is to be expect for a rw menu  the bread basket was quit nice with slice of french bread white chocol walnut bread and some breadstick 

cours 1  i opt for the butternut squash soup with brown sugar crouton  this was excel  when i took some soup with a crouton i had both a somewhat sweet tast mix with the flavor of the squash  truli inspir think on the part of the chef to come up with this combination

befor cours 2 my server joshua brought me a small tripl dish that had sea salt from differ part of the world  the white was from australia the black from hawaii and the pink was murray river salt  he urg me to tri the salt but to use care becaus it can be overdon  it was fun tri the differ flavor with piec of steak  australian was my favorite

cours 2  of cours i chose the filet mignon  whi get salmon at a steak hous  the steak was anchor on some veri thin slice of sweet potato  the steak was cook correct  i order it black and blue and it almost was  done a bit more than i like becaus it wasnt blue enough

cours 3  there was no choic here but who need one  rw dessert is tripl chocol lava cake  it was outstand  the chocol was rich  it was also bittersweet chocol which was a good choic to keep the overal sweet in check  there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top  great end to the meal

a coupl of thing prevent me from give a higher rate  im not sure if the bread was warm in a microwav but it seem that way  when i decid to have a second slice of that wonder white chocol walnut it had dri quick and had a bit of a crust on it  this doesnt happen with fresh bread unless it microwav for heat  as mention befor the steak was a littl too done for me  final as anoth review note you have to take into account the beauti surround the good servic and the portion size vis à vis the price and envi come up a bit short  i realiz this is an rw menu but when compar it to other place i went dure restaur week envi couldnt compar with some of the others

th servic was excel    joshua was veri knowledg and help  prop to chef michael for stop by the tabl to chat with me and ask for feedback about the meal  

this was a good experi but im not sure if id return  i check the regular menu and im sure my wife would be happier where her choic were more numerthe qualiti of food dure lunch seem to differ great from the food serv dure dinner the chicken teriyaki was veri tough and dri my hot and sour soup was extrem bland and over starchi the sushi roll were 80 rice with small bit of question fresh fish insid my shrimp in lobster sauc had a generous serv of shrimp but the sauc was veri bland they also put my egg roll right in the sauc so it was soggi by the time i got to eat it servic is still bare averag i will not write off ta ta yet just becaus i have enjoy their dish dure dinner time in the pasthhmm im realli lean on give this place a two given the sticki menus the unswept carpet and my soup bowl that had some sort of crumb residu on it but the tempura shrimp and veggi i had were not too bad and i didnt get sick on both time i was drag along here 

their custom base is made up of young famili and on both visit no one didnt seem to mind the mess im assum alot were regular custom by the way everyon interact with the staff  

the servic was on point had no problem issu separ check  the price of the meal was a good valu what i had was pretti decent

so three star sinc my gut surviv not in ani hurri to go back though but will keep this place in mind for cheap eatthere are so mani thing right with hana that one can almost overlook the sordid qualiti and schmaltzi present of their sushi rolls

overrid everi other concept of the restaur is the fact that 95 of the hungri patron at hana are boozehound like myself and this place will cater to the unholi amount of byob that each tabl will bring  what is truli except is that 1 no corkag fee 2 they will chill your white for you in an ice bucket at the tabl 3 if you bring beer they will keep it in their fridg for you and bring you anoth as you continu to dine  4 everyon here relish in this policy

seri i wit a tabl of 5 with 5 bottl of wine and a sixer of some import swill  you could eat a seawe wrap piec of gypsi at this satur point and it would tast like toro

so my gf melissa b and i get there around 630 on a saturday load up with our sav blanc and six of rogu dead guy ale and with full intent of wait for a tabl due to the popular of this restaur and it 50 person max capac  surpris they had 3 tabl open all of them 4top  the hostess inform us that the wait will be 2025 min and im think oh cool those tabl must be reserv  no worri  oh and hey look  there is a two top pay out  well after that coupl leav they scoot over the two top to make it a six top and seat the aforement boozerquintuplet who were right there befor us still wait  okay  no biggi there are still open tables

a parti of three come in  hi  there is no wait  

they get a seat

anoth parti of three stroll in  yep  hi  there is no wait  

there goe our last chanc of a seat for a while and were 25 min into our wait  thank god i brought the beer

a i understand it they will onli seat parti of two at their two top of which they had few and one was be use as an impromptu wine rack for the winosaling or at the sushi bar  i realli have absolut no problem with this polici but i could see how it would piss some peopl off  mayb from an older generat who feel slight by shit like this which is whi im even discuss it  but anyway we eventu we got our perfect littl two top and preced to order edamam and miso  these are two stapl appet for ani japanes restaur  the edamam came out cold which was okay as it is typic serv cool  but i actual prefer my edamam heat and the server never ask for a prefer  hell they even ask you at throwaway joint like ra  sinc we are a cultur of benevol american who are intent on skew everi foreign dish i alway assum that the edamam will be serv warm  either way i was too timid to ask sinc these server seem to be fli around the small restaur with nari a second to spare at the microwav  the miso soup was excel  but if im look for shit to complain about they serv it with that damn goofi overs spoon

when we got our boat of fish my gf and i comment that we would have like a littl extra prep time  i mean come on there need to be distinct transit time between cours  we were onli mild impress with the present  the roll were prep veri sloppili  the yellowtail was absolut lost in the rice  the tempura shrimp was slice so thin that it was destroy by the chopstick  the caterpillar roll had almost no essenc of eel within  the spici tuna was good but noth to rave about as seem to be the trend when discuss hana  we also order the process daikon off of their specialsboard which our server never went over btw and i would high recommend stay away from this unless you curious want to know what littl lisa slurri from the simpson episod the old man and the lisa might have tast like  blech  im sure it was downhom authent but christ that was vile  anyway that was my fault not hanas

i will say that the first time that i came to hana with graham c and yelp famous jerri it was absolut phenomen  i think someth has been lost in translat  back then their roll were much better prepar and the toro was otherworld  perhap it is the hulk melros virul seep into their foundation

i will conclud with a statement about  how i am awar that hana is go for authent which make the curt servic lack of formal like hi how is everyon today i doubt they do that shit at sushi joint in japan and loud bustl atmospher work to a degre  i can howev see that be such a turnoff to those unwil or unawar to put up with it or wors yet interpret it as rude  i person like the fact that place like hana exist as an antithesi to garbag like ra  but everi polar need an equilibrium and for my money time and need for experi noth beat sakanaill be the first to admit that when it come to food i have a littl bit of ocd i live to eat and plan my day accord when my cowork suggest we go to nora wine bar for lunch im on their websit at 930 am plot care what im go to order saliv over the delici list of food i came in with mind made up  the lamb chop 1250 or the grill chicken thigh 950 

we show up and not onli is the menu ridicul a leather menu but it has no descript and it complet differ from the websit menu found here httpwwwnoraswinebarcomlunchpdf  hey nora were in the internet age  keep your websit up to date

i settl on the ribey 17 my cowork got the chicken milanes and the salmon with pasta we start with some bacon wrap date 

date were tasti but cant compet with firefli salmon eat cowork seem happi chicken eat cowork was disappoint the chicken milanes at regular nora is way better and my ribey was fabul i was pretti bum when they show up with dice up ribey but it was legit it was cook mediumrar as request no easi feat on dice meat and i was happi with the microgreen salad despit how heavi on the dill it was a delici fill lunch but for 17 it should be

theyd get 4 star for the tasti ribey but the servic was atroci the restaur was pack and they had 1 waiter ridicul under staf i look forward to tri them again  hope they hire some more staff in the meantim and fix their websit kobe koebay

w havent been to one of these place for a teppan performancem in quit awhil  we last went to one about 3 year ago in boston  prior to that was about 5 year ago in denver  befor that was cleveland about 9 year ago  base on that look for anoth teppan review late in 2012 from either chicago or seattl  i havent decid yet but the fare are good that far out

our chef gabriel did a nice job on both the food and the perform  there was plenti of throw thing in the air spin various implement around flash of fire smolder onion volcano and tidbit toss to the folk around the tabl who tri most success to catch as well as our dog  gabriel also reward folk with a nice shot of sake from his squirt bottl  i actual had enough of these to have a nice sake buzz go  that right  i catch food like a dog better than the other folk at the tabl  a fact im not sure i should be proud of

i order the filet  shrimp  it came with miso soup which was fair and lack veri much tofu a small and plain salad with a pretti mild ginger dress grill shrimp appet and white rice  this is the onli teppan meal i have had that doe not includ fri rice  it is a coupl buck extra  i opt for the fri rice which was pretti good  the shrimp both the appet and those that came with the main cours were tender and tasti  the filet was not as tender but still tasty

overal not a bad deal for the meal  show  i frank have grown a bit weari of these but it is fun to go with kid or teppan virginthough ive known about the exist of this place for quit some time i have alway been hesit to visit bar smith not out of an avers to drink and danc but becaus i know some of the guy who workfrequ this place and some of them havent realli been brief on the whole jetta thing 

oh hi um i hope this doesnt weird you out but i alreadi know you we use to take a class togeth you might not rememb mei was a boy then so uh what new with you

when dottsi z announc that as a conclus to her birthday pub crawl she want to go danc at bar smith i was at first a littl wari but everyon seem so excit at the idea and as the pictur of the pub crawl will show you i was look fuck hawt last night so i figur to hell with parliamentari procedur we had some danc to do

aft navig the diabol labyrinth that are the one way street that surround the place nathan and i show up about twenti minut after everyon els sinc it was after 130 in the am they didnt charg us cover and after i gave the secur the old pleas im work on the driver licens thing dont make a big deal about it eye flutter we were let in without ani hassl 

within thirti second of step insid we spot a man dress in a cardboard and tinfoil robot costum do the robot then and there that i decid this place was at least get three star 

the scene on the rooftop bar was like everi halloween parti in hell or heaven for you overachiev waybufferthanhumanlyreason hipster shook their bon bon with joker nurs and sm fairi as bassdriven boogi pound our ear to near deaf one could even spot adam m over in the corner by the dj danc with himself either that or his partner had wise move out of the way of his cyclon of danc fury

i like to imagin that no matter where i am in the univers adam m at ani time can be found danc in the corner

seri onli phoenix would have rooftop danc in novemb that whi i love this city

at first i felt a littl awkward about danc but when i realiz that dottsi and kevin h were take pictur i knew that there was no go back and even i start shake my groov thing despit be about three or four inch taller than everi one els in the club i tri so veri hard to minim the damag done to the other patron but i just know someon will read this review and say to your friend hey rememb that behemoth chick who gave you that black eye she wrote about it on yelp

though ive been to mani a club last night mark the first time a total stranger walk up to me and ask to take a pictur of me everi day im go to googl tranni danc bar smith rose in mouth until i find that pictur my pose was simpli too good to be kept in someon memori card

th whole night we were there in this case night mean about 45 minut we kept dust off chalk off of each other the wall were liter coat in it surpris i wasnt as annoy with this as i was disappoint i was hope that perhap some sort of hipster robin hood was liter just throw drug at passersbi but it turn out we were just danc too close to the wall oh well

i admit i feel a small tug at my conscienc give this place a threestar review base on 45 minut spent on the rooftop danc and brush mysteri powder off my tit but ala it was enough to win me over and i will definit agre to a second date perhap even a third if i can actual get into the ladi room where ill order some food and drink and write yet anoth one of those use and factual review im so well known forbust out those vintag nike sneaker that you havent worn sinc high school and impress your fellow urban dancer with your dougi the robot the carlton or better yet the worm 

at ani rate bar smith is your destin for your hiphop danc need  

there is absolut noth fanci or pretenti about this venu  it is clear as mud onc you enter this urban night spot  peopl come here to danc groov bounc to whatev lyric rhyme that spit out of those loud rumbl speakers

if you are look to battl there is no shame in do so the vibe here is incred welcom to all level of danc if you see somebodi point and laugh it probabl becaus of your poor fashion sens  not hiphop enough or someth  or those green skinni jean clash with your blue socks

if hiphop isnt your thang head up the stair to the top roof where you can hear the electron beat of hous and tranc music  dont be surpris if there a giant circl form to see who has the most creativ techno moves

for onc a place where you dont have to dress or have the best move to impress  

quick fact 

x 5 cover
x downtown
x free park at the cityscap garag or meter parking
x light rail nearby
x sandwich between 2 other danc venuskye is an interest concept differ room with differ music act playingit seem like it would be a fun place to have dinner but i just couldnt get comfort with my surround and was eager to wrap up dinner and get home as quick as i could 

the food was good but not great the cesar salad was what youd expect the chicken breast that i had was again mediocr i will say that the couscous was a highlight of the meal still everi time the door to our dine room open the music from the adjoin room blast in i think i may have perman ear damag serious the convers had to stop everi time a server walk into our room 

overal skye was 3star decent foodgood serviceoverpow music if i find myself on the west side at dinner time i may tri it again but i wont be go out of my way to eat there anytim sooni use to love the eleph bar we use to go about twice a month at least and now i find myself look for other place the food has been much more inconsist and i keep tri to find someth new to love and onli find like the jambalaya sauc has been differ twice and neither time was the same as the other the thai salad dress no longer has that great ginger flavor i do like their burger and the honey shrimp is good but not as yummi as my jambalaya use to be 

they do have great email special and coupon and i will keep tri hope that it goe back to the way it was the servic is alway great and we usual ask for the same two or three server whenev we go i love the atmospher as well just after a coupl eh meal i am sadwell let me start by say i agre with all of the review i have read alreadybut let me start with one obvious problem i have alway had with buffet style restaurantsth carpetuhhhhhh i mean if these establish are go to have carpet in a public area with kid present and peopl general eat like kidsthen you must pay close attent to the carpet the carpet had a horribl smell at this locationand you realli have to be care not to let it ruin your appetite

i hit this place up becaus of famous teri review httpwwwyelpcombizhotnjuicycrawfishlasvegashrid1kovc8ddqe3xuhdkabbpfw 

 off the strip noncasinoget readi to get messi and sloppi in a sober way

went here with a friend caus he was drunk and hungri yeah i had to babysit

ord 2 pound of crawfish so i can get corn and potato mild spicy and hot and juici flavor mmmmmmmmmmm delish

do expect to get your hand dirti use a spoon to scoop out some of that delici of juic onto your crawfish after peel but expect the servic to be just okay they forgot to get me my bucket of calamari

for the price it aight kinda expens but hey it still good whi 3 star 1 they need to expand and 2 servic need to be good or betterive eaten here a few time and have alway had a solid meal  i feel like this is the same qualiti and level of dine as pin kaow  neither are near as good as lotus of siam   httptinyurlcoml8hr9w 

i particular like the panang curri and the papaya salad here

th restaur is clean and conduc for famili or group  

the servic is attent and helpthe atmospher is a whole lot better than the flamingo locat so this is the place to go if your not do take out  our waitress was forget though  my wife order white wine and she brought out red  i want chang beer and she brought singha  we want 2 glass of water one with no ice and she brought just one glass of water with ice  that took my rate down a star   

we split a papaya salad at level 7 out of 10 spice  it was refresh and spici as heck for me  my wife order the green curri with tofu  she alway alway get green curri  the tofu was deep fri which complement the curri veri well and fri it make sens so the tofu stay togeth in the hot broth    

i got the countri curri with shrimp onli becaus it had the most ingredi list on the menu  that had eggplant mushroom bamboo shoot green bean babi corn basil zucchini and a few other thing in a red curri base  i had that at spice level 5 which was a qualiti burn for me  definit a qualiti thai meal at a reason priceboy i was hungri for lunch i want vietnames sandwich and someplac new so i call dakao to see if they had a vegetarian sandwich check i ask if they accept credit card check i ask if there is a minimum 8 ouchal i want is one vegetarian sandwich the gentleman said that he will process the transact with 1 sandwich for 3 so i jump in my bat mobil and off to dakao i go

onc i arriv it was all wrap and readi to go i did a squeez test and it felt a littl hard with an open mind i proceed back to the offic with my dakao veggi sandwich 

a las back in the offic and a bite i go inde and which i was afraid ofbread was hard and crispi i prefer my bread fresh as in a hint of crisp on the outsid soft and warm in the insid 

although i was disappoint with the not so fresh bread and they didnt have ani hoisin or siracha sauc the insid of the sandwich tast yummi and fresh tofu was saute with veggi soy sauc cilantro carrot daikon and cucumb was organ fresh and crispi 

i will give daikao a chanc and next time will request for a fresh bread by express my last experi to the gentlemanone word overrated

i was definit underwhelm by the food ambianc was nice if you like to watch a shop mall from where your sit we got seat in a nice locat overlook the toilet blue water gondola and the kenneth cole store the interior is nice but noth special if your a foodi and dine out often the servic was averag a small hint of pretens included

w went in expect a nice dinner and order the following
appet saut clam and black mussel with garlic white wine caper and parsley
thi was not good it look like it would be delici when present at our tabl there was a light garlic sauc cover the mussel and clam which was quit good by itself howev the actual shellfish was complet bland and some were too chewi like they cook them too long overal it left a lot to be desired

entre 
1 homemad pasta saut with lobster white wine and babi shrimp in a light tomato sauce
thi dish was pretti averag fare there was one larg lobster claw and a bunch of babi shrimp so they definit didnt skimp on the seafood the sauc was pretti flavor and the noodl were cook well it just wasnt orgasm delici oh and the serv size was bucaesqu which to me isnt a good sign for a suppos fine dine establishment
also it was garnish with a random piec of purpl cabbag and parsley parsley serious i thought this was a classi joint

2 pan sear bread veal loin top with tomato mozzarella and parmigiano serv with saut tomato pasta
thi was my bfs dish he didnt like the veal which was smother in chees but he said the pasta was alright

sinc neither of us are winelov we just order a few cocktail much to our server dismay he was visibl bother by our decis to skip the wine it was funni and odd at the same time oh and a bottl of aqua panna still water is 8 just to let you know in case you were hope for free water 

we skip dessert check was 150 for two meh

th highlight of this place it has the nicest bathroom ive ever seen each stall is it own littl privat room complet with a clear vessel sink and cloth towel they also had a varieti of hand lotion for use in the hallway outsid the bathroomcame to lunch with a bunch of my cowork we made reserv on the patio and although it is right next to a busi intersect and the freeway i realli didnt notic either i realli like their patio and all of  tree provid plenti of shade it was still a littl chilli out when we were here for lunch but they had a fire go in the outdoor fireplac on which made sit outsid much more comfort 

i wasnt veri hungri so i order the dynamit shrimp roll which came with 8 piec of sushi it had a littl bit of a kick to it which i enjoy but i could tast the scallion the rest of the day  the rest of the tabl had salad and sandwich which came in pretti generous portion 

although they were pretti busi servic was beyond slow we had finish eat at least 15 minut but im think it was even longer than that befor they brought us the check this normal wouldnt have bother me if it had been around the dinner hour but most peopl onli have an hour for lunch and want to get in and out

thi place is a bit pricey compar to a lot of the other lunch option around the airpark but it a nice place to go for lunch or drinkive wonder about this place for a while now but have been reluct to go sinc it look anoth bore chain place  i then realiz chain place are preval in las vega restaur makeup

therefor i had to set asid my innat sf disdain for commerci eateri or otherwis id starv or be forc to cook at home
and we cant have either happen 

so i brave my fear and final tri this cozi look place in the middl of nowher that serv pizza panini and pasta

im sadden to say my initi trepid was well found our food turn out to be veri average
th mozzarella in our capres salad wasnt fresh the chees tortellini tast like it came from costco and the pizza sauc was bland
mayb i shouldv cook at home

overal i wont be returnfirst of all this is not the donut hous  that what i was think when the homegirl chose winchel for lunch  come to think of it shes alway choos a pub for lunch 

pros
cheap eat  food here is price pretti good  exampl  8 oz filet for 2199  ton of daili special and lunch special 
wide select for a bar grill and pub
tast  i say you get what you pay for  noth tast realli bad but not excel  again it cheap  
dine room seat or bar seating
video poker if that your cup of tea
plenti of park 

cons
smok  it a bar and pub should be expect  
dark inside
servic is not the best  took a while for our order to be taken even longer for the food to arriv  
wide select of food but not the best place to if your watch your cals

i tri their 8 oz filet and cup of chili  the filet was littl dri and tast close to a ny steak  still got my protein from it so i was happi  the chili here was my highlight it top with onion and also has a littl kick to it i almost got second but figur that it was best that i didnt sinc i was tri to keep the calori a littl low for the day 

overal the 3 star mean that the food here is just okay  dont let the 3 star discourag you  winchel is a good place to hang out with friend and even get a meal in ill probabl be back again to meet the homegirl for lunch  otherwis i just dont see myself go out of my way to eat herethe onli thing that save this from two star was the baba ganoush and gabi  we share a plate of the baba and hummus  cover with veggi and oliv oil  this was better than my actual lunch which was a small greek salad  
uhgreek  it was romain lettuc a few chop red pepper and purpl onion slice withitalian dress  read tast just like wishbon  serious  i was disappoint becaus ive read the review  mayb i just need to tri other stuff  it had a store insid too but i didnt have much time to check the shelves
oh and they push the lemonad big time  neither one of us want  it but they did give us a free cup of it  it was pretti good
il go againi seem to find myself at paradis bakeri an aw lot 

and not just this onewhil not as ubiquit as the dread micki empir pbs are everywhere

i know this becaus i have the pb frequent flyer card and about everi 4th time i goto ani of the pbsi get free coffe and a free muffin 

yay

i met my erstwhil busi partner there for meet last week and realiz that of all the hundr of thousand of time that i have been here i have yet to yelp about itit that much a  part of the background noise

so let rais pb abov the background clutter and give them a onc over

ther are certain thing to like about pb

 free muffin now and then
 free coffe now and then
 the place are all pretti clean
 i alway know where to find the spoon napkin etc pbs are inject mold from the same pattern all of them are reason attract and look almost identicalmuch like the line up in ani miss america pageant
 free wifi and plugin for my computer
 price are decent esp when you factor in the free stuff from  the frequent flyer program

ther are also a coupl of thing that i dont like so veri much

 if i am in the mood for a buffet or a deli i dont mind do the line thing but here it feel like the lunch line in junior highdont know whyth food is general better than junior high was but still perhap it the snood they make all the food prep worker weardont need hair in my soup
 a few more booth for quiet convers wouldnt hurtth sound level at a tabl in the middl of the room can reach roadwork level pretti quickly
 the foodok yesit all reason fresh but that should be a givena minimum standard even at this level the prepar is general haphazard at best and is often stupid flawedeven simpl chang give them fit no onion on my salad pleaseher you go sir an all onion salad have a nice day

al in all the various pbs are an averag dine experiencether are better bakeri better sandwich shop and better coffe housesmayb that their servicecombin all of the abov into one big old averag comfort spot to sit and drink free coffe eat free muffin and read and write my electromailim alway realli hesit to review place that are liter across the street from asu west where i take class and work becaus i worri that my opinion of the busi is skew by it conveni but to hell with parliamentari procedur ive got to russl up some fucs

at the comput lab at west we have a whole drawer of our offic dedic to take out menus it is as expans as it is useless becaus the answer is alway someth asian the onli time weve ever use one of the mani pizza menus we have is when our boss offer to buy us lunch becaus we fear let them know what food we realli like will give them some sort of power over us 

so yesterday john s who is claric boyfriend but was my 1 for the yelp event what with that and i were do our usual lunchtim shuffl pass around menus for chen wok and fuse garden we came across a menu for pho avina we initi saw the word pho and collect agre that pholici sound like a brilliant idea but we were look for takeout and the staff at pholici is so awesom to me on a regular basi that id hate to dis them by walk in give them an order and then loiter outsid while they made it for me 

thank john solv my culinari quandari by mention that he realli like the boba at pho avina the last time i had boba i like was at a quick in the bay almost two year ago the lollicup near my hous which was promot itself as if it shit didnt stink but had weird unpredict hour and alway manag to be out of boba whenev i was realli crave it so pho avina it was

ord was onli a minor travesti the restaur is so tini and compact that the onli place to put their registertakeout counter is right next to the path of the server so in the coupl of minut it took us to place our order we manag to obstruct everi other employe work there thank despit the complaint of my fellow yelper girl i wear heel about 90 percent of the time which make me im easi to spot and never surpris someon turn a corner if they run into me it becaus theyr jerk and want to see if ill say excus me and give away my gender puni nonyelp the mighti jetta is not fool by your nonsense

w spent the fifteen minut wait period out and about the strip mall read the new time and visit the nearbi game store which im go to yelp anyway despit not buy anyth 15 minut isnt a bad wait time for egg noodl soup and boba ive wait longer for a cheezburg and shake oh jesus did i just spell cheeseburg with a z i know i should correct it but i feel compel to leav it there the internet has perman fuck my cognit languag skill 

i order the 41 egg noodl shrimp crab calamari and a coconut boba john order the old school beef and rice noodl pho and a taro boba which he could not describ the flavor of and whenev ask how it was or how it tast kept thrust it in my face and tell me to tri some the sens of urgenc in his voic didnt compel me to want to take that leap

th takeout arrang was both clever conveni and troublesom in our bag were two styrofoam cup of soup littl baggi of warm noodl and a ziploc of cilantro sprout pepper and lime while this made take our lunch back to the offic quick and easi it did caus some problem in unload it content the noodl while still warm were begin to stick to each other and solidifi which made stuf it in the cup of broth rather difficult especi when the noodl didnt separ onc submerg the portion of noodl were relat small and i end up have to put in hand of sprout just to adequ fill the cup which itself was modest at best i know i wouldv gotten more if we had order dinein 

i dont mean to sound like anoth one of those portionobsess american but with work and school and aramark pricegoug at our cafeteria my lunch has to hold me over for the whole day and this didnt work out for me

th food what littl of it was there was actual quit tasti the squid was chewi the crab meat tast real and the two shrimp that were in there were pretti massiv the broth was hand down the best part i could drink a whole bowl of that shit but wont becaus too much sodium is never fun

i realiz waaaaaay after the fact that what we had order was not in fact boba milk tea but in fact snow bubbl milk tea ie frozen boba the pearl were frozen solid and hard to chew and more than one my straw did the mcdonald choke where the content becam so cold they would not submit to the vacuum i was creat eventu i just let it sit on my desk for a half hour where it melt and was then delicious

jok about how lesbian arent as good at suck thing as other peopl has been omit yay selfcensori would have to agre first  foremost with the fli infest theori they realli realli realli need to control it be indoor doesnt stop them at all
last time 2 of us went there it somehow came up to 50 which was insan they are good but 
coleslaw is veri veri plainflavorless i still eat it
th rib are veri good shake  good atmospher good

overal it was a fun time had by all

return factor  60definit love the feel of the place and that they have free wifi and ampl outdoor seat alway a fan of independ coffe shop the iecd chailatt was delish but way overpr as i got about 5 sip out of it due to all the ice it as pricey if not a bit more than starbuck and refil on just coffe was overpr in my mind im use to independ coffe shop that charg hard anyth for just coffe refil while your sit in the shop they have sandwich and other food for lunch too
cool place though check it out if you get a chancthere are day when the line at starbuck is just too long and i need caffin  this place has it

pretti decent coffe and fresh pastries

servic is quickwe made reserv at wing lei sinc it was a conveni locat after see spamalot at the wynn it sound impress what with it be the onli chines restaur in north america to have a michelin star plus the peke duck five cours menu sound delici 

thing got off to a bad start when we had to wait well past our reserv time but the manag did comp our first round of drink as a result when we were final seat we did enjoy the decor of the room but we were realli hungri after have be kept wait and we werent offer appet or amus or anyth to hold us over my husband was especi hangry

two of us opt for the peke duck five cours menu and two of us opt for the chef signatur dinner two of us got the suggest wine pair which was question to begin with sinc i dont think wine general goe with chines food but due to the socal french influenc they claim on the menu i thought mayb they could pull it off not so much  i think for all of us the first cours was our favorit i had the duck menu so my first cours was classic peke roast duck serv with mandarin pancak  you cant go wrong with that dish thing went downhil from there though my second dish was a duck salad which was quit delici but our server didnt bring the wine pair until about 10 minut later the next cours was a duck soup and they forgot to bring the wine period when they final brought it it was the wrong wine and it took yet anoth long wait to final get the right one the fourth and fifth cours were serv togeth and while they were not bad at all they were basic just slop togeth on the plate like a panda express combo bowl for a restaur of this calib i expect much classier present and frank more subtl and refin dish 

i should have known better have just return from taiwan where i was treat to wed banquet food extraordinair that was pictur perfect each and everi time i think ill have to refrain from fine dine chines from now on as there is no way it is go to meet my expect we realli felt cheat after our meal the food was good but the servic was not up to par and the overal experi was definit not worth what we paiddoubl the price doubl the qualiti  no

doubl the price doubl the flavor  nope

doubl the price doubl the win in the casino your kid right

th strip has a sprinkl of veri high end  chines restaur that cater to wealthi game craze visitor from asia  wing lei is unusu in that it focus on american chines food what you expect to find in your usual takeout place rather than asian delicaci  so doe spend 34 for an order of orang beef or walnut prawn make it better than your favorit dive

th food  the walnut prawn were outstand  fresh sweet perfect cook with the right balanc of crispi coat and not over sweet honey cream sauc it not mayo   the orang beef is well cook tender  it is dress in a tangerin yuzu and garlic chili sauc that add a nice acid balanc but lack the flavor punch you expect  final mu shu pork water down week flavor thank to the cabbag releas it water  underwhelming

a beauti dine room  spotless place set  excel but veri restrain servic server serv not converse

speci note  the price on the menu do not adher to the asian belief that that 4 is bad luck and 8 is good luck  befor you get all practic on me i firm believ depend on the rabbit foot if you will but just rememb it didnt work out too well for the rabbit

bi the way the answer to the question  nois the food good  unless your filipino the answer is a resound no  for some reason this place is like catnip for my fiance and her filipino famili  the clear standout that make this place worth the trip are
1 cheesi  no more cheesi than your averag fast food place but this is pinoy cheese
2 chicken joy  this is some damn fine fri chicken  ill give them that
3  it will make your filipino inlaw happy
4  it is a quick and easi way to get some halfway authent filipino food somewhat easili  

give it a shot i would even suggest drive across town for it but you probabl wont need to go twice

p  i plan on copi and past this review into everi jollibe ive ever had the pleasur of be forc in to just so you can see what i am subject to on everi vacat  sigh the thing we do for lovei heard about jollibe by read a harvard busi review case on the compani and was interest to tri it out for myself  i was surpris to discov two locat in vega  i gave the seafood citi locat a try

i knew it was a filipino fast food joint that had food that cater to that demograph  sinc im an whitewash pacif island my tast in food lean more toward a tradit american tast than the islandsso i knew i was in for an adventure

i decid to sampl a littl bit of everyth  i had the shanghai roll 99 cent corn beef sandwich 99 cent french fri and a champ burger  to wash it down i had a bottl of water  sinc i order to eat in the restaur i was issu a number and wait for my order to be deliv  the order came out in two batch sinc it took a while to cook my champ burger

th corn beef sandwich was veri smallabout the size of a slider  it didnt have much flavor to itkind of bland to me

th shanghai roll were veri good  they were tini pinki size roll that had the textur of lumpia  they were pretti good but you didnt get much for 99 cents

th french fri were just ok noth special

th champ burger was a mess  it was veri sloppi with the mayo and ketchup run down the side of the burger  it has a differ tast to iti dont know what it isbut it doesnt tast like a regular burger  i didnt like it at all

th joint was realli busi and had at least 10 peopl in line dure my entir visit which was around 2 pm  that pretti impressive

wil i return  probabl not it wasnt for medidnt i just walk out of the cupcak place and buy a whole 26 dollar worth of cupcak that actual 6 with a special decor my uncl was in the hopsickl up the street and we both have to have sweet so i came on a mission the place is kinda weird to get to it a matter of drive around and look for it in the plaza 
when i walk in it was one guy workingbut onli one custom i decid on a 6 pack halloween style with lil duck that were in costum as my accessori you get to pick differ flavor cupcak differ flavor fill then top then accessori i dont mind it but if there were more peopl there id be hella annoy but here i amuhhhmmmmmmmm let me get red velvet withhhhuhmmmm hmmm vanilno wait uhmbutt creamuh no i dunno
ok when peopl have choic it make it harder believ me from tend bar it suck so of cours what do you do just agre with everyth i final finish after 1520 minut of decid suck ass ok so there goe my precious time  
the cupcak themselv werent bad nice moistur and the fill were great but im not down with the priceso obvious im knock it becaus time are tough not realli into it be so expens we were go to eat here but decid not to at this time sinc we had just ate breakfast and knew where we want to eat lunch and dinnerso this is my first review where we went in talk to the famili own place which they were  so veri nice and friend the ownerson and daughter this place was spotless i wonder if it is like that all the time and not becaus they had just open for the day this place is found by firemensther are so mani fire item around in herefrom the photosfir coat and hatsth deco is so cool like you are in a fire hous eat  we will absolut eat here so i can review the food tooalmost forgot to say that when you sign up for the newslett you receiv a free larg drink when you purchas a subsandwich also promo offersand a free med celebratori subso sarah g our own profession food snob met me for lunch and brought me a sprinkl cupcak  it was in a cute littl box  this is where i get a littl perturb  it has it own box  what a wast  i understand they want it to be cutesi and all but im one of those peopl who want to save the environment
th cupcak was good but not great  i was expect to make a mess in my make me yelp boyshort but didnt  it was the vanilla milk chocol  chocol frost was realli sweet and it was cover in sprinkl duh  the cake was fluffi and moist but not as moist and i like  i guess i was expect to be blown away but it was like the cupcak my sister made for my sobrina 5th birthday parti  with it own freak boxcupcak they seem to be a craze that is not go out of style anytim soon and i know that everyon and their mother couldnt wait for sprinkl to open here in az  

i have yet to visit the shop but i did get to sampl the banana cupcak sinc i was part of the group that celebr halley birthday  it was good  great  no  good  325 per cupcak good  person i dont think so  but it was good and i think that part of the craze is that the cupcak look fantast so cute and color and they come in a varieti of fun flavor httpwwwsprinklescupcakescomflavorshtml

for a special occas i would get sprinkl again and i will go visit the store for sure but am i blown away by sprinkl  not so muchif my best friend were write this sprinkl would get 5 star  he indulg his crave for cupcak so often that they now give him free one  serious he has a problem  just last friday befor he met me for happi hour he call to ask if i want a cupcak becaus he was make a quick stop at sprinkl  i told him to never ask me that again  i dont need to eat a cupcak befor i partak in half price drink and appet some peopl me dont have your metabol  

anyway i found sprinkl to be averag  honest i like the confetti cake mix from the groceri store better  id rather drive up to frys pick me up some betti crocker confetti fun mix and can cream chees frost  the onli problem with that is i end up with 20 cupcak and just me to eat them  soooo sprinkl it is 

i have to add that i googl confetti cake for fun and the imag that pop up remind me of the jack sprat nurseri rhyme 

you know 
jack sprat could eat no fat
hi wife could eat no lean

it was a pictur of a bride and groom get readi to cut the cake  the bride was shock larg compar to the groom  it made me never want to bake confetti cupcak again

back to sprinkl  my friend alway get the plain vanilla cupcak  he never deviat  i enjoy the red velvet and the chocol chocol was the most moist just in case you were wonder but found the vanilla to be a bit dri  if you go go with a friend that way you can tri differ flavor if you end up not be wow by your selective given it a few tri and honest unless someth chang i wont be go back  i alway leav there frustrat and grumpi someth that eat cupcak should never do to you

first their park lot is crazi crazi like a loon it poor design accid are just wait to happen and the closest space which i use as i have arthriti tend to tri and tear the front bumper off my carunless i park further back and then will be hit by anyon entering

th line is usual a bit out of control ive been there both dure a week day earli afternoon and after work around 530  fine i can handl a line for good cupcak and good service

th three time i have been there i have have incred rude associ  i dont if it becaus i dont look richyuppiescottsdal enough but theyr seem nice to the peopl in front and behind me but not to me

they never have the flavor i want even if i follow this littl sheet o flavor day i like the uniqu of the flavor lemon coconut pumpkin chai etc  i would plan my week around this damn flavor sheet and then theyd be out

and now the cupcak ive had cupcak at probabl more than 25 bakeri in at least 10 state  i like cupcak a lot these not worth the ridicul hassl and 350 each the cake alway seem a littl too dri and the last cupcak i got lemon the ice was so sick sweet it made my jaw clench

oh yeah they do take american express but cant be troubl to take discover

al in all the cupcak are ok not bad but theyr certain not mind blow and between the park lot the price and the staff theyd have to be a lot tastier to earn back my busisomehow while attempt to write an updat to my origin incred witti sprinkl review i edit the origin review in error result in the loss of my origin incred witti review worthi of mani ufc  now my 18 fan are stuck with my incred less witti new review

believ it or not i actual had not been to sprinkl in well over a year  unbeliev i know consid i live close by  mayb that say someth  someth along the line of im not realli anxious to pay more for a singl cupcak than it cost me to make a dozen or two at home  but what do you do when it august and the thought of ad ani more heat to the kitchen just wont do and yet you realli need a cupcak  well you go stand in a line 12 deep to pay 14 for 4 cupcakes

 been to sprinkl mayb 4 time now and theyv been pretti consist  i do like their frost but i find the cake to be somewhat dri and flavorless imo  and im alway surpris by the line here  are peopl that much in love with sprinkl or is it that most of the popul is not abl to read the direct on a betti crocker box  im not say sprinkl is bad  it certain has it place in my life for a cupcak fix particular when i know if i make 12 ill eat 12  but i wouldnt go so far as to say im a fan  unless they lower their price to 1 then ill be their biggest fana coupl year ago my mom was a given a gift card to applebe we never got to use it howev becaus there realli is no nearbi applebe where we live in california 

applebe seem to be abund in vega howev and so it seem like the perfect thing to do to bring the gift card on a recent vega trip 

i ate lunch at this applebe locat with my mom and we got the 2 for 20 deal this actual turn out to be quit a good deal becaus it plenti of food you get your pick of an appet to share an two full size entre 

we got the spinach and artichok dip for our appet and for our entre we got the orient chicken salad and the three chees chicken penn 

the appet came out first and was actual best eaten right away the tortilla chip were fresh hot and crispi and match perfect with the pipe hot spinach and artichok dip i was happi to see some big chunk of artichok in there it was good but after awhil i could tast that the dip was a bit on the salti side and this could probabl be attribut to the chees 

mi mom and i split our entre the orient chicken salad turn out to be a lot of food it was veri good the dress was nice and sweet fresh asian green toss in a their orient vinaigrett and top with crispi noodl almond and chicken it was a great salad you can choos to get crispi chicken or grill and we chose grill 

the three chees chicken penn turn out to be my least favorit of all the entre it was all pasta and bare ani chicken the chicken was just on top and there realli wasnt a lot of chees it suppos to have mozzarella provolon and parmesan along with bruschetta fresh basil and alfredo sauc i dont think the ratio of the top and the chicken with the pasta was too well done the whole pasta seem dri 

anyway it was an ok experi here im glad we final got to use the gift card and it was plenti of food it last us for both lunch and dinnersteve grillhous was aok

aft a long hot trip from california i final made it into phoenix while cruis the downtown area steve was one of the first place i saw so i decid to check it out 

i order the blacken chicken sandwich while my girlfriend order the cajun pasta with chicken the wait staff was nice and the food came out quick i enjoy my blacken chicken howev the chicken wasnt realli blacken it was just kinda grill lol i didnt mind though the honey mustard tast good the cajun pasta howev was a littl too spici for my flavor i know it cajun style but it left such a hot aftertast in my mouth that it felt a bit much 

i can see steve be a cool littl spot to grab a burger from everi now and then if i was from the phx area right around the corner from the stadium and arena got nice outdoor seat that kept cool by overhead sprinkler i give it a solid 3 starsteve is hit or miss with the servic just know that go in vinni is great the other meh the kitchen take forev squint from the sandlot style right there ive gone time where we were the onli tabl in the whole joint and it still take forev and then the burger were over cook blegh whatev  

i do like the burger from here when they are cook med rare like i like em cowboy burger drool actual all the food ive had here has been pretti tasti the beer select is pretti good and the vibe is kickin they usual have live jam on the patio on the weekendfor me everi cupcak will forev be compar to the cupcak at parti favor in brooklin mass  and these cupcak fall terribl short of that bar

i was drive by and thought to myself that a cupcak would make a great dessert so i went in  the store itself is kind of empti with onli a few lone look cupcak select  i chose the bliss a a light caramel cake top with creami peanut butter frost  im a huge pb fan and i will eat anyth with it  i will admit i was dismay they had no chocol and pb option  the cake itself was veri veri dri could it be becaus the cupcak sit out and are not in a case  im not sure  and the ice was just ok  the pb cupcak at parti favor actual have whole pb cup in the bottom of them as well as pb in the cake part  in comparison these were rudimentari and im sure that i could make someth similar in my own kitchen  

overal i was not impress  in fact i was so disappoint in the cake portion that i stop eat it just ate the frost and toss the remain cake part in the garbag  i may go back and tri anoth flavor but to be honest they are rather uninspir  but it definit not the first place i would run to if i want a cupcaki was crave someth basic and simpl noth fanci someth as good and delish as old fashion roll oat with a hint of honey and soy milk breakfast of champion imo  warm good in my tumtum 

planet daili was the spot our group of gal chose after walkin endless in vega 

on to the mark for the good bad and ugli 

good 

 seat almost immedi with a group of 6 

 my ahi tuna salad was delish not over season and it wasnt dous with so much dress that you could bare tast the delic flavor of the veggi and ahi tuna 

 free mini heinz ketchup bottl  well at least the girl figur it was free cute memorabilia 

 live and flat screen tvs are seen throughout a good place to catch a game and mayb grab a few dranks

bad

 menu suffer from a case of mistaken ident are we american asian italian or mexican 

 i love option but look at the menu made me crave for a broad rang of thing from oatmeal to wonton soup  oy  im indecis enough as it is whi must you tortur me planet daili  whi 

ugly

 an extens menu come with a ridicul price basic breakfast food item you can get from denni is twice the cost here no bueno

overal i give this place a c aka meh sinc i enjoy my meal 

would i go back  it open 24 hoursso maaayb under the influenc everyth tend to get a boost in rate when im typsi  oo this was one of the restaur insid the planet hollywood hotel in las vega  it a nice option sinc they have such a vast menu  they also offer a coupl of special includ all you can eat pancak in the morn and a prime rib special in the even  unfortun i miss out on both

anyway the food itself was ok  noth to write home about  although as i mention befor the choic are pretti good  open earli and late is a big plus be in vega  costwis i suppos it could have been a littl less expens be in vega for a diner but not too bad  

servic was just ok as well  although our server came out right away when we sat down after the food came out it took a while to track him down when we need someth  

overal pretti ok though

keep on yelpnswitch is a standard three star i love love love fez and dont want to diss the sistabut the food here is pretti bland they could definit updat their menu at first it seem decent then you realiz the item are the same just prepar in differ way each time i have been here the staff has been inattent at best the hummus did not even come close to the delici fez serv up the french dip was just ok and came out cold the gallett i tri was like a turkey pot pie  decent but noth to rave about  mayb it is not fair to compar to fez mayb i had too high of expectationsthey do serv delici sangria and they have a great happi hour 241 caipirinha and sangria so rare to have sangria on happi hour these day i will give switch anoth chanc mayb i just came on a few off nightswitch was pretti good noth negat dure my experi but noth super amaz either  everyth was good the patio was cute our waiter was nice realli aok  but not somewher i would say let go to switch im crave it 

here are my like i have no dislikes
 the special cant beat the price 
 the mac  cheese
 our waiter dusty
 patio
 heater

al in all i dig it if someon want to go here id be up for it also i would recommend it as a place to go if your want to eat a bit later sinc their kitchen is open til midnightishrestaur that have pizza and bistro togeth in the name make me wonder about the level of ego float around

but i thought id tri it sinc i realli like the origin red devil in phoenix

what disappoint me immedi is that while it a modern and hip look littl  okay it a bistro i get it  you dont enjoy the place immedi  as you enter the door you run right into a wallof cash regist   so unless you studi the menu onlin and figur out what you want befor you go in you feel like your hold up the line  i can feel those feet tap and loud sigh behind me as i type  i feel pressur into order the first thing my eye set on  quick eeni meeni miney moe

th seat nazi have a littl fit if you ask to sit and look at the menu  what a concept look over the menu in comfort  wow

of cours i did it anyway

sham on me

th food is general good i tri a littl of the pizza  thin crust was appropri crunchi top pipe hot  not over oili  basic good pizza  but noth that ran in my mind as the best or interest twist

i had the meatbal sub  big juici light meatbal a good tangi sauc stuf in a nice rustic crusti bread that you know is fresh  huge  i could onli eat half

pric run on averag 810  drink are separ  the server are nice and quick to take plate off the tabl  i guess you onli get the mean factor when it come to the order part of the restaur  there a bar area with big screen but i cant imagin too mani peopl sit there watch a game it a littl smallish

i wouldnt mind go again if im in the area and feel like pizza but it not a place that ill have daydream about and crave for253 

i realli want to love this place 

good morn veteran day yahoo day off for teacher my boyfriend suggest we get breakfast to celebr not have to wake up at 5am he suggest some of our usual favorit kiss the cook black bear diner etc but i have realli been slack on my yelp and want to tri someth new and delici i consult my friend at yelp and was so excit to find what i thought would be anoth hidden gem onli a few mile from our place 

we got there around 1045 and the place was pack this made us veri excit becaus usual a pack place  solid food solid servic we had a tini wait and had a great littl booth spot after about 5 minut our serverfor the sake of kind let call her grouchi girlflew over and liter threw menus at us not cool she then came back for our drink order and seem great putout by our request for water with our coffe sorri for that extra 36 second we request from you grouchi girl 

the menu look great i love the simpl idea of creat your own omelet i had an egg white omelet with chicken had never done this befor and love it tomato spinach onion avocado the omelet come with all kind of greasi starchi good which i turn down for a bowl of fruit grouchi girl clear did not like this choic my boyfriend went with the waffl breakfast with bacon and scrambl egg he enjoy the waffl and bacon but the egg realli did look bizarr 

look around the room i notic a lot of biscuit and gravymayb this is where we went wrong but either way i doubt we will returnhonest i live right around the corner from this place i have been eat here sinc high school and now im graduat colleg this is the breakfast spot i get the omelet or the breakfast burrito and they usual come with pancak 

the place is alway pack but it never a long wait for a tabl you get a great deal for your money the portion size is definit worth it and usual turn into two meal 

this was a 45 star review up until this point and now they onli get 3 from me 

the rude waitress thing is a problem for me these high school girl with their rat up hair and overdon makeup at 6 am need an attitud check more often than not i get a snooti curt waitress who resent bring me a clean fork or a fresh pot of coffe 

i dont care if there is gum under the tabl that the food is greasi or that the blueberri pancak syrup is realli color sugar water all i want is a polit waitstaff that doesnt roll their eye at me 

mike and rhonda i love you and it noth person but give me a better waitress and ill give you a better reviewamanda b organ a uye for dim sum here today  they do dim sum from a menu instead of cart and it work realli well  they also have a pictur menu to look at with mani of the item on it so folk like me can have a better idea what to order just by pick the pictur of stuff they like on a prior trip  we were pretti much the onli folk there for quit a while and we had the full attent of the staff  not all of the staff is fluent in english but i can onli recal that be a problem with the tea  i like my choic a bit better this time experi help and marian h was help me with sauc pair as there were sever to choos from

i almost gave them a 4 but for the restroom  the fixtur had a lot of corros around them and in general the restroom show a lot of wear  i flush the urin and was wash my hand and it seem like the run water was veri loud i look over at the urin and the valv had stuck and the place was inde flood  i beat on the valv with my fist until it rock back but by that time the floor was quit deep in water  i mention it to the hostess and they had someon in there with a mop quickly

i would definit go back here again      this review is for the china chan daili buffet      

drop in here today with norm r  mike c to tri the new buffet they have go  there were onli 19 item with all of it good but noth outstand  china garden at 19th av  bell rd get higher rate with a tini select like this by serv except food  also empti unus tray lay there in the serv tabl were a minus  solut  bring out more food items

restaur comfort was ok  it was inexpens at 599decent but not even close to 5 stars

they do well with their sandwich chicken parm sammich was pretti darn good and okay with the pasta dish although their price exceed their quality

do not bother with the pizza  at least not the slice at lunch time  theyr precook and reheat poor creat a crust that is hard and that you wish was flavorless and congeal the chees greas up quit nastily

i will credit that even dure busi lunch time theyv been abl to accomod a dozen or so peopl in a singl parti fair effici  on one occais they put up quit a fight on the split of check but had no choic when most peopl had to pay by card but on anoth occais they split check with nari a gripeaverag averag averag   had a few beer and tri sever other  all were fine but seem water down a bit

had a few app and they were standard issu  meh

id rather go here than an oliv garden i guess that the best way to sum up how i feel about this placevacat time spent by a trip to see the famili is general rife with compromis after fail to produc an agreement on anyth we all realli want we end up at the somewhat unfortun name bjs brewhouse

i half expect to see gaggl of teenag boy and tweenag girl of rough the same matur level stifl giggl about what bj might stand for but did not the other half expect the food to be disappoint and for me to be alreadi long for some good szechuan befor id been in arizona 2 hour and pleasant did not experi that either standard chain decor standard chain servic standard ratio of oper to nonoper men room stall nonzero

w opt for the stealth 20 email special of a share medium pizza ani specialti or number of top a share pizooki dessert and individu soup or salad which i would strong recommend sinc normal a specialti pizza itself is 20

the starter minestron with a bit of chees italian adequ unremarkable
th pizza a paradox chicagostyl southwestern like a chain boutiqu version of pizza hut solid crust great by seattl standard low
th dessert a veri thin peanut butter among the 5 varieti cooki in a pancakes tin top with vanilla ice cream i was more preoccupi with whether madam ks pizza brothel er bistro in seattl copi the scream orgasm from them or viceversa and think they would have been better off to copi bjs pizza than the experi of the sweet cookie

th verdict for optim ani particular aspect one could do better elsewher but the pizza is quit good among most forgett accompani chain are general compromis candid and in that vein bjs brewhous perform the jobdisclaim alert  i dont eat fruit i cant eat fruit  so my review is sole base on the cleanli of berri blendz the servic and my power protein smoothie

aft a pretti good workout at gold with terri r we end up come here for our post workout  we were hope befor come in that they had someth with whey in it and they did  berri blendz has their power protein which consist of a bunch of fruit and 40 gram of whey  this was perfect minus the fruit of cours  i end up substitut the fruit with nonfat yogurt  i order a medium and got what look like a larg  my smoothi had an okay not great tast to it  bottom line i wasnt look for tast anyway i just need someth to assist with recoveri after hit the gym hard  

blendz itself was clean when we visit them and the servic was okay one plus with this place is that they have a small sofa or loveseat where we were abl to have our postworkout treat and chill at the same time 

power protein  httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosselectzq0nw4rdibhjhbwegykgequseridy3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq

not mine this would kill me  httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosselect0eqq2rzx7is62fnddfukauseridy3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbq

not a fork  httpwwwyelpcomuserlocalphotosuseridy3fcl4bly0ellkb0sdpnbqi bet you suburbanit of america most bore citi love pay top dollar to get just decent mexican food when it come to my search for great mexican food i just cant catch a break outsid of the barrio 

i order the killer burrito beef bean guac and sour cream possibl a bit of chees the tortilla are made fresh from scratch and tast amaz their beef tast exact like it would from someon home the salsa was noth to get excit over but the fresh hot chip were great

so your probabl wonder whi i gave this two stars

th price are a joke if you dont believ me laugh at this


ani plain burrito carn asada chicken etc is 6 but if you dont like your plain itll cost ya

th horchata cost 275 and it the fountain drink horchata not the real stuff

a quesadilla with carn asada sour cream and guac come out to 1100 yeah i made that face too

mi burrito was 750 

no portion are not huge theyr the same as everi other place so in realiti your pay up to doubl the price for your meal just think of that quesadilla and your certain not get the qualiti to match but doe mesa realli have an alternive onli been here to see band play for that purpos it seem to be a bit of an awkward setup i would feel quit awkward tri to play a show here it much easier be a patron 

it is inde small and divey as a venu and just divey as a bar everi drink was serv in plastic cup when ive gone  that might chang on differ night in the back they had a golden tee which i jam my finger on almost 2 year ago and it still fuck up and which kept short out in the middl of the game irrit 

it can be a pain to get in and out of becaus you have to make your way through cloud of smoke and peopl tri to watch the band in order to belli up to the bar also depend on how busi it is  it can take awhil to get served

if your go to see the band you may want to note that the sound mix isnt the best also the acoust in the place arent veri good either i do kinda like that it not the easiest place to find i also like that it a weird setup this place would rank pretti low on my list of favor place to go see a band play but i wouldnt necessarili avoid see a band i like just becaus they are play herefor as much as i love pizza california pizza kitchen somehow miss the mark with me  it just lack that someth that make me want to keep come back as a chain

when date guy and i arriv we were warm greet by the staff and we request a booth  it was sunday night and it was a rather quiet low key even so the restaur was not except busi  for whatev reason we were seat in a huge booth that was meant for 6 peopl  there were sever other open booth that were meant for a normal parti of 2  whi were we sat at the booth of 6 no idea  go figure

anyway we had a foccacia appet and it was amaz  love it  best thing ever  but patrick mojito wasnt quit up to par so we ask the server and she fix it  i guess there was hard ani mint in it and it tast weird  i hard drink but i will take his word for it

anyway i got the santa fe chicken pizza and it was fine i dont rememb what patrick got but he was happi with his food as well  we pass on dessert and stuck around for a bit

i realli like our server as she was profession and handl herself wonder but servic was kind of slow i dont know if they were short staf but at one point i was die of thirst and out of pop so i walk to the bar to get a new drink and was told that one would be out in a second  it was but i think the poor girl was overwhelmed

anyway i would return to eat here no problem not a bad experiwhile stay at orlean to earn mandatori continu legal educ credit at a threeday seminar on manag use of forc dian and i sampl the courtyard cafe for the first time  not know their portion size i order louisiana style gumbo and hot roast beef  i quick learn that the gumbo was a meal in itself  serv in a giant bowl this tasti jumbos soup was down and dirti slow cook and chockful of spici sausag cut of chicken celeri and rice bob in the current of a thick brown roux  but not a speck of seafood was in sight  

a dinner salad was grace by excel hearti french dress over bright red cherri tomato two type of green cucumb and crouton  numer cut of thin hot roast beef slather in earthi brown gravi were good and sauci although the gravytop mash potato accompani the meat were a bit lumpi  dian enjoy her fish and chip which were ampl and fair standard other than be pair with a small corn on the cob    

servic was friend and veri good except that a small paper contain fill with mayonnais was mistaken present by our server instead of request butter  we were both quit full and satisfi when we left our table

312 stari was crave sushi so my sweetheart said let go have sushi so we decid to go to sushi twister sinc he has been befor we usual go to oyshi sushi on our side of town which never disappoint with the good qualiti and service

w decid on the ayc so we could get our fill of sushi in to satisfi our cravings

mi man had been crave a roll they have that is wrap in a jalapeno wrapper and deep fri that he alway talk about be so good well he order it which is now list on the appet section of the menu and it was not anyth like he rememb the way he describ it and the way it tast was noth like he had describ or had befor the size was tini not a full size roll as befor so that was a let down and it was so small i could not even sampl it

her are some of the roll that we order 
boulder crunchi roll
spid roll
scream for vengeanc roll
ecstasi roll
shrimp tempura roll
philadelphia roll
dead dragon roll
angri ninja roll

for some reason the cucumb in my roll caus a burn tast as if it was char broil or blacken so i ask them to omit ani cucumb from my futur rolls

th roll were ok noth that give me the oral mouth orgasm that oyshi give me on everi visit the flavor was just not there as i was expect or had hope for

thi was across town quit a drive to tri a sushi joint that i had never been to howev we are spontan like that my sweetheart said the sushi was good in last visit howev it seem they have chang and the roll that he like are just not what they onc were

ok so we gave it a shot and it disappoint unfortun and i am surpris becaus the review and star rate on yelp are pretti good so

i do have to say the servic was veri good we sat at the bar and they had our roll whip up in a jiffi and they kept up on our drink refiluse to be a 24 hour cafe  now it limit hour  food is okay but it on the strip and cheapi love innout but this is the first time ive got to give them onli 3 star  i recent came to this locat and ordered

french fri anim style 350
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosinnoutburgertempeselectmocfgfjgvcqjyx4rr7vqmocfgfjgvcqjyx4rr7vq

smal soda 140

the cheeseburg was perfecthad all of the flavor that ive come to love about innout  the anim fri on the other hand were terriblethey were cold and chewi  unbeliev becaus they cook it freshthey mustv left this order on the counter while they finish by burger instead of give me a fresh order of anim fri  it was a littl disappoint becaus i normal have a 4 or 5 star experi at an innout

oh well mayb i caught them on a bad day  

return factor  60i love sushi and im not the toughest critic when it come to sushi but i consid sushi broker just averag the food is fine ive never been overwhelm by how fresh and delici it tast but ive never been sick from it either

i go to sushi broker for the conveni factor they are locat on scottsdal rd veri close to the 101 and the atmospher  the servic is just ok as well but they must be do someth right becaus the place was pack when i went in for dinner on monday night

i took my boyfriend sister she is 16 and i figur the music they play would be right up her alley  i was right  she knew the word to everi song that blast through the restaur  we both had miso soup and we share seawe salad and some roll includ spici yellowtail eel and cucumb scallop and salmon skin  we didnt order the lollipop roll but that is my favorit specialti roll on the menu  everyth was fine consist fine  

we miss happi hour but ive been in the past and i like happi hour price much better than the 60 i drop there without alcohol on monday  ill continu go to sushi broker for the fun atmospher and conveni locat  peopl watch is fun too and with big screen all around i guess you could go to watch a big game on tv as well  just set your expect accord and youll be finei hate to say this but after my experi at eddi vs last night i think theyv gone down hill  there was a lot of miscommun  here why

upon walk in we were pleas to see that they still offer all night happi hour on sunday and monday  their happi hour  12 off most appet and i believ drink special too  the hostess ask us for our name and we respond that we didnt have a  reserv that we were just go to eat and drink in the bar area she was not the friendliest and just nod  side note  no reserv was need as the restaur was not busy

so we sat in the bar area and when the waiter came to take our order we were a group of 4 we place sever appet order right off the bat and said that would be good to start and wed add more to the order in a bit  we also order drink  i specif order my new favorit black cherri effen vodka with soda

so when the waiter came back with the news that they were out of black cherri effen and didnt carri it anymor i was a littl disappoint  no big deal though i went with the 3 oliv cherri vodka instead with soda  

waiter come back with the drink and mine  look like cherri coke  i tast it and sure enough hes given me a cherri vodka with diet coke  no clue where that came from but he took it back and brought me final what i order  in the meantim he came over and ask if we were readi to order when we ask if the first round would be out soon he said he didnt put it in yet as he did not think we were serious when we put the first round in  ugh  not funni when your with 2 veri hungri men 

we end up order more and were all hungri for the first round of scallop ahi tuna mix greenpeargoat chees salad corn and crab chowder and crab cake  in the meantim we were given bread and butter but ala no silverwar app plate or napkin no big deal  we got those within a coupl of minut  

we were so happi with the first round except for the soup which we all agre tast like water and potato so we sent it back that we decid to order more anoth scallop anoth ahi tuna a tuna tartar broil oyster with a spinach and artichok fondu and a steak  this time it took an extrem long time for our food to arriv and when it did the scallop were present total differ and the ahi was overcook  also the waiter thought we order raw oyster and not the broil ones

at that point we were done  no need to attempt to correct the order  the soup and ahi were remov from the bill as they shouldv been  we did send them back  

i have to say asid from the compani this meal was just mediocr  ive had great meal at eddi vs in the past and hope this was just an off even but i will not be run back anytim in the near future

sorri eddi v  onli 3 star this timeour meal was a comedi of error and even with happi hour all night not worth the i like the burger tapa concept thing they have go but the entir time i was here as i sat on the patio i laugh at the under construct sign of delux under plain view smack dab across the street on scottsdal road

so of cours dure my meal i couldnt help but draw comparison to delux  grant it probabl would have happen anyway but regardless i found the constant remind amus  

mi friend maya brought me and some outoftown friend who oo and aah over the place  slider are so trendi i exclaim to the group as we bask in the stench of the scottsdal canal from the patio and watch as sceney passersbi and diner enjoy the saturday afternoon  i immedi felt like hurl not sure if it was over the stench the halfjok insipid exclam i made or the poseurish crowd  inclus of a blond scottsdal broad in a babi blue jumpsuit with match blue flip flop we saw that blue smurf atroc later at giligin naturally

back to stax  the 3 oz burger themselv are goodnot excel and not bad either  they offer more varieti in burger than delux  salmon turkey ostrich veggi etc  the meat was cook well done on one and a littl too char on anoth  the buffalo  the highlight here are the top and customiz add this add that option incl chees saut mushroom caramel onion tot sweet potato fri which open up a number of possibl  i realli like the top on the buffalo  muenster chees peach bbq sauc pickl shallot and an onion ring

a friend ask our server how mani to order to equal a typic hamburg and her answer was 25 so basic two or three   ahh there the rub  the slider are 4  5  order three will mean you spend 12  15  yike  definit more expens than an oftcriticizedasexpens delux

servic here was solid if a bit slow to start  my friend margarita came out veri quick but the diet coke i order took about 10 minutes

i would come here again if for onli the dip sauc garlic aioli pesto chipotl  crap they were all excelif youv been to this locat when it was old chicago it hasnt chang much

absolut same decor same uber select of beer on tap and in the bottl  they even play bad 90s rock too loud on the jukebox in the bar still i dont even think they chang the menuyep they still serv up their signatur italian nachos

for as collegey sport fan as it kind of seem to be target for it a pretti normal crowd like realli normal forgett normal and i dont mean that in a crappi way i use to live right down the way and the roommat and i would head up for a beer or two reason price bar food mushroom swiss burger pizza calzon appet decent salad i hate to compar it to an applebe or friday but i guess if i had to i would but you dont leav with that corpor whore out  feeling

th bar seat area is plenti it a upbeat atmospher with consist decenttogood servic it the kind of place you could even take your dad or your cowork too and when i final say fuck it to if it too loud your too old and ask the server to turn down the juke box they doalthough i am german i do not like all german food and rare have i ever had ani item in a german restaur that can even approach my oma cook read im a tough custom hubbi want to tri someplac new for lunch today and hand me the recent publish new time best of phoenix after thumb through the food section and not realli see anyth that total jump out at me i suggest black forest mill their best german restaur recipi 

the bar had a few rowdi in it at 300 in the afternoon even a few in lederhosen we were almost the onli one in the dine room so im not sure whi our servic was so slow we order beer on tap hubbi dunkel dark beer was smooth and tasti i had the hefeweisen and ive had better we order a pretzel as an app and it came hot with a hot and yummi beerchees dip sauc it was not ani differ than the pretzel we get at rosi mccaffrey or pretti much anywher els besid the old heidelberg bakeri i realli expect someth housemad rather than from the freezer

our lunch were both realli hearti i had the wiener schnitzel veal patti with lemon garnish and realli good and crispi french fri which were definit closer to pomm frite than regular fri hubbi had the sausag sampler which is realli more sausag than ani human should eat in one sit they did not bring out the same varieti they had advertis on the menu which disappoint me sinc what was miss was one of my childhood favorit weisswurst the knackwurst was mighti tasti howev his side were just adequ boil potato and caraway laden sauerkraut they brought out a basket of bread which contain seedless rye and pumpernickel ive had better rye but the pumpernickel was quit tasty

al in all it was just ok well keep look for a german restaur that make someth that realli remind me of homewander around pari aimless might sound hopeless romant  unless you are in vega and are so hungri you want to stab someon in the eye  of cours all the buffet and restaur have line longer than frys on black friday morn  i was furious  for food  

we kept walk farther and farther until we reach balli  final we reach a dark hidden restaur corner  steakhous or pasta  steakhous or pasta  they both look rather pack so we just took a shot in the dark  pasta  it look classi and it was most full of crusti old peopl who look like money bag and hair piec  the best part is that they were offer a prefix for 25  a bunch of food and a glass of wine and we dont have to pay 15 just for a measli sammich like the rest of the strip

w were quick seat and our waiter was pretti funni but also gangsterish  i didnt know if i shouldnt laugh at his joke or if id get stab if i didnt anyway  i went with the starter of salad and opt for the angel hair pasta with white wine  the other half went with the soup and the meat sauc rigatoni with red wine  both were good but didnt make a last impress  then a bowl of bread came out  this was definit the hit of the night  the whole larg ensembl of cheesi roll crisp flatbread and french bread were demolish  next the starter came  the salad was light toss in vinagrett and the soup was tomatoey and quit fine pure  

the pasta was definit not al dent but a littl on the too soft side  the angel hair marinara was pretti potent so if you have acid reflux problem youll want to steer clear  the rigatoni was good but i felt like ive had better meat sauc pasta at home  

the dessert was better look than it tast and they ran out of the tiramisu which made me quit sad  all in all the ambianc made up for where the food was lack and so did the servic  the food wasnt disgust and if your hungri youll definit leav happi and full072711

httpwwwyelpcombizphotosqmnggd9gsqdjalaquj4dqselectmcn1eouktlcsh6wp7easgwi onli ever seem to end up at the crack egg with a coupon in hand the breakfast are alway solid not my favorit in town but they have quit a bit of varieti and it all pretti good 

i have tri a number of thing over the year and i tend to prefer their savori to sweet coffe cake isnt my thing so despit all the rave i have never order it more than onc the omelet usual draw my attent and they are good and cook to order servic is friend but the restaur get pretti busi so be prepar to wait or arriv earli on weekends

non of the dish have stood out over the year but if your look for a basic breakfast stop this is as good a place as ani just make sure you have a couponim feel bad about the review that came befor mine but my honest review is that this place is just meh

i was there last night which was a tuesday for a meet  we had some drink and i order dinner servic was decent not great  food was the same  i had a bean burrito with a side of guac  it was fine  some of the other at the tabl took advantag of their dollar taco menu  i think it part of happi hour that you can get your choic of chicken or steak taco for 1 buck each  not bad

i didnt start with the chip and salsa becaus when i do that i can never stop but from experi i know their chip and salsa are pretti good  

go for drink especi if your crave corona with some chip and salsa  the atmospher is fine and it work for small group too  it a decent chain restaur that is pretti consist in give you standard mexican fare  go with just meh expect and youll be finesu vino is the first and onli wineri in scottsdal  i like to come by everi onc in a while to sampl some of their wine they often have a 15 deal on groupon and whenev i see it ill buy one or two it make for a nice start to the night with a date in old town scottsdal  the wine is good the staff is alway veri friend but the scene is just kind of ok  what can su vino do to improv chang their locat they are in a weird part of old town that doesnt see much foot traffic so it can be dead some nights

mi experi has been i go with a date there is some other event go on rehears dinner or bachelorett parti there may or may not be a few other coupl at the bar and the bartend will keep you compani with a friend convers ill be honest i wont go here when i dont have a gorupon coupon but when they go on sale ill be sure to grab a coupl and i suggest you do the same for 15 you can get about 35 worth of wine and app you get two wine tast 5 wine each and one appet to split i recommend either the antipasto or the chees dish as both are veri good15 for the interior
55 for the food
averag 3 star seem a littl unfair becaus i love the food that i got here the law of small number suck and that math for you

okay so upon walk in you can see clear that it is just a hole in the wall kind of restaur i will go as far as say that if i were to sit down and eat here it is like eat in the bathroom of a gas station im truli sorri if i just ruin your appetit instead i ask for a togo order of a papaya salad and a red curri with tofu the papaya salad was extrem fresh becaus the veget were veri nice and crunchi love it similar the red curri had just the right amount of viscos while be flavor and delici and full of fresh ingredi so good that i ate half the contain without even realiz it 

i plan on come back for more as im now a  huge fan of the food hereedit 33008
ok im downgrad to 3 star  now c4 is still a good place but recent visit have shown the restroom to be consist disast  water overflow with caution sign and bar of soap and lack of paper towel  yuck 

mi last visit on a friday night the restaur ran out of macaroni when i was look forward to the chorizo mac and chees  i had to settl for a shrimp quesadilla which was ok but noth near the delici of the mac and cheese


review  21608

mi huge elton john glass are off to ben his cute dog and his team at c4 and the clarendon hotel im impress with how quick c4 underw chang to the restaur and menu  

ill keep this quick becaus erica awesom review cover it all

th chorizo mac and chees was veri delici im all about all thing chees and love a bit of spice so this was an obvious choic when i saw it on the menu it was also onli 7 but should you be in a sandwich or burger mood the california club with the usual fix and chipotl mayo also deliv for my friend bobo   the potato wedg that came with it were hugeim talk quarter of potato here

our parti of 10 got dramat improv servic from our last experi and onli toward the end did i tip off the server that we were guest of ben from yelp   yes one person got their appet tortilla soupfor dessert  but other than that our server was gracious chatti and demonstr knowledg of the new menu  the best part of the servic was after dinner when ben and his cute dog ask us how dinner was and we gave him our feedback

th best part of the new c4 besid the chorizo mac and cheese
 a stun rooftop bar and cool happi hour promot with differ dj and comfi patio furnitur to watch the glitter central phoenix skylin and relax in a fab set reminisc of the standard hotel in la  
 dessert the flourless mexican chocol cake was incred with the flavor of both spice and cocoa that left us all want more  the key lime cheesecak had great hint of lime zest throughout

th warm santa fe orang paint on the wall and new southwesternn art in the glass case suggest a new direct for the restaur  one that im pleas with and hope continu to be improv upon  

35 star for food and servic and 5 star for effort by management

origin review  januari 2008

i feel like im be generous with the twostar rate after come here a few time for drink i was wait for a dine experi to actual rate the place but two star is all it get 

quit simpli the food and the servic stunk i understand the difficulti of serv 14 peopl but our server got littl to no help from other server which is surpris becaus it wasnt even all that busi 

there is a reason whi the cocktail are more expens than the food it becaus the drink are better jman and lauren pretti much cover it all i will add that half of our parti seem to be ok with the food but the other half thought it was disgust my mahi mahi sandwich with mango salsa was probabl the driest sandwich i have ever had i had to wait about 10 minut to eat it though becaus the server had to replac the bun after she accident knock the bun off the sandwich when she serv me it probabl dri out from the wait the fri were decent the hous fri were describ as a mixtur of french fri and sweet potato fri the realiti 30 french fri and 2 sweet potato fri i made sure to eat the sweet potato fri realli slowli to make them last longer

th onli save grace here were the cocktail and the pokemon i kinda like them the drink were decent but they took forev to arriv after order do yourself a favor and dont dine here c4 will be a drink onli place for meat the start of footbal season i was a fan of catch 22  howev as the season is come to an end i find my enthusiasm is fading

ther are plenti of tvs and they are label accord to the game that will be shown  this is help when choos a seat  i want to see my texan play  howev most of the tvs are a bit small for the larg space and the two big screen are reserv for cardin game  it would be nice to have the good tvs show the best matchup of the week regardless of who is playing

on sunday lunch is serv start at 1100 there is a limit breakfast menu earlier and the item i have tri were good  hey it is a sport bar  burger fri chicken taco and wing go well with beer and football

dur my first coupl of visit there were plenti of server to handl the sunday crowd  and they were veri friend and attent as well  howev recent the servic has been hit or miss  it seem like there are fewer server who are unsuccess work with the same size crowd  on my last visit the servic was pain slow and veri basic thing like place and order and receiv a check seem next to impossible
 
while catch 22 is an aok place to watch a few game i am on the lookout for a north phoenix altern6 star for their spring roll if possibl it still the best in las vega as i think  3 star for the slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww soup also just found there is a minimum charg for credit card 15im torn on this place  i was veri impress by the sommeli he was veri courteous profession and knowledg  he even pour a few extra glass from the tast menu in addit to a few extra surpris for us 

but the dish were deliv by differ peopl and overal it was veri imperson  the guy that deliv the chees was a total rooki  he just plop it down and when i ask where the chees were from he respond with uhthi one from franceand thisth us and didnt mention if they were cowmilk sheep milk etc  a 450 dinner need more polish

dont go for the wine angel gimmick we didnt see ani dure our meal

th food was good but unfortun you dont get what you pay for  vast overpr inconsist servic and decent but not memor food mean that i wont return  rate would be lower if it werent for the allstar sommeliill break it down loos and to the point

parti of 16 good atmospher attent for the most part dure the order we obvious had a prefix 3 cours menu sinc it was so mani of us had the spice ahi tuna  which was realli great my main entre was the halibut and if id known it was go to be bland im sure i would not have order it i ate about 13rd of it onli and wasnt taken back by it at all sad be a fan of cream spinach i order it as my side dish it was ok but ive had better no dis to the chef everyon just has differ like the dessert creme brule was great servic could have been better without a doubt i had a blast becaus we were all there as friend it not like we sit around and point out flaw work it out aureol work it outcentro paninoteca in scottsdal is a wine bar concept with tasti menu and an excel wine list that all well price but in this case you cant have your cake and eat it too

at paninoteca it all about tradeoff the servic is friend but ditsi and confus the food is realli good but the kitchen run at a snail pace

when we visit appar there was one onli cook not good if your look for a quick bite howev we were told a few time by staff member that the kitchen was run slow so kudo for communication

decor is home grown with the space be most lit by a flat panel tv next to the bar it not realli the sexi vibe youd expect from a wine bar the faint musti smell of mildew linger in the air but the outdoor dine area will remedi this issue

mor than make up for the restaur shortcom is the food the crustini 950 was cover with import chevr slow roast tomato parmesan and oliv oil each tangi bite pair well with my glass of starri night old vine zin 12 serv open face the grill gorgonzola and fig on sourdough 10 also made an excel choic with my wine selection

for lighter fare centro offer a hand of generous size salad prosciutto  shave parmesan 10 with it mix green shave prosiutto and parmesan oliv oil and balsam vinegar was balanc and fresh get a similar balsam treatment the capres salad 10 has slice of fresh mozzarella tomato and basil then get a nice drizzl of oliv oil

centro is all about the press sandwich or panini with a dozen to choos from the chicken panini 1050 was meati and tender with it marin grill chicken breast cook perfect adorn this sandwich were roast red pepper stringi fresh mozzarella roast tomato babi arugula and pesto mayo

essenti a grill chees lulus press 9 may sound ordinari but the vermont yellow white cheddar jack chees and tomato were all top qualiti you could taste

aft tast the tomato sauc on the chicken parmesan panini 1050 i felt it was a littl too sweet though that as bad as the food get at centro

mi favorit of the even was the roast beef panini 1050 thin slice roast beef roast red pepper provolon babi arugula dijon mustard and a creami horseradish just pop with flavor i would order this one again

dessert come in onli one choic tiramisu 750 but after a twohour dinner we call it a night and skip this one

at the end of a review i ask myself would i ever go back who could say no to such tasti foodi want to be the mayor of my own littl electr wonderland 

as mayor i promis to offer a fulli stock bar of spirit and fountain of cold beer to allow my constitu to quench their thirst while drunken lob skee ball down the lane spill beer on the air hockey tabl and ride bitch on virtual motorcycl to remind them of their stay in my land of delight ill let them redeem ticket for cheapo trinket with the name of my wonderland plaster all over em id be the kind of mayor that bring back the nip of scotch with my loyal sycoph on a lazi afternoon and id give teenag hooligan the boot tell them to go frolick in tilli or charlott russ becaus my electr wonderland is a den of iniqu and requir a chaperon over 25 for anyon under the age of 18 

too keep the mass happi id offer a massiv feast at reason price with appet soup salad sandwich burger rib seafood pasta chicken steak and sweet sweet dessert and to make them feel like theyr get their money worth mayb ill creat littl indulg like happi hour and meal deal between 430 and 700 monday through friday ill let my love littl bunni indulg in cheap drink and offer a power hour game card for ten buck that allow all the game play their littl heart desir for a whole hour and mayb ill even offer a revers happi hour from 1000 to close sunday through thursday yeah that a great idea and ill make my close hour midnight sunday through thursday and one in the morn on friday and saturday now meal deal meal deal how about an eat and play combo it would consist of 25 meal and a ten dollar game card for 1599 and id give them the option of ad an extra ten buck to their game card for an even 25 buck now id be a generous mayor but i still have to pay for the infrastructur somehow so id have to put a time limit on this awesom deal let say sunday through thursday from open to close and until 5 in the even on friday and saturday

and ill sneak in a 200 activ fee for all new card except those with my mega meal deal but to sweeten the blow ill let my follow retain their card to recharg them in the futur fee free and ill let em accumul their ticket count over time to keep them come back for more more more

a mayor i will creat a land where divorc dad with their kiddo young coupl look for some goofi fun and video game nerd can coexist with a happi beer buzz and over stimul pupil the size of dinner plate due to my flash light whirl color and jaunti win nois itll be like a casino but it wont be a place where dream go to die saturday will be the most crowd but will still be manag in size as the mob ebb and flow between midway and video game there will be skee ball air hockey basketbal free throw game stream water race those game where the hors run fast when you roll littl ball into hole virtual bowl wacki drop the coin game old skool pac man donkey kong and space invad hous of the dead motorcycl and racecar game virtual box and my person favorit super trivia where six peopl match wit against one anoth and get hundr of ticket if theyr super suav like me then they can trade those ticket in for junk like nose hair trimmer in the shape of a finger tshirt with our emblem on it chines finger trap and jumbo pixi sticks

ooo ooo and there will be fun littl shot in those bottom heavi hourglassshap shot glass where the mixer goe in the bottom and the shot goe in the top and ill even let em keep the shot glass class act that i am i can see it now my own person funland

what dave and buster alreadi snake my idea those sneaki fuck bastard i guess ill just have to go there if im feel the need for a littl goofi fun

edit by no mean order anyth that cant be produc by the divest of dive bar short order cook the food blow harder than a hooker tri to make rent on the 30th of the month the game turn me into a giddi littl girl but the food turn me into a sur wench dont do itive onli pop into this dave  buster for booz and game  i hear they have food

what can you realli say about a dave  buster  the bar is usual shorthand and pack with peopl want a million cocktail  they offer a recharg token card which is both a bless and a curs  after a few drink lose track of your token is the obvious outcom  at least you can let out drunken war cri when kill zombi with a fake handgun and no one would think twice  it loud in here

they also check your id at the door after 9pm or someth but unlik los angel they dont search your purs and have you go through a metal detector  yaywith the guy preoccupi with guy stuff i was left to roam the strip all by my lonesom when my tummi notifi me that it was lunchtim i didnt have to search far to find a quick grub spot i was stand right in front of an ad for earl of sandwich well that was effortless thank you universe

mi capres salad  a fountain root beer cost less than 9 i so appreci the veri appropri portionjust enough for one moder hungri girla some portion in vega tend to err on the side of reedicul the tomato  mozzarella were fresh but the salad was kind of drown in it vinaigrett overal it was unspeci  realli kind of meh but i cant knock a place that serv 599 salad  sandwiches

wont be a stop on my next trip to vega but if youv just lost your shirt at the blackjack tabl you may want to stop by this walletfriend planet hollywood eateriafter a fail attempt to give earl and sandwich a shot back in septemb i was happi to final get my hand on one of their sandwich last week preciousssssgolem from the lord of the rings

no line yes
iv read mani yelper review that talk about have to wait in line when we got to earl thank when we got there there was no line score i order the earl club and some pasta salad and some chip and there alway roo for dessert warn warn a cooki and a fruit  parfait i was hungri x 

no love at first bite
eh there wasnt anyth special about this sandwich and how it tast in fact ive had better sandwich elsewher littl lucca in south san francisco ca i was fair disappoint becaus of the rave review ive read here on yelp dont get me wrong the sandwich was still good it was mediocr tast and noth to rave about x good i hope i dont get shot for this review 

conclusion
everyth i order that includ side and dessert were just okay not awesom not horribl but okay so3 star would i come back eh mayb if i was desper crave for a sandwich this was the first place that i went to for a meal after arriv in vega even though after check in to my hotel and walk here it was almost mignight  with all the review i thought that this was a must but i do say that it was a bit disapoint  the sandwich were just okay nice prepar but the flavor wasnt that special compar to other sandwich shopi like the thai hut becaus it is safe thai eat they have some of the more adventur authent thai and then they have what i alway get  the garden delight with beef just basic veget and beef cook in a marinad they alway have plenti of server on hand and ive never been disappoint there just some littl sparkl that it seem to be missing

i struggl between give it a 3 or a 4 but i settl on a 3 becaus they could definit improv the atmospher a littl bit and park suck they are realli close to the light rail now though just get off at mcdowellcentr and walk one block east on mcdoweli tri not to revisit restaur with eh servic but sinc this is veri conveni locat with my hotel the fireski i didnt have much of a choic and so i had a lunch and a breakfast at taggia2 day in a row

lunch this was the scene of the bad servic experi our waitress gave us the dinner menus instead of lunch and forgot 1 of the 2 pizza we order fortun i had the organ green salad to munch on while i wait for my lost margherita pizza  onc the pizza final arriv it was a tasti thin crust just how i like it but noth to special to yelp about

breakfast the veri next morn fortun a differ waitress was more with it this time around i order the spinach and mushroom frittata from the breakfast menu but switch it up a bit by ad swiss chees and ask for egg white to balanc out the chees  she got the order right even with the chang whoo hoo although the frittata onc again wasnt anyth special

i wouldnt go out of my way for bad servic and mediocr food but wouldnt hesit to grab a bite to eat here dure futur visit at the fireskiit has been a while sinc i last was here and it a whole differ restaur now they revamp the place look more modern chang the logo chang imag and now  tri to market themselv as fresh and healthi choic yeah riiiight 
 
they are part of jollibe sinc 2011 some of the filipino dish that were sold at both place have been drop or packag differ  so no more pancit palabok the one they serv here wasnt much better anyway  it use to be the  focus was on chicken sold by piec or famili size and  bucket like their new parent compani do it has been drop the whole new menu offer onli meal combo hard ani ala cart items
 
chicken batter formula chang  bye bye old school batter and deep fri garlicki chicken  it still a crispi skin but it a differ textur i thought i order garlic chicken but i end up with honey soy garlic chicken cashier got my order right the back end total fubard it so instead of wait anoth 20 minut mr b gave me his crunchi chicken order which turn out to be soy garlic and i gave him my garlic chicken combo  while i like the flavor of the soy ginger sauc that came with it the chicken itself was dri and bland tast i didnt care for the rice paper textur of the skin either

i did not enjoy my meal at all it didnt help i was alreadi peev that they got my order wrong in the first place they alway seem to do that  so after two bite my meal went straight to the garbag can  no loss though not a fan of much fast food place in the first place and whi it had been over a year sinc i was here last  the onli highlight of this visit was their halo halo that it
 
it not like i make it a point to go here or jollibe in the first place so most like i will end up walk past chowk whenev im here at seafood citiwhile the avocado smoothi tast okay it took a long time and we watch other order get process ahead of us even though we order first and was unfortun made with a powder mix which i watch them mix in howev i was inform that they do use real avocado by a nice messag from the manag but that they mix it into the drink in the back it still wasnt my favorit drink especi compar to some of the thick and creami avocado drink ive had at some other place i do appreci the fact that the manag care enough to send me a messag thoughhad lunch with my mom here last week  it has been over a year sinc our last visit  it is a restaurantvideo poker bar  the restaur is on the left side of the build  we were pleas to see that it was still kept well and clean  mani video poker bar in vega go downhil rapidly

aft take our drink order the server told us the lunch special was buy one burger get one free  we decid to go for the special and order a bbq bacon cheeseburg and a montana peppercorn burger

aft a short wait the server brought out our food  i should have paid closer attent to the menu becaus the montana peppercorn burger was serv openfac with gravi smother all over the burger  friesnot exact what i want but that was my bad  mom wasnt that hungri so she was nice enough to trade with meso i had the bbq bacon burger  the burger was pretti good not greatth onion ring that were serv as top for the burger were great  the steak fri that came with the burger were awesomethey were cook just right so that they werent too soft or soggywhich happen a lot with steak friesthey made it just right

mom couldnt finish the gravi smother burger so i had a coupl of bitesi didnt realli care for itim not a fan of gravi unless it with turkey  stuf  i could bare tast the peppercorn burger under that gravi and grill onions

overal it  was an ok lunch  will i return  yes but not for the gravi burgerthis is the first time for me at big al believ it or not ive pass by mani mani time and littl did i know what i was miss opt to sit at the bar and have my lunch they have realli friend servic here and that make a lot of differ i order the combin pan roast which has crab and shrimp in it they are veri generous with the shrimp the broth was realli smooth although i would have prefer it to be a bit thicker it was veri tasti and it is serv with rice pilaf they also give you a basket of bread with your meal warn dont fill yourself up on the bread becaus the portion are good sizehungri  want someth to eat  like mayb fish  well this place has fish 
this is the kind of place to go when you want food but not realli care how good it could be   servic was great and veri prompt the host   bartend and wait staff seem veri into their job  but the fish itself was not memor    a bit pricey  but offer mani kind of fish which seem to be flown in   i wouldnt go back unless a group of peopl were meet there and it was what everybodi els want enough said35 stars

aft a fail attempt to dine elsewher we end up at king  unlik maria maria king was more than happi to prompt seat us without an unnecessari wait

ther is quit an extens menu and a lot of complaint on yelp about price  i didnt think it was all that expens  most of the entre were under 20 and that includ two sides

i had the crab cake with french fri and mac n chees  the crab cake were good even if not the best ive had  mac n chees fell a littl short for me  not much chees  more like mac n bread crumb  my husband had the king crab leg  expens 43 but 1 12 lbs and ton of crab meat  i tri and it was delicious

w had excel servic  could not have ask for better  my one suggest would be to serv the sourdough bread warm  at least until junei came here for easi hour a while back with my ladi and what can i say

at 5pm on a friday busi was crazi busi  we wait around for about 30 minut befor we were seat  the wait time isnt so bad when your guzzl pina colado and bloodi mari with great compani  

when we final were seat we order two oyster sampler the baja cevich fish cocktail a garden salad with caesar dress on the sidemi friend is quirki like that a hot seafood combo and the macadamia nut crust alaskan halibut  the oyster were delici and the cevich was refresh  the salad had ranch dress pour all over it even though we had ask for caesar dress on the side  when we ask our waitress about this she apolog and said shell bring us a new salad in 5min which actual came out 20min later after a remind from my friend  oh well  it just salad and it was pretti busi  the seafood combo was veri flavor and delici but the biggest disappoint was the overcook halibut  i was most excit for the halibut so when i ate a fork full of dri fish i was pretti sullen

mi overal experi with king fish hous wasnt too bad but i think ill just stick with drink and oyster the next time i stop bytemp marketplac desert ridg marketplac san tan villag i dunno whose bright idea it was to build outdoor shop mall in the nation hottest state but i hope theyr done  it just not fun build up a sweat while you walk from store to store to tri on cloth quit frank it gross  they do offer mister along the walkway but i think that make the situat wors like more humid and theyr so high that your not get cool off just frizzi hair  the good thing about san tan is you can drive around find the store your look for and  then park  this mall you have to park and hope your in the vicin of the store you need 

also there is a small splash pad that was pack with kid  i was tempt to walk straight through it but it smell like poop  im sure it doesnt smell like that everyday but it made me wonder how often the splash pad get sanitso i thought id drop in for a littl afternoon delight lot of yummi flavor to choos from
i was look forward to a real sweet treat with lot of candi on top
it march so i  chose irish creme mmmmm with almond roca topping

i was enjoy it for about the first 3 bite then all i could think about  was twangi tart

along with the great servic i thought the food here was delici  they give you plenti of it  the reason i have them down at tres estrella is that it expens at 10 to 18 for lunch  i wasnt crazi about the rigid combin menu choic  macayo is equal good for half the price  they let you make up your own combo

numero sei combin  1125i dig the name  i have alway had a crush on the word hawaiian  it is definit the four vowel in a row arrang in mirror imag form  veri appeal on the eye  that be said that about all i can say good about this place  this is how the order process went

it was delight to get a chanc to put on my tuesday best and head out into the mean street of old town scottsdal for lunch and a matinee
it was taco tuesday so my thought natur turn to cien agav taco and tequila
th name cien agav mean one hundr green spini plant but i suspect there is more to the name than thatthey also sell tequilalot and lot of tequila 
in fact they sell more the one hundr kind of tequilaa wide select of various type and qualiti of tequila that rang all the way from the stuff they siphon out of the gas tank of a 1978 toyota pickup truck in nogal to tequila that was evid made from platinum plate agav at least if the price of a shot is to be believed
they even have a tequila clubnic 
i use to belong to a tequila club when i was young and bulletproofi would drink tequila or agav as they call it here until they whoever they are need a club to get me back under controli could liter fli under the influenc of crazi juice
i decid not rejoin cien agav tequila clubyou should all be thank your lucki stars
i hadnt been to cien agav for quit a while and i am glad my sweet daughter took me there for lunch today a euphemismdear old dad bought but i like to think of that as my privilege

the servic was prompt and friend even though cien agav was absolut jampack dure the lunch hour i had no idea so mani peopl want a full rack of 100 tacos

th place has a bit of a funki atmospher the servic was veri good  i would return for tuesday 1 tacos

i am bet cien agav is pretti busi on friday  saturday nights

did i mention the 1 taco were fri  veri fill  that was the first time ive had fri taco  and i thought taco were near a perfect foodare we get a few more visitor this year or are my poor old ear deceiv me 

i think we are get more visitor base on the accent im hear and the number of peopl clog the entranc to my littl lunch spotsread the menusgawk arounddiscuss all of their person peccadillo and preferencesi dinna wanna fookin tacoi wanna go ta the fookin breakfast club 

i think they were scottish tourist if im ani judg of kiltsand mayb soccer hooligan tooalthough no soccer is be play in scottsdal right nowspr train hooligan 

i heard all that and more on taco tusday at cv yesterdayan elder ladi from baahstaahn probabl this side of 100 but well north of 90 complain in a loud voic that the beef taco were tooo hawtspaahci hawtimagin thatspici food at a mexican joint

aft detox with a pleasant littl 6 miler along the mighti scottsdal river my buddi and i decid that we need a littl retox at cien agav to put a spring back in our stepsi had 3 of the darl littl 100 shred beef tacosmi buddi had 11that right11at a sittingfor lunch

h 30 year younger than i am and hes a profession athlet i rememb the day befor my mc4r gene start misbehav and i could eat like thatdamn genet 

if i did that kind of thing these day you would need to chain saw out the wall of my home and use a crane to get me out of the hous and onto set of biggest loser

yesterday was a nice day for a taco tuesday retoxgreat weather for the touristsi heard a number of unscottsdal accent dialect and languag on the street as befit a tourist mecca like old town scottsdal and it look like the turquois and tee shirt were fli off the shelv so thing are start to pick up again

it put me in such a good mood that im even will to up my rate of cv to a solid 35 starsalthough i still dont round upsadthe food is still great but it look like they have too much success and have stop tri the last time we were there back on march 1st my birthday by the way the buffet was all but empti the servic had gone downhil and it was stuffi insid we kept wait for new addit to the buffet but none came of cours we were still charg full price they had better step it upi just review two new competitor that will give them troubl otherwisjd invad az day 2

while research place to eat on my az vacat  i came across the man vs food episod where he visit this exact los rey de la torta lrt i was realli curious but a bit hesit especi after that whole mexico bakeri mb debacl httpwwwyelpcombizmexicobakerysanjose2hriddvoul2zj5fbohbobhrfjgbut i sack up grab my brotherinlaw bil head over there and order two of their infam torta del rey togo

torta del ray this thing is a beast and make the massiv torta at mb look like a midget they realli should call it the regadero de la cocina torta aka kitchen sink becaus it got everyth you could imagineand then some there ham pork loin beef milanes hot dog chorizo melt chees queso fresco chipotl salsa omelet tomato onion avocado and chipotl sauc whew now that a mouth both liter and figurativelyand to top it all off they give you a hand of ruffl chip in case the torta isnt enough food for you the torta itself was pretti good i think im find out that im not a fan of too much stuff on my sandwich i think the tast of everyth get muddl up in there and you get some serious mouth confus on the plus side i realli like their red salsa it went great on the torta and the ruffl if i ever go back im definit order one of their simpler torta 35

horchata i like lrts horchata it had a good flavor without the chalki that you can sometim find 4

servic  ambianc we order our torta togo so we didnt experi the waitstaff but the two peopl at the front where we place our order were veri nice and friend lrt is locat in a pretti ghettofabul section of phoenix upon our first arriv we were greet by two borracho chill in the lot and a coupl of other suspici charact just hang out im not sure if id pay lrt a visit at night but dure the daytim i think it just add to the experi 4

valu while 975 is a hefti price to pay for a sandwich realist you can easili share this with at least one other person 3 

while admit it was a littl contriv to seek this place out becaus i had seen it on a tv show it was definit fun to do onc if i live in the area i serious doubt id make the torta del ray a regular item in my rotat howev i can almost guarante that their other more reasonablys torta would be much better im gonna tri to stop in one more time befor i head out of town but until then lrt get a thumb up122909
disclaim origin a fourstar but had to take one down  detail below

check in for anoth happi hour hh  this time i thought id tri the tuesday daili drink special a mango sling 5 along w a glass of red 6 and up  for nutrit susten i order the warm goat chees salad 395 hh the stack chicken quesadilla around 6 hh and the warm rustic appl pie around 7 or 8

i realli like the mango sling  cool and refresh not too sweet and just the right tart  dont quot me on the ingredi use but i seem to recal mango pure and rum were involv  be care as the alcohol content is potent  but then again i was have wine and a cocktail  

the goat chees salad was divin  a definit goto item but im a sucker for goat chees and if you arent you are so miss out  just sayin  befor i proceed id like to posit whi is anyth deepfri just so so yummi yet so so bad for you  whi must the universepowersthatb be so pervert like that   ahem  6 pcs of slight sweet and not too salti yet crispi goat chees on a bed of perfectlydress green and a few roast red pepper slice for garnish made for quit an appet  if i ever am at a quandari as to what to have the next time i visit grand lux for happi hour i know i can alway order one or three of these starter along w wine or a daili cocktail special and ill be happi  i dont think i can order just one bec well for 1 it just so delici not to have more and 2 the few sip of wine and the mango sling were realli power  

i love the present of the initi stack chicken quesadilla but unfortun i had to return the dish unbeknownst to me it contain an allergen that was not includ in the veggi descript on the menu whi this is so sinc everyth els was on the descript ill never know  the manag said there were so mani ingredi in that dish so they cant list everyth  i just wonder whi list all but one veggi and an everincreas in popular allergen at that  but no worri he was glad to redo the order and bring me a new one  a few minut later i was hand a sparselook plate san the lavish of the initi dish  where were the veggi  i onli had a complaint w the one  and the ooeygooey chees  oh well  ill surviv   especi after what came next the warm rustic appl pie  i polit ask if i could have the whiskey creme anglais sauc substitut for the vanilla ice cream sinc the brand gl use is made w corn syrup  manag oblig but not too happili  he gave me the eyerol  i think ill take a star down just for that as well as the allergen not be note down on the menu  i wasnt born yesterday and i know that mani have curs me in the past boh but whi let a pay custom see that unprofession  but overal manag compli and im grate for the good food had that day  the appl pie was hot spice just right and not too sweet  the creme anglais realli balanc out the dish  perfect

id go back and i hope that manag here as well as in other venu will consid ad all veggi use in their menu item especi those known to be allergen just so that custom may request these be omit  in the end itll save the restaur money and will make the staff shine even more bright in their clientel mind for such great servic for after all what is the cheesecak factori and it affili known for but their excel custom servic rightwelcomeomeomeom tototo theheh grandandandand luxuxuxux

th grand lux cafe doe not occupi a small cozi spaceth echo the click click click of shoe on concret the reflect din of convers even quiet discuss reverber throughout the place

th hard edg high arch ceil dont helpthey seem to actual redirect and amplifi the noise

grand lux has concert hall acoust in one senseth back row can hear everi syllabl of the play even the whispersbut the qualiti of the sound you hear is mar by the fact that there are general 137 individu play be stage at ani one timeth result is cacophoni one of my favorit word btw the word sound exact like what it is

how the food and servic you ask

sorri i couldnt hear you clear even though you are right across the table

wel the food isnt half bad

in fact it pretti decentth meal ive had have been tasti well prepar and well present and the serviceth servic is everyth you would expect at the cheesecak factori oh come on you alreadi knew that glc was the slight awkward stepchild of tcfdidnt you

glc is to tcf as the pink taco was to mortonsa littl stanfordbinet reference

th menu is almost pure tcf just pare down to a manag size 
from the novel that your normal present with at tcf and reconfigur with a few addit glc signatur items

surpris some of those item are worth your consideration

sur you can get their burger or chicken sandwich or omelet or  chop cobb saladth same one that you can get pretti much anywher and mayb a better version in a number of placesbut you cant get their brais short rib sloppi joe or three chees and short rib grill chees sandwich just anyplace

thos two bad boy alon are almost worth the ring in my ear that usual persist for 48 hour after a visit to glc at lunchtime

on the plus side glc is nearbi and safe in the sens the a mickey ds is safe for the inevit busi lunchesi can say meet me at glc and everybodi know what to expect just like they do with tcf houston and the rest

and they can have their favoritesth thing they alway orderth chicken sandwichth chop cobb saladth burgeroh well

a for me i just tri to meet peopl after the lunch rush so i can hear what they are say and enjoy my grill chees with brais short ribs

th last time i tri to have a meet here dure the noon hour i almost agre to becom a market rep for the nation associ of fur line toilet seat cover manufacturersi thought we were talk about someth much differafter pass grand lux cafe about a hundr time i final had the chanc to check it out know it was a sibl of cheesecak factori i expect a similar menu upon enter it had the same feel as a cheesecak we sat down and the second the menu open realiz the menu was about as detail as well from sandwich to dish from everi cultur imagin this restaur definit has someth for everyon to choos from 

as the friend waiter welcom us he told us about the menu and mention that grand lux focus on serv differ cultur cuisin from pretti much everi region around in one sit you could tri thai chines mexican and italian yet it wasnt actual as weird as it sound it realli just depend on what your tast bud are in the mood for howev the waiter did warn us that portion were larg how larg i was about to find out 

with so mani option to choos from i end up go with the spici flat bread chicken sandwich full of corn avocado tomato and fresh grill chicken we had the chicken lettuc wrap to start the second my meal arriv i realiz that friend waiter was definit not kid when he said the portion were larg i think my sandwich equal 23 full meal the sandwich came in quarter flat bread and equal near one full sandwich per each quarter and they gave me four of them the french fri heap on the plate as well i manag to eat one quarter of the sandwich and felt wast for not be abl to finish the rest but my waistlin is alreadi in a fight with me and the one quarter complet fill me up howev when we sat down friend waiter mention the dessert we should have just skip right ahead and said that they took a half an hour to prepar becaus they were fresh made who can pass up an opportun to eat fresh made dessert so beignet it was true to the theme of over portion item they brought out eight  larg fist size beignet steam hot and ooz with fresh melt powder sugar to accompani them they gave three dip sauc heaven that all i can say it was worth everi biteof the one i had with six remain i wonder who could possibl finish eight larg beignet unless you are with a group of eight 

after visit grand lux i definit think more high of it then i did the hundr of time i pass it and i would absolut go back again but i know now to listen to the man when he say the portion are big so ill just skip right ahead to desserthow doe this chain place still retain such a local feel

allow me to count the ways
  the peopl work here tri talk to me in spanish i applaud the effort and then abrupt stop when i give them my i dont understand look
  each store is set up a littl differ mean some locat look grungier than others
  the inconsist of the food make you believ they are actual cooking
  there is no dollar menu volcano taco or mascot to promot their food
 
overal roberto deserv a 35 star but i have to round them down even though theyv fill my belli mani a time in the wee hour of the night sinc the stuff i order is total greasi and unhealthi and my heart just wont allow to give them four  thump thump thump thumpi was expect to see a celebr dine here like they do in la but we were there on an earli sunday even and there were onli a hand of other tabl occupi like it other locat in la and ny the interior of the gorgeous restaur is zenchic the floor to ceil window provid an amaz view of bellagio lake we ask if we could be seat in the loung face out to the lake becaus there were sever tabl insid  and all unoccupi but unfortun they were reserv for friend of the owner disappoint our booth was pretti nice though and we were abl to get a glimps of the water show everi now and then 

the food was pretti tasti although noth was mindblow it may have been becaus we stuck with order roll and not the signatur dish like miso black cod or kobe beef filet mignon our friend server suggest his favorit to us we had the scallop roll dragon roll bake lobster roll and crispi rice top with spici tuna the bake lobster roll with cream sauc melt in our mouth and was hand down our favorit the crispi rice with spici tuna was suppos to be their most popular dish but the textur of the spici tuna was odd we werent quit sure whi it was so popular it was super spici though we end our simpl meal with a simpl dessert  mango mochi ice cream with blackberri 

im sure koi is hot and happen on friday and saturday though so get your fabul self over there on those night they total have the potenti of be 4 star worthiit was march 17th st patrick day and like everi good irish guy i decid to wear my pride and do what come natur eat onli rather than walk the 3 block to seamus i instead call in an enchilada order to los dos molino and this was after i read some of these review im quit dare youd think i work for the irs

aft hear horror stori about the crazi hot and spici red chile i settl on order that for my lunch appar ldm has either tame down the flame becaus i was abl to eat the entir meal without incid even the follow day i wasnt get afterburn ignit so much for heat but the flavor were good the price was great and the adventur of jaywalk across washington tie the whole experi nice togeth im look forward to actual get to eat insid this locat and not just rail it to a fro

a solid three starif you long for the day of music done on a casio and realli like rock out to slayer ccr radiohead korn and a slather of other random mix this place is for you if you hope to learn proper word to song via the karaok prompt get annoy by random mismatch asian video play behind your rendit of simon and garfunkel sound of silenc this place is not for you 

what this place provid was a smoke free belli buse laugh good time after a giant dinner on my 40th birthday it is a place that was recommend by the hotel concierg and though we had noth to eat they did provid a menu and a few of us order cocktail and beer no kirin this is a korean not japanes establish but they did have sapporo 

the joke were fli the music was aw but we had a great time and i might do someth like this again but now i know what to and what not to expect 

fair cheap entertain and thank some of my girlfriend and i were abl to bust out some old rap song we rememb from the 80s and could sing acapella so we could get away from the casio beatlong term friend of mine saw this place on ddd and had been want to tri it the next time they were in phoenix without a famili oblig well that opportun happen when i was go in town and saturday was the onli day they had off

mi friend drove down from camp verd pick me up from my grandma in sun citi and we embark on downtown glendal i hadnt been to this part of glendal sinc i was still live in phoenix almost 10 year ago now it was crowd in the whole area when we arriv and at first i thought mayb it was the farmer market but then realiz this was earli februari and this meant we were stuck in the chocol fair crowd also mean not the best time to go to a place for lunch that had been on tv sinc i was technic on vacat wait to eat at a place my friend were so excit about meant i could relax but what was irrit is that the hostess advis to all who put their name down to stay within the direct vicin of the restaur as the entir parti had to be togeth it was a cold and windi afternoon and there was no wait allow insid i did a quick perus of the surround busi and it seem as if veri few if ani had chang there are still a ton of antiqu store haus whatev the german restaur that was also featur on ddd and other restaur it was actual nice to see the old timey feel was still in the neighborhood after about a good 35 minut wait we were shown in to our tabl 

the restaur itself is small and it seem as if the menu and servic was go to be impress we all decid to tri a coupl of salad and a coupl of pizza they chose one of each as did i my girlfriend had a glass of reisl and her husband had his 3rd choic of beer they were out of the first two choic i had icd tea and after ask twice for fake sugar pull out my own grandma stash it wasnt until someon other than our server came around to refil my tea that splenda was brought long time ago i was a waitress so this alon tend to piss me off henc mark off for custom service
 
the salad order were the spinach and capres the spinach salad was pretti good but should have been toss the capres was sad realli realli sad we all know that februari is not tomato season but under ripe beefsteak tomato cannot be save even with hous made mozzerrella for a foodi restaur this should not have been on the menu at all given the season 

the pizza order were the bianca and the italian stallion i have been to itali i have had pizza in numer place with oven like these and though it was good i was not blown away sad either were my friend the bianca was veri mild in flavor and benefit from a splash of balsam the outer crust was good but the rest of the pizza was soggi on botheith becaus it need to cook a bit longer or becaus someth top wise was too wet our server was friend take our order but we never saw her again until the end when she ask if we want dessert 

i love spend time with my friend wish the food was a bit more excit and super happi that littl old downtown glendal is popdelight breakfast blt was noth except and it was also not gourmet despit the gourmet price but it was a satisfi enough quick breakfast at the signatur in the mgm grand

delight gourmet delicatessen is a littl quick order sandwich spot in the signatur area of the mgm grand  becaus of it locat in the signatur delight feel a littl tuck away and not your typic vega spotnot overwhelm busi veri far from the smoke and spacious  they featur breakfast and sandwich as well as a few lighter option like parfait and fresh fruit

i had the breakfast blt which consist of a fri egg bacon lettuc tomato and mayo on sourdough toast  their breakfast blt did not compar with breakfast blt or bltesqu sandwich at nickel diner great sauc great bread leafi arugula or huckleberri veri good runni egg thick and meati bacon but delight breakfast blt was still satisfying

al of the ingredi were good  the sandwich had a good flavor  the bacon was not the best qualiti but it was crispi and flavor  the lettuc was crisp and the mayo provid a creami to the sandwich  the sourdough toast was a littl thin but it was still decent  overal it was a pleasant though not except breakfast sandwich

th sandwich came with a side of fruit which was just okay

servic was quick  price were high  the sandwich was 12  i would expect to pay that much and mayb even a littl less for a gourmet sandwich and delight version was definit not up to the standard of what they serv at huckleberri which is actual less than 10  still it is vega and food tend to be overpr for vega the price was not too unreason consid the portion size

delight is an okay spot  while overpr it is still nice to have a decent enough breakfast in las vega for under 15  while delight is probabl not a place where i would make a return visit i would consid come here again if i was in a hurri in the area and in need of a quick bite

mgm grand offer both park via valet and selfpark  the signatur offer valet park as well35 realli was go to round up for the qualiti of the meat all white meat chicken for exampl and the willing of the owner to becom familiar with custom i hadnt been sinc befor the roof collaps and they rememb me when we were organ our cash she suggest if i was have a problem i could get the rest next time

i decid to round down for the fact that they onli have soft drink in can and they dont take credit or debit card cash onli bottom line though  this place is aok

i like the food and when im crave pho or vermicelli for lunch i dont even think of ani place els glad theyr backi have a love  hate relationship with them  the price is right  this is the best way to buy produc  sometim it incred and sometim it a rip off  i prefer to eat organ and i love that everi other week is organ week  recent the organ basket has been realli small  i feel like i am be rip off  one time i got a carton of rotten fruit 

the regular produc basket is wonder  it alway top to the brim  make sure you wash it real well some of the veggi have that chemic tast to it  

i am go to wait a while to order it again the veggi varieti has been the same over and over again  i think that will chang as the season changhere is the part which took off two star in fact i debat about give it onli two star 

this morn it was difficult to notic where the begin point was i guess becaus of where i park i just got out and walk up onto the sidewalk i didnt notic that the truck next to me was the begin where a ladi was sit in the back of the truck wait for peopl to walk up and it earli and im onli half awak there is a certain protocol you are suppos to follow and they are differ at each site they have an a week and a b week so if i want to get produc each week i have to go to two differ site becaus the site closest to me onli come everi other week 

so i did it wrong at the this particular site i had onli been there onc or twice it is veri difficult sometim to figur out who are the volunt and who are the custom i look at differ peopl who just stare at me blank so then somebodi said over here i follow their advic and went over there i load up my produc into my bag then went to look for where to get the bread and granola i order i saw a ladi sit in the back of the truck and figur out that where i need to go this is when she check my name off the list and told me to get my organ basket over there to the left uhoh i mess up no big deal ill put the other stuff back and go get the right one then the bread ladi told me she was sorri to say that she had given my bread to someon els i was veri nice about it and said i would take whatev one she had left even though it was not the one i had order no big deal im not go to have a fit over bread 

well the volunt at the produc station were not so accommod to me when i tri to help put back the produc into the basket the ladi was rude and told me i was give her the produc in the wrong order but then when i ask her if i should put certain thing into certain basket she was like yeah duh she act veri annoy with me

then when i went over to the organ produc station a volunt man began to reprimand me my son was there as a wit to see me humili and embarrass and talk down to like a child he was tell me how i need to do it the right way from now on becaus i dont realiz how much i mess up their system by not check in next time i need to make sure i do it right he went on at least 3 time reword it differ each time to make sure i got his messag final i had to stop him and say look im sorri i made a mistak im new to this locat and i didnt see where i was suppos to go first i was so mad when i got to the car and realiz that i had been so nice about the bread mixup onli to be treat like an idiot at the end i will not be buy a basket anymor on the week that i have to go to that locat i am even reconsid buy from them at all if i can find someth better i will not be back i tri the farmer market at roadrunn park but i think it was way more expens ill give it one more chanc then im done i can handl everyth els but not the rude treatment i didnt deserv that

th produc is ok it appear that what come in the basket is usual the item that i find are on sale at sprout that week not as local as i was hope for but they claim they are buy from smaller grower ive been buy off and on for about a year ive been pretti happi with most everyth ive never gotten anyth that was spoil this week i dont feel like i realli got a great deal for 25 here is what i got 1 lb onion small bag of babi carrot small bag of green bean romain lettuc 1 4oz contain blueberri 1 small contain of strawberri 1 cantaloup small bunch of broccolini some realli hard small peach and about 3 realli hard small mango and bunch of extrem green banana the convent basket this week actual look like the better deal it was twice as much food for less but i got organ so it must be better i guess

i do hate how earli in the morn i have to go it is a real pain especi when i go to bed at 3 am but that my problemunless someon got the roll paper readi im wari of enjoy this clutter countercultur cafe your hippi but a differ brand of hippi the anarchist kind who probabl spent their high school year draw that huge a with the circl around it to make a statement take that societi 

in ani case i appreci all of the diy music record for sale that line the wall i enjoy see rather grotesqu art i would never buy juxtapos with the usual first friday crowd loung around in their wayfar i suppos in this way all establish on roosevelt are the same

but let talk about the servic and product the line was long but it was incred fast contrari to their speed the barista were relax and invit as if they know the rep for pretenti their job carri and work hard to contradict it i brows the bake good they carri and although what was readymad was veri limit i appreci the nich they were tri to fill the menu was scribbl on the wall contain tradit vegan fare like a simpl veggi wrap to omgwtf shenanigan like vegan nacho made withsoyrizo i notic the lack of espresso in facti dont think i saw ani coffe sure i must have overlook it 

i settl on the avocado smoothi and perk up with delight when given a choic between rice almond and soy milk i could drink those alon all day long for 4 the light green beverag was gargantuan but i was disappoint by it bland fortun it not load up with sugar but at the same time can we get a littl spice in here nutmeg cinnamon 

it was wholli indic of the conspir experi ton of stuff you wont find anywher els to be enjoy with the sort of crowd that will tie you down with hemp rope and make you watch zeitgeist until your eye bleed dont be fool by the yelp and foursquar of the world this place is more of a vegan snack bar than a coffe shop if your vegan absorb into countercultur or a sucker for novelti you will fall in love if your the vapid starbuck traditionalist youll look like a deer in the headlight for peopl like me in between it will do i look forward to tri more of these unorthodox morselto be honest the worst part about this buffet was the price 22 for lunch is just ridiculous

i dont care for champagn or mimosa so the fact that they were includ was irrelevant

on the other hand i was impress with the varieti of food they actual did have

i was feel queasi shock vega so i couldnt mental enjoy most of what i was seeing

mi red skin mash potato with turkey gravi were bomb the actual turkey was incred and usual turkey sucks

th egg drop soup had the best textur but way too mani peas

i couldnt think of eat a salad but the salad station was incred i like that a person assembl your salad for you so no one drip elbow skin on top of the bacon bits

a far as entre food i thought an improv they could make is not have as larg quantiti sit out becaus the textur chang and then it no fun 

the dessert were ridicul we were seat right by them and it was tortur so mani miniatur dessert it was so cool i had a littl cheesecak a chocol cover strawberri and a bite of mini donut which onli could have been better if they were hot

th dude love the ice cream and cooki which i also couldnt stomach too much of i did tast the ice cream and it was so super smooth and creami tast like blue bell

overal it wasnt bad i would have been abl to enjoy it a lot more if i hadnt been feel like death it should be call the dessert buffet

i love the chocol cover strawberri cotton candi ice cream frozen yogurt fruit tart cake etc etc

sweet tooth be the death of me  everyth els was standard  
price 22 per person 

special shout out to the wait staff especi the guy from el salvadori was serious disappoint in my dine experi at roka i went with a group of 18 and had arrang to have a fix menu and reserv the back room 

the food was as excel as all of the other review state we sampl sever roll veggi soup sashimi tempura ect   the place itself big with modern tast décor and the tabl were nice spread out they have a huge sushi and robata bar and a loung to the side with all differ seat arrang the back room we were place in was big but intim enough for our group our server was except his name was casey he was quick to offer suggest and realli knew the histori of the drink if i had a restaur i would steal him away and put him as head waiter

so whi the 3 star time or in this case lack of time 

we were seat and brought the first round of roll befor our drink order had been placed
w actual receiv 4 order of roll befor we receiv our drink 
we were serv drink without sake cup soup without spoon roll without soy or wasabi 
it was a complet mess i am sad to say the lack of time realli disappoint us i would return becaus the food and servic were excel but i would not recommend it for big groups

on more thing  they offer to call us a car servic to take us to downtown scottsdal tell us the fist 10 mile were free onc we got in the driver told us it was a minimum charg of 25 they realli need more organyeah the husband and i are sushi snob  at least were upfront about it  but when your live in vega the onli way to go is to do ayc right  after get ton of recommend for this place we final got around to see what the hype is all about

allyoucaneat dinner is 26pp  it was pretti busi on a sunday night with a steadi stream of custom and larg group come in all night long

lik ned m mention the sushi rice is onli okayit could be better  perhap that what put us off alreadyw had to eat the rice and we werent dig it

w order lot of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too some of it was mushi though  as one friend mention she wish the fish was a bit colder  mayb we came on a bad night  but everyon is rave about the fish  im also not too fond of sauc ad to my nigiri and they ad sauc to a lot of my nigiri choic  

they do offer a wider select of side item like asian style skirt steak ribey steak teriyaki etc  and for this reason one friend prefer come here over other ayc place  i do like their version of agadashi tofu though

limit on their menu include
 one order of uni and amaebi per person
 limit one order of oyster on the half shell 4 piec per person
 limit one order on dessert of creme brule mochi ice cream berri parfait or green tea tiramisu regular ice cream is ayc though  plum green tea vanilla and coffee

sit at the sushi bar servic was pretti good  the manag seem like he was our main waiter and he was quit attent  we thought we were suppos to order our sushi from the sushi chef but he ask the manag to take our sushi order instead  he continu to take our order throughout the night and refil our beverag too  there was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten had to be reorder again and then had to be follow up on again befor we got it

i can see whi this place is popular  there definit a mix crowd and separ room for privat parti  the staff are busi and attent and they definit recogn the regular  they have a lot of roll to choos from someth that we usual avoid  overal we found oyshi sushi to be an averag place for ayc sushithe beauti carin and i ventur out for steak a coupl of night ago and end up walk over to drinkwaters
w hadnt been there for sever month but i love the fact that it walk distanc so i can have a coupl of singl malt and not have to worri about the drive home
w sat out on the patio and the fire was go and the weather was cool but not cold realli pleasant although i would like for thing to get a touch warmerbut that a quibbl the ambianc is nice both insid the restaur and out on the patio nice fireplace
w start with scotch and martini and they do pour a nice drink i was pleasant buzz by the time we got our salad 
the steak were veri good and we alway stick to the simpl steak and salad formula when we go to drinkwat btw is there realli ani other cut besid a bone in ribey honest i was born and rais on a cattl ranch and there just isnt a better cut for steak imho
th servic was veri good as alway and the drink salad steak and side arriv hot or cold as necessari and on time
drinkwat  i know it mastro now but old habit are hard to break is good place for a simpl steak and salad the do it veri well a littl on the expens side approx 250 for the 2 of us and as alway for that kind of dough i need to be think foodgasm for 45 star but a veri credibl steakhousunderwhelm first of all the ambianc of this place is terribl it feel like a steak cafeteria with a giant open floor that veri noisi it not intim at all so it pretti much rule out ever go on a date here they also had some cheesi music playing

th food was decent in particular i thought the complimentari warm pretzel and the mac and chees were outstand for my steak i decid to go with the ribey i feel that a ribey is the best test of a steakhous becaus it can be amaz if it a good cut and prepar well but it general harder to deliv a great ribey than a great filet the ribey was disappoint although it was cook to order medium rare and had good flavor it was a lot tougher than i would expect for a 40 steak

th lack of ambianc combin with uninspir steak mean ill probabl avoid this place and the numer other mastro locat i wish i had taken my friend recommend and gone to bourbon steak insteadit kill me to give such a low rate to a mastro steakhouse

 been to most of the mastro around the countri and the food at the scottsdal locat doe not disappoint the factor that did disappoint was their hostess staff here a quick summeri of what occured

i call earli in the day to make reserv was inform that 930pm was the earliest for that even no problem it was a last minut reserv i could understand we show up around 845 to tri and grab drink at the bar was overcrowd so decid against that i check in with the hostess just to inform her that we were there she rude snap at me say that they were behind and that they might be caught up by my reserv time again no problem i wasnt expect to be seat earli we wait patient in the front lobbi along with other group of guests930 came and went1000 came and went at 1015pm i begin to notic that there were group who arriv after us who were be seat i approach the hostess and ask when we might be abl to get our 930 reserv and she start yell say that they were busi by 1030 we are the onli peopl left stand in the lobbi so i again ask if we were go to be seat especi sinc everyon who arriv after us was alreadi seat at this point she start yell again say that it is imposs that they would seat anyon who arriv after us i turn around and point out that there was no one left in the lobbyexcept uswher did they all go if they werent seat sure we were not the last peopl to arriv on a saturday nightsinc we arriv 1hr 45min ago she proceed to rude call anoth hostess over and said fine seat them and roll her eye at me thank alexisfor a night i will never forget 

low and behold onc we were seat there were plenti of empti tabl anyway that was the end of the horribl part of the even mani thank to our wonder server bobbi who pick up on the vibe that we were upset and realli made our dine experi enjoy gratitud to the gm as well who person came to apolog for the long wait those two individu were the reason i gave this mastro 3starson star for each of them and one for the everdelici food recommend shrimp cocktail appet bonein ribey butter cake desert

i realli hope that the hostess staff was just have a bad day and that they dont normal treat their patron like the way they did that even 

will i eat at a mastro again you bet
wil i ever eat at the mastro in scottsdal never againper the yelp rate system 3 star equat to aok  that is exact where i would drop don vito  well mayb not drop but place  i would place them there  firm and with author but not in a harm or diminut way  anyway don vito is not a restaur i would seek out but it just fine  if i stay at south point again i would probabl eat here again  fair enough


i had basic spaghetti with meatbal  it was tasti and fill not spectacular by ani stretch

th servic was excel throughout the meal

th atmospher here is pretti much what you would expect for a casino italian restaurantmayb even a littl nicer than you would expectfor some reason i alway worri that 3star is a bad thing it not realli just an indic that it good but not great 

foccacia fiorentina repres this philosophi to me while ive not had a bad pizza here they do requir think ahead enough to call in my order befor i walk over thus maxim my lunch hour but if im just walk around look for someth to jump out at me not such a good thing such was the case for my most recent visit to ff press for time i decid on two pasta disheson a creami chees and mushroom sauc the other a balsam vinegar mix with fresh basil tomato and mozzarella individu they sound veri good but the realiti fell short of my expect mayb if id gotten them in separ contain it would have felt differ about my meal 

ill stick to pizza in the futureveri time i have been to the rose and crown it was a quick in and outkinda like riski sex

th last two visit i was abl to experi this place for more then a quicki and i have to sayi kinda like it 

pros awesom french dip slider sandwich thingi fish and chip everyon know i hate fish but this was tasti averag beer select outsid patio and wrap around seat area

con bathroomsumm no beuno special after a guy dump a duecei was forc to breath ass air and it was not a good experi anoth con is the somewhat inexperi bar staff if i ask for a beamishi expect the first person to tell me no we dont have it not the third person sizeit kinda cramp on a busi night and not enough room around the pool table

i would have give 4 star but the con kinda outweigh the pros
speci sinc my nose hair are still curl from the experi but i doubt that is a everi day occur825
thincrust whiteston bridg pizza garlic ricotta mozz spinach tomato and oliv oil was good  couldv been a littl bit crispier but i was happi  spot their thickslic sicilian pizza and mention to paul that i was not a fan of thickcrust bec i found them too soggi and too doughi and he gracious offer me sampl  thank you paul but im still not a fan of approx twoinch thick pizza
bensenhurst bake ziti was veri delici  penn ricotta hous marinara parm and mozz  this musttri dish came w garlic knot a popular appet  perhap these knot are better when theyr fresh i tri them reheat toaster oven and they didnt do anyth for me  will have to visit with a few friend in tow to tri this dish and app fresh from the oven
also tri a gyro sandwich  not bad but for the price id rather swing by temp hajibaba and spend a buck more plus gas money and get two wonder gyro sandwich  
five tabl present but the space didnt feel invit enough to stay and dine in  this venu scream takeout loud and clearif i had written a review for this place late last year i would have given it one star i first tri fuji buffet last summer and the food was good enough to make me return quit frequent at first but as the month went by the qualiti of the food declin it seem that they were tri to cut a lot of corner which was not surpris after the crash of the economi but the food qualiti becam so bad that i decid not to return

ear this year i saw sign announc the rebirth of the establish but after my dine experi late last year i wasnt in a hurri to tri it new incarn yesterday i final decid to give it anoth tri the price hasnt chang and the food  well some dish were good i especi like the seafood delight and the sushi array was decent some of the other dish were just ok and a few were subpar no oyster dure this trip  i was hope for those as ive had them here dure my visit last year but mayb i should return on a weekend and see if they have it i realli want to give the establish 2 and a half star but i guess 3 star will have to do at this time that may chang in either direct when i updat this review in the futur yes i intend to come back though im not in a hurri to do soi went to the shanghai club for dinner recent with my bf it was a weeknight and we chose it base on locat and the fact that i felt like chines food  it conveni locat right off of the 101 and shea in the pima cross shop center  id been onc befor and it was decent so i was open to go again  

sinc my last visit which i realiz now was over a year ago they remodel the place it actual a step up from what i rememb in term of decor  the servic was attent although the atmospher was pretti quiet  it was perfect for what were in the mood for a quick casual dinner  

we start with a bowl of wor wonton soup for 2 i like it becaus it had a generous amount of shrimp chicken veggi and wonton insid a light broth  i order the spici eggplant and j went with the thai curri chicken and we share both  portion were pretti big but we manag to eat almost everyth we both agre that the spici eggplant was much better than the thai curri chicken id suggest go to a thai restaur for thai food and go with a more tradit chines entre if you visit shanghai club

overal shanghai club is just abov averag i will return eventu but it never go to be a regular in our restaur rotation

for healthi eater shanghai club offer steam dish serv with sauc on the side and brown rice too  you gotta love thatconsid that a strong flavor and well season 3 star  i would definit return  btw it now zs

i had the falafel combo which includ a drink and fri or a greek salad  i opt for the salad  my onli complaint about the salad  more oliv pleas  can the salad just be a bowl of kalamata  no  a singl kalamata is never enough

th falafel itself was good  cook just enough not overdon on the outsid no over soft innard  got to watch out for those even in veggi food  onc over soft innard are discov you just know there could be a dark underbelli lurk somewher nearbi  what was i talk about

th servic was veri friend and the place is squeeki cleanalway a plus

th spell check want me to chang kalamata to calam  how about a nice bowl of pungent calam to go with your falafelthere come a time where everi yelper just have to set the record straight and get a lot of critic for do so now is that time for me and zs greek

z is a cool spot that look a littl gritti on the outsid but is warm and friend on the insid the staff is super friend and i like that a lot overal the restaur has a great vibe about it

now for the part you dont want to hear i do not come to zs for their gyro not at all call their gyro the best in the valley urk me it just not true 



gyro review

in all honesti it just okay the meat is decent and the tzatziki is good but it doesnt make me crave zs at all their gyro is serv a bit differ than the tradit style in that is has a help of lettuc ad to the top of it it great for filler but not so much for flavor the best way i can describ it is that it like eat a gyro salad on a pita anoth main compon of zs gyro that doesnt do much for it is their bread the textur is just off for me i wouldnt send anyon here tell them that they have to tri a zs gyro



if you dont hate me yet and your still read great this is just my honest opinion and plenti of other are thrill when it come to zs gyrojust not me

in contrast to their gyro i will say that their falafel are quit good i was pretti surpris their tahini is also pretti awesom which is serv with the falafel and last you should go to zs if you love feta they are the most generous with it i love feta and that what been keep me a custom a chicken pita with a side salad more like feta salad top with lettuc can realli hit the spot

go to zs to check it out but dont go there with as high of an expect for their gyro as i didi may have to give this one anoth tri but the two time i have been were onli so so

th first time i had tea and a scone the tea was good and loos leaf float in the jar the scone was terribl dri and tasteless the chef did bring out a sampl of his pork which was veri good and quit nice of him

th second time i took my mother and the tea was good we went with a tart and onc again it was not good

i am sure i could have said someth to the owner but i was just too tire and didnt feel the effort was necessary

bas on the other review here i may have to give it anoth consider i know that the owner are veri nice peopl but nice doesnt get everyth in the restaur world you also have to delivas a sf bay transplant take anoth sf bay transplant out for dinner there is a certain level of oneupsmanship to our dinner plan what you thought the whole everyth with me is a competit bit was just talk with both of us come from the land of nonchain i was desper to find a venu that was quirki urban hip and made me seem a lot cooler than i am urban tea loft that your cue

th yelp review sway me the charm interior lull me the super polit staff put me at eas the seat was a modern blend of im a couch no im a booth mix with tabl and chair buddi jetta r and i decid to order a pot of rooibo chai to start it was the last smart decis we made

weekend are soul food onli that cool i like collard green your allow to chose your meat and one or two side vegetarian can chose three side 

the menu lead you to believ youll be get a meal dont be fool while jetta rs catfish was exquisit and a decent portion size the side are serv in tini littl cup my three meatless side and well call it a vegetarian option dinner wasnot enough when have you ever seen soul food in tini portion doesnt that defi the cuisin that like nonfat indian see also bombay spice

everyth we tri was delici and it a damn shame the portion are bare larg enough for you to figur that out 

tldr version visit this spot to relax bring your own compani or a lap top and stick to the fare this place is name for  the tea you wont be disappointim not down with restaur that are decor as if someon took a ride on disneyland jungl boat cruis and thought they were hit with interior design brillianc ie rain forest cafe islandsya feel me  to me these restaur have more of an appeal to kid and im suppos to be get tank there so i can toler the scream rugrat ha

wel this place wasnt overrun with kid watch their parent throw back shot of tequila and that was a plus  so after the nice hostess told us that we could seat ourselv at the bar my friend and i plant ourselv at the one downstair  our bartend was a friend gal  i ask for a drink menu which didnt have the most excit concoct but i chose to order the uptown top shelf margarita from her

mi drink was pretti good but what surpris me about this one was that i had expect the drink to come out of a gun  hot damn she freepour it right in front of my face  

now with a restaur name margaritavill one or at least i would expect that there would be an impress select of tequila  not here  i spi about 5 differ brand and that was it  that was realli disappoint so much so that instead of do shot of patron my friend  i opt to tri someth off of the shot menu call an oversea high made with blue curacao  not bad for someth fruity

mi experi there was ok for a littl pregam to see the coyot  two of these star go to the bartend servic and attitud  the other star is for the drink price  someon from la can doubl their bac level hereif i am at scottsdal fashion squar this is my goto place to eat and i happen to usual end up there dure happi hour  the raw ahi chipotl bite are fantast  but it is not a lot of food to fill you up so i recommend get it half price dure happi hour  the pork nacho are good but my favorit are at fuego and the street taco hit the spot  it is alway pretti busi in here due to it be attach to the mall and the server alway seem to deal with it in stride  their margarita are fabul and they have a great varieti  the sampler is alway a good way to start if you have never been to zteja  the onli reason it get 3 star is i never seem to crave zteja it is simpli my go to place at the mall that has good food and a great happi hour no complaint it just doesnt wow me eithertexmex more like touristmex ok chainymex 

that isnt to say everyth is bad there is alway a time and place for franchis southwest cuisin which natur occur after a spend spree at fashion show mall httpwwwyelpcombizscottsdalefashionsquarescottsdale2 in downtown scottsdal margarita special to drown your sorrow over your newli drain bank account youv come to the right place

happi hour zteja style is no joke until about 630pm each day yes weekend are fair game but appar end at 5pm they have discount food and plenti of margarita variat to quench your lushcious thirst the chambord margarita are drink made from gir heaven while i much prefer their regular margarita with lot of tequila the half off platter of food are usual munchabl and make for good finger food while the crowd mingl away

mi last go around food wise wasnt the best the green chile enchilada with barbacoa was bland and the meat was a bit tough to chew but certain overshadow by some veri dri tortilla not surpris the smother chicken burrito didnt fare much better even though it was quit hearti the bottomless chip got the most love especi with their trio of spici dip sauc 

servic hasnt realli impress me much in the coupl of time ive been there and the seat will vari but i wouldnt advis sit outsid unless the weather is absolut perfect otherwis it can get hot and there tend to be more car stroll by than actual subject for peopl watchnext to last place on my list of bbq place in las vega  some pretti mix review but  

i immedi like the place the chopper wsmoker sidecar by orang counti choppersamerican chopper  i like the modern design with flat screen easili viewabl from everi seat and larg comfi booth along the wall 

there were a few larg group alreadi eat and the bbq look great but 

i decid to tri a coupl sandwich this time  skip the bbqthe tabl right next to me order a 3 meat sampler with brisketrib  pull pork  it look fantast 

i order the blgft or bacon lettuc green fri tomato and a side of mac  chees the wife order a pastrami with mayo coleslaw 

i tri all 3 of their trademark sauc and i thought they were all good each had it own distinct variat 

we both order sweet tea which was pretti damn good but a littl warm 

the place was onli 12 full so servic was pretti fast  the waitress was veri inform 

the onli complaint is it is way overpriced14 sandwichesbut 

mondayfriday 59 they have allyoucaneat bbq for 30 i will have to go back  give it a goyelp 365 review challeng 2014 156  365

it was my last night at the orlean and i want to have some cheap befor go back to the room walk around the casino i saw tgif figur it just like ani other fridays

ther was no wait so i just quick walk in and sat in the bar area servic was quick and i order a glass of beer and some chicken wing food was on par like with ani other friday franchis and the wing were tasti with mild wing sauc 

lucki for me i was abl to charg it to my room so i cab earn some point for my stayi cant believ i havent written my review on 1130 yet i had a veri nice happi hour with my pal heather c here we met befor go to watch a perform at the herberg the weather was realli nice so i was glad that heather chose a patio tabl our waiter was a kid i mean i know im get older but he was a clumsi kid who fumbl through the drink special and need some sharp with such a cool sleek spot you would probabl want a more profession waiter just my opinion we decid on the lobster lettuc cup that were rather larg and surpris full of lobster meat i realli like the appet i was wish for more acid but it was still refresh and tasti we took our waiter suggest and order the calamari what a surpris i realli like the calamari it came drizzl with a sweet chili sauc and had pepperocini toss into the mixit was great i love how the sweet of the calamari meat and the chili sauc play well with the tangi of the pepperocini i had some kind of peach martini that was way too sweet for my tast but i guess for a gir drink it was ok 
i hope that next time well have more time to linger and mayb even have dinner i look forward to tri their other offerfresh  easi is about as fresh and easi as a 40yearold bar slut that is quit easi but fresh not so much

whil i enjoy the flavor and textur of the steak and delici waffl i didnt think that the small amount warrant a high price tag httpwwwyelpcombizphotos8roemw4rnjjl6sd40ooqselectl4kyavimbpifiadvmi1dgl4kyavimbpifiadvmi1dg  i had to ask the server if the waffl was inde that small  i could see pay that price for two waffl and a steak  after eat all the crumb of my dish i went ahead and order a chocol waffl wout the powder sugar from the kid menu  i expect to see a chocolatecolor waffl as i assum that the homemad sauc was mix into the batter but no it was the same malt waffl w homemad sauc drizzl with a heavi hand  if your like me who prefer the crunch you might want to ask for the sauc on the side  a nice addit to the menu would be a chocol waffl top w vanilla bean ice cream and homemad sauc on top  cant for the life of me think whi i didnt take a photo of the chocol waffl so forgiv me for it exclus in the photo set  oh yes the sauc is okyou know i had this place built up in my mind to someth that better than it actual is  now dont get me wrong these cheesesteak are better than those youll get at a mall food court but like those in south philli they are not  the last time i was here i was realli think id have a delici sandwich and it was ok but realli had no flavor  i alway get mine with everyth minus green pepper and provolon for the chees  the meat was tender bread soft but the sandwich had absolut no flavor  none  mayb im do it wrong but i think ive satisfi my crave for forefath and will wait til my next trip to philli to have anoth cheesesteak  

oh  and i cant believ i almost forgot this but i alway get a kick out of the fact that this place is alway full of dude  alway  singl ladi if you like a meateat man get your carnivor on and go cruis this joint  you will be way outnumbwhenev i am in the mood to be a rage fat kid at lunch this is my go to spot on mill it serious all disgust fatten and all disgust delici becaus usual those two thing go hand in hand theyv got the build your own burrito thing go on which also appli for the taco nacho quesadilla and torta i usual get the carnita burrito with all my favorit fix and holi load burrito batman they do not skimp on the fill it alway too big to fit in my mouth and alway too big to finish the whole thing perfect for share today i tri the steak quesadilla and on the side just for fun i decid to get the enchilada sauc for dip it homemad and perfect tri this immedi

sh was veri pleasant and curious about what we were do with attempt to eat at all 7 buffet in one day  she did a good job on the crepe which tast awesom  the other dessert in the area were veri good 4 star for this sectionbut it realli start to fill me up
httpwwwyelpcombizphotoskb6gt4qawjwq47osq52xwselectj0yxypagnzjlqza9ycrva

just when we thought we saw it all we discov that there was a 3rd section of the buffet  there a chines food section that open at 11 ami was done but a few of the yelper i was with went to check it out and said it was veri veri good

overal this was a hidden gem surpris as we had low expect for this buffet  i wish i would have pace myself better so i could tri the chines foodnext time  3 star weight averag for the dessert and 1st section of the buffet  incomplet on the chines food for me becaus i didnt have anyoth yelper love it

return factor  72how did i miss review this place for so long  i must be trippin hard but i digress  this buffet is a bless curs  there is noth that truli stand out about the buffet itself outsid of sheer volum of choic on the first go around  pleas note that i hate go to a buffet and not have access to fill up my drink myself becaus i do not like not leav a tip for the waiter or waitress but sometim my cup sit empti for an extend period of time  tip should be earn and not just expectedmi person issu though

when you are first given the clearanc to go insid this eateri and are escort to your seat by the hostess you cant help but to notic the massiv amount of food that you pass by on the way to your seat  onc you are given clearanc to eat and given the inform that a waiter will be over to take your drink order later it is just a good idea to just go around and view everyth that is offer  depend on the meal you may have an omelet station or a pasta station or whatev   truli there are a lot of option to choos from that rang from sushi to slider to carv this and curri that  a massiv salad bar with mani option is locat next to boil shrimp and other seafood stuff  move over to the next island and you will see slider chicken sandwich and subway sandwich cut into palm size  move to anoth island and you have a choic of crepe  move to anoth island and you have a huge varieti of sweet that includ cotton candi fondu machin mani cake and ice cream just to name some yum  

truli there is not stand out tast when it come to this buffet  dont look for anyth that will knock your tast bud sock off becaus that is not what this establish is about  this foodship is strict about shovel massiv amount of item that you care to indulg into your pie hole often  find someth that is good for that moment and just go with that  tri a littl of each varieti and leav full  just give them a tri  make sure to ask about ani discount that are avail with the buffet as well which includ them be part of the eat at 6 buffet as often as you would like for 24 houri guess they were okay for a chain in a mall  servic was quick and even gave us free endam i know that not much but it someth  just had a few roll all of which were fine  3 of the 4 roll were about the size as a coffe cup way too big for a human mouth  so what a person do with roll that are too big

this use to be an oxygen bar with red swir sofa and ottoman as that fad fade whi not tri sushi this realli isnt a sushi bar it is a bar that offer sushi the back wall is 18 feet high stock with everi kind of trendi fruit flavor liquor in clear and color bottl of exot shape  

the sushi chef are both caucasian and in typic barcelona style danni of danni car wash fame and fortun has a legion of staff includ the obligatori blond bartend in push up gusset bodi corset two bouncer in black shirt do noth and sever waitress in black top look for a good tip by blow in your ear

start includ edamam miso soup 3 ea squid or seawe salad 5 cold tapanes cute play on tapa and japanes not realli of poki chicken salad sashimi salad all 8 hot tapanes includ veggi tempura crab rangoon 6 ea calamari 8 or yakitoriyakuniku 12 they also have donburi your way with your choic of curri chipotl or mushroom ragout sauc now that is what i call japanes not 

most sushi are in the 5  8 for nigiri 10  12 for sashimi so not outrag by ani mean roll are 4 tekkamaki to 12 rainbow

th sushi actual isnt that bad and i have had wors in snobsdal 

this is realli a good place to invit some friend for some food and fun and lot of booz befor you go next door to cruis and booz some between danctypic i tri to avoid wing these day im older and my bodi just doesnt react the same as it use to when i was younger

but tonight was special it was my dinner break and they were the closest and most cost effect place to catch the nfl season opener

i walk in and there was nobodi there outsid of the employe be my first time in a wingstop i know i had that deer in the headlight look on my face unfortun the young ladi work the counter didnt notic that i might need some help becaus she was count down her cash regist so she could go home

now im relat bright and im extrem liter so i figur out what i want after a littl searchingthough i would have been open to suggest instead of stand there for five minut tri to decid what sound the most palatable

i end up get the 10 wing bonein meal with fri and a drink for about 11 i opt for the regular hot flavor wing though they did have a decent varieti from which to choos if you think you have the gastrointestin fortitud to palat them speak from former decis with crazili spice wing i do not recommend anyth rate higher than good ol hot

th wing and fri came out as quick as could be expect the wing themselv werent bad the hotwa an excel choic not too spici not too blandjust right for my like 

the fri thoughthey were a differ stori there were three differ level of french fri in my basket

1 just right
2 uncooked
3 burnt to a crisp

on top of the inconsist with the fri they were way over saltedalmost to the point of not be edible

th onli save grace for this place was the fact that they were air the inaugur game of the 2012 nfl season the servic was meh the food was meh but the circumst were fantast 

somehow that weird gastricemot math equal 3 starguilt is a bitch and after give cartel a craptast review without actual tast their brew guilt got the best of me i had to tri again

plus ive got a soft spot for anyon will to roast their own bean and forg relationship with grower not to mention serv togo coffe in compost cup oh just think about it make  my bleed heart flutter 

but on to the goods

visit 4 830 am on a weekday open 
fuck final i just order coffe cuzwel if you cant do a cup right i wont trust that your foam and steam abil are up to snuff

it good it rich and flavor with that bright tast hardtoh of a central american bean the bean are fresh and you can tell the coffe is fresh and you can tell and their milk is that delici nonpasteur crap that make peopl nervous this doesnt faze me see previous commentari re dirt and germ for more and tast delici 

i head to work total satisfi when im low on bean ill be in to pick up a pound for sure it just too bad this place is off my bus rout to the offic or id stop in more often becaus theyr do someth right and their bean dont cost ani more than starbuck although if you are buy bean at starbuck i suggest you save your money and just buy groceri store crap becaus it not ani better 

so whi just three star becaus cmon  cartel keep hippi hour in my book 800 is late to open a coffe shop for us prole with desk job plus when you own a busi 800 doe not mean 818 peopl and while im dig the laidback warehousey vibe i wish the place were better set up for work rather than chat about literatur or polit or whatev it is peopl without day job discuss 

fuck am i a yuppiyes it was pert near the best damn coffe i ever had too bad the cup didnt even get fill  i dont appreci pay 275 for a diners cup of coffe that onli twothird full it wasnt that good

no the barista werent too cool to take my order quit the opposit actual the guy who help was awesom and genuin after find out it was my first trip he explain how it all work and invit me over to watch him make my drink veri cool

no they dont technic have free wifior ani wifi i call ahead of time and was told they did sure enough as anoth review alreadi note they piggyback on wet paint connect after 10 minut of mess around the aforement barista help me get onlin howev it sat there for minut tri to load ani page a bust

no food 

uber hipster as well as normal asu kid hippi bike geek tech geek etc

al in all i would total come back  when they get their own damn internet connect come on guy spring the 60 a month to have the second most import thing peopl come to cafe for

oh and when i said i first heard of the place thru yelp the same barista immedi ask what i took away from all the review and if i had seen the notsoglow review i onli address the clientel note and qualiti of coffe accolad and he went on to say they are veri much awar of their yelp presenc and take it veri serious and i took that to mean that they care about what custom think so keep the critic come becaus at least one worker care to address and correct them and i veri much respect thatoverr pretenti and crowd whi in the hell am i give them 3 stars

okay the coffe realli is that good

but im the type of girl that need a littl more cream sugar i like my additivessu me

you order a coffe you pay for it you ask polit do you have ani soy milk half and half

blank stare

um our coffe doesnt need that

bitch please

i love the fact that the barista seem to be welltrain and wellvers in their coffeeknowledg yes they realli are super serious about it honest though cartel could do with a bit of loosen uptypic mongolian bbq grill  you get a smallish bowl choos your protein veggi sauc and starch then hand them over for cook they bring the finish dish to your tabl i chose chicken salmon scallop a varieti of veget  a curri sauc and rice noodl the result dish was ok a bit on the bland side perhap this is becaus i didnt take as much sauc as i should have the staff is friend and help but the queue at the ingredi tray move slowlithis is me this is me not on drug this is me say that guru palac is just okay

it my fault though this happen when im expect way too much from a restaur guru palac has been on my list for some time now but after they won best of phoenix i had to tri them immedi so i made my way over there to enjoy a weekend lunch

th restaur is pretti gorgeous insid mix tradit art with and industri and contemporari feel that made me realli happi everyth was veri clean and there was a lot of open space again i was veri happi the food was what start the declin of that happi though 

some of the food was veri good like the tikka marsala  it definit rival india oven recip and their garlic naan was excel but some of the food was serious meh to me i had some of the goat and it was extrem fatti and ive eaten plenti of goat im middl eastern the mint sauc had absolut no kick and the chicken curri even though it had bone in it didnt have that rich flavor that i associ with a great chicken curri 

mi hope is that i miss the dish that earn this place the best of phoenix award and i look forward to eventu make it back here some day to tri those dish feel free to messag me you know what i should tribefor plan my trip to vega i had actual look pretti thorough for somewher that did an all beef tast menu becaus i figur if anywher would have one it would be the land of steakhous and extravag my search yield no result and so i made sever other dinner plan for this extend weekend trip i wound up cancel all of those dinner plan becaus my friend just werent interest in dine at exmichelin star restaur and fortun wound up stumbl into the beef tast menu that i had been search for here at carnevino sometim in vega you actual do get luckyalthough like everyth els in this citi our last dinner wasnt all it seem from the surface

italian and steakhous might not general be two genr you expect to sensibl coexist but i recal one of the better steak ive ever had come from a littl italian place in fort worth call nonna tata httpwwwyelpcombiznonnatatafortworthhridrgs0dyxxgdoenh6qemaig so when i found out this place was own by the celebr chef mario batali i had rather high expect overal i thought all of the food was good and the servic was excel but i honest found some of it just a bit uninspir and mayb that becaus the menu hasnt chang at all sinc gregg m and carol w were here more than a year ago except for a differ dessert which was easili the most forgett cours also consid the price here 120 for the tast and relat small portion size per cours i would have expect a much higher qualiti grade of beef to be used

th first cours was a wagyu beef crudo with coriand saffron and fennel pile generous in the middl and was the onli cours to featur what most peopl would consid elit farm beef the fact that this was about 1 ounc of actual meat uncook per person certain left me desir a bit more given that the flavor of the raw beef was outstand and the fennel ad a delici pop although if the saffron was there i didnt notic it

up next was actual a delici pasta cours beef cheek ravioli with aceto 20 year age balsam vinegar drizzl over it along with a bit of shave parmesan this realli highlight the italian side of the cookeri at carnevino more than ani other dish and both the pasta and meat were done perfect the rich flavor from the matur balsam was an outstand addition

for our third cours we were given the first of a contrast pair of slice steak this one be wet age piemontes beef serv over spinach and garlic and top with a fri quail egg for me this was the superior of the two offer due to the moist of the steak and the addit textur enhanc of the quail egg meat and yolk togeth are realli sublim and this was just a bit more pleasur to eat

th second steak in the duo was dri age bbl beef drizzl with bernais sauc and serv with a lobster and potato hash first let me address this bbl beef monik becaus i believ it quit import this is someth theyv essenti made up and claim that it better than usda prime beef in addit to be hormon and antiobiot free googl bbl beef and all you get are refer back to carnevinoshadi there is nobodi verifi the qualiti of these steak other than mario and joe bastianich suppos and you know theyr not actual in the kitchen here how did it tast it was good sure but for this price i want some sort of credibl besid your own word which again they arent in the kitchen do the work the lobster and potato hash howev was fantast and i could easili eat a larger portion of this as an entrée

a i mention earlier dessert was a relat simpl and most bore goat milk panna cotta with market berri im guess the market in las vega never realli chang sinc no real produc come from here this time around it was strawberri raspberri and blueberri and im guess if you come back 3 year from now and in decemb it will still be the same damn berries

th final verdict good food with total unjustifi price i think the most reason thing we got was the 300 bottl of quintessa to pair with the steak someon need to come in and shake this place up a bit as it current seem like a shell of a great restaur look for some spirit to fill in the restmy husband and i chose to kick off the first ever phoenix restaur week at bourbon steak in the beauti fairmont scottsdal princess  while the ambianc of the restaur is somewhat fun the food and servic do not have me run back

th restaur itself is done in a veri modern white theme and it veri larg  there are sever dine room some that are more tuck away than other as well as a larg dine room a barloung area and a rather invit look patio  i remark on the way in that it would make the perfect place for a group dinner it fun live and can easili accommod a larg parti  if you are look for a romant even this probabl isnt your spot  the select of music is question as we heard a rang that went from jack johnson to snow patrol to the eagl to 80s  

the servic left much to be desir  we wait entir too long to place our order so much so that the duck fat fri and foccacia had alreadi been brought to the tabl by the time we did  we also wait for water for entir too longwat should be put on the tabl moment after we are seat  onc we had place our drink order our two glass of wine took a bit to get to us  our tabl wasnt proper set a huge pet peev of mine in restaur and we had to ask our server for plate to enjoy the foccacia and fri  throughout the night the servic was spotti at best

th duck fat fri were veri crunchi yet veri good accord to my husband  be allerg to duck i was not abl to enjoy them but i much appreci the fact that it was announc they were cook in duck fat when brought to the tabl  but then again most upscal restaur announc the dish and method of prepar when deliv it  the foccacia was great  i select the heirloom tomato appet with burrata chees which was love and my husband enjoy his soup which he found to be sweet and his mini grill chees  we were both disappoint with our entre howev  my husband select the skirt steak which was fatti and veri tough to eat  i know that is the natur of the cut howev i have had skirt steak that has liter melt in my mouth  my prime beef short rib was good but ala prime rib is prime rib and when i eat it i alway feel as if im at a wed  we had also order a side of their truffl mac and chees which was perhap the most disappoint part of the meal  when i order gourmet mac and chees im do it becaus i want to indulgether was noth indulg or decad about this mac and chees  it was practic flavorless actual of all the mac and chees side dish i have order in my life and trust me there has been a lot this was my least favorit  in fact we didnt even finish it  dessert was delici even if my beignet were more like zeppol  my husband love the vanilla pot du creme which was caramel perfect on top  his trio of ice cream was unremarkable

th regular menu is a la cart style and was actual more reason price than i had expect  although yelp has it list as a dressi restaur there were peopl in jean there  i dont think there are actual dressi restaur in phoenix   

now yes this is restaur week and i do understand that sometim restaur can be overwhelm with peopl  bourbon steak was not full by ani mean we were the onli peopl seat in our section for quit some time and i cant imagin our server had more than 2 other tabl  i also understand that the menu option are be produc en mass  howev in select the menu one would expect a restaur to choos dish that they know that they can make en mass and make them well  restaur week is suppos to entic the custom to come back for more but i have to say that i dont think the qualiti of food warrant a second visit anytim soonhad the pleasur of tri out their new bar menu which is a burger lover paradis they bring you a clip board a pencil then you go to town choos the meat beef lamb salmon and falafel then chose your top from chees to foie and everyth in between the burger are on the pricey side but do come with either duck fat fri or red onion ring 

both of the burger we order beef medium rare were veri good but the portion to price ratio is off burger are smallish plus we both had bacon on our burger 3 upcharg but it was onli one slice cut in half come on realli for a 14 burger plus 3 buck for bacon put some fuck bacon on it serious 

while i think i would have given the bar 4 star i can not base on the price and while tasti that littl shitti piec of baconthis was my first choic for valentin day dinner sinc we were stay at the fairmont i book a tabl for two through opentablecom but when i check the restaur websit it said they were close on sunday so did the voic record i got hmm sooooooo i quick cancel the reserv in favor of blt steak 

we decid to check out bourbon steak anoth night sinc everi night seem to get you 1000 point on opent unfortun we werent super hungri and wed alreadi had steak so it took us a long time to decid what to order

thi was complic though pleasant so by the arriv of the famous michael mina trio of duck fat fri compliment of the restaur these littl stick of crisp were some of the best fri ive ever had they were great on their own but also came with a trio of sauc includ truffl aioli and a spici ketchup i hate cold fri when they get all soggi but somehow these fri retain their ubercrisp even after theyd been at the tabl for a while

i had origin plan to tri one of their burger becaus i also want the fri then i consid the foie gras slider as my entre final we decid to share a ribey honest the menu seem limit compar to blt steak which was probabl a good thing

a small loaf of truffl oilbrush focaccia appear on our tabl short after we place our order but i had to request that the fri be left behind as the server whisk them away the steak was quit good and cook mediumrar as request it was serv to us slice on the bone sinc we were share howev it was slice pure by grain not by cut so one of us had more of the tender strip than the other the side of squash that wed order was nice season and a veri larg portion all in all i felt the food was good but not fantastic

even though we were comfort full and origin plan to declin dessert we were sway by the beignet with a choic of three differ accompani pud my boyfriend couldnt resist the butterscotch pud with a top of macallan 18yearold scotch these littl beignet were good but the pud was amaz creami and top with a sighinduc scotch caramel sauce

w have a michael mina restaur in san jose and i would definit tri it after eat at bourbon steak the promis of duck fat fri and scotch pud are definit draw but so are the special offer on certain night at bourbon steak if the hamburg night and 50 off wine night are avail at arcadia youll find me there soon with a bigger appetit perhap tri the lobster pot pie or a spike shake

35 starthere are quit a few uniqu thing about this place drink are bottl water bottl coke corona or bud there is no tap water as they have no glass there are realli onli two thing on the menu a burger either singl doubl tripl or quadrupl bypass with or without chees and an endless order or fri they had a top bar with pickl jalapeno tomato and onion but no lettuc it consid health food there is mustard mayonnais ketchup and vinegar but no hot sauce

for 499 you can get a membership and can eat 3 meal a day everi day of the year if youd like anoth schitck they have is if you weigh in excess of 350 lbs your meal is on the hous you can eat there 3 time a day if you pleas and there is current an eat challeng for an individu to complet a quadrupl bypass in a singl sit but i dont think you receiv anyth they have the fast time at around 230 minut currently

i order a singl bypass with chees and the french fri the fri were tasti but not near as crispi as id like they were quit limp which actual made it somewhat hard to dip them in the ketchup they were extrem fresh though they cut and make them almost nonstop throughout the day howev they are fri in lard and are extrem greasy

th burger was good but certain noth i couldnt whip up at home mine was slight undercook for my like but not enough to have them recook it they use a 7030 beef to fat patti which for me is too much on top of that they add pork fat while cook and dip the bun in  pork fat as well as you can tell theyr veri much into excess here for all the ad calori there is not suffici ad taste

th whole thing is overthetop and cheesi but i guess you can say you come here for the experi more than anyth and for that it more than worth the 10 and the food is at least accept it realli more of a show than anyth els i was hope to get to see someon attempt the quadrupl bypass but sad i didnt get to wit one it somewhat strang but famili with young children tend to eat here a lot too i dont know how id feel about bring my kid here not quit the right place the staff and the crowd was quit enjoy id eat here occasion if i live near by if onli for a good time

i have photo and a more in depth review on my person blogi am a sucker for a theme restaur i have been want to visit this place for a while becaus of their whole gimmick when you arriv a nurs check you in give you a hospit wrist band and dress you in a hospit gown serious i love a gimmick more than the next person but the heart attack grill is 100 gimmick and onli 60 good food the menu consist of burger which vari onli in the number of patti french fri fri in lard shake pure sugar coke and pbr they have a strict no share polici which complet bum us out becaus we want to order the huge 20 patti burger and split it 3 way we order 2 singl bypass burger one of our trio boycot the burger becaus of the no share polici all you can eat lard fri a vanilla shake full sugar coke and a pbr the burger were ordinari the fri were ordinari and the servic asid from be dress as naughti nurs was ordinari the onli win was the delici butterfat fill vanilla shake 

the bill came to around 30 which is a bit pricey becaus rememb onli two of us actual had food yeah yeah yeah i get it it is a gimmick heart attack fat lard waitress dress as nurs cook dress as doctor sugar beerwhatev it get old pretti fastsooo mani freakin local i like the ambianc the food i havent tri the drink arewel drink the dfrink menu has a good select from the actual blue martini cooki and cream martini etsi think overal as a bar they do well they bring in a dj at night and turn the place into an all out club till 4am it seem like the djs know how to get jiggi with it and theyr all about opp eh i guess i realli want it to be a place to chill at
you get a combin of differ peopl who come here sure touristsbut most local lot of cougar velociraptor industri peopl and socialit it weird to see them all in one place 
the thing i dont like is the trek to the bathroom  it like if you had to pee or throw up and you were in the outsid patio your screw especi for number 2 
they have secur guard and vip host so ya it kinda clubbi it doe hold over 1100 peopl so definit good time if your a guy and you cant get laid here then stay home with your credit card handi and a new subscript to adult friendfin 
but be care this is a local place and a lot of peopl know a lot of peoplebut ladi it is a smorgasboard of dude who are too cool for school and vip host and clubber and doucher ya have fun with that i should have just not miss the movii have  a love  hate relationship with this place 

ive never been a big fan of the atmospher here i cant realli pinpoint what i dont like about it but all i know is that everi time someon suggest go there i feel disappoint on most occas i end up enjoy myself quit a bit i think it due to a combin of posit that this place has go for itself great happi hour industri and ladi special 50 off drink and appetizers

for the most part ive had a good time on my last few excurs here so i guess im get over the my dislik sorta

tri the key lime martini it my favorit they have hookah here too as of late which is a nice additmy friend took me out to this place on wednesday night it veri loungey and super casual wednesday are i guess girl night out so all the drink are 50 off cant complain not to mention my friend is a bartend at the hard rock hotel so we got 30 off on top of that 

3 drink 20 down 

overal the drink were alright im not a martini type gal but it got me through the night in other wordsit got me drunk lol

4 drink and i was on a good level 

the live music was awesom the band was great and they were play all the current hit and all the old school hitsi love it

th crowd was veri mix a mixtur between old men and young gal x 

overal it an alright place probabl not a place i would take my friend to though

oh yeah and i got a drink spill allll over me here cool bean ive been here on a few occas the interior of the restaur is realli dim especi in the day time you might need the light from your cell phone to light up the menu if you dont happen to have bat vision servic is great the moment we walk in the door the hostess greet us warm and seat us at a tabl of our choos a moment later we were seat our waiter and busboy both came by to take our drink order and bring us chip respect our drink never went empti and our server was alway readi to fulfil all our request 

it definit not my favorit mexican food in town the spice level is definit tone down and i wish the flavor were just a littl more dynam i have order quit a few thing off the menu and have never realli been blown away flavor wise but it definit solid on this occas i order a shred chicken burrito which was huge for the price it definit need more flavor but it was still a pretti good meal 

id be back if im in the area again ill just make sure to ask for extra chile or spicier salsa on the sideill score tim finnegan the old 3star  i stop here with a cowork and we both had the fish  chip lunch special  have had great fish  chip which should be made with haddock not cod i never expect more than 3 star fish  chip from most place and all the more so in phoenix for an 899 lunch special

so with that as a standard i got what i expect  fair good fish  chip  it was a good size slab of cod and the batter was just heavier than a light batter  the fish was flaki and tender not a bit overdon  phew  so often it overdon  an irish pub should be abl to nail fish  chip  if not just shut her down

th chip were thick cut and skin on veri good  they came alreadi salt and season light  when they are be serv up with fish and you might use malt vinegar perhap they should forgo the normal seasonings

th atmospher here was nice dark and cozi  pretti much dead at lunch time but i imagin they are full on the weekend  if not they have a problem  there is a stage and they advertis various event with live music trivia and other such shenanigangreat chicken curri patti  unfortun it look like theyr off the menu all i see are spinach and tilapia patti  coco bread was butterypretti tasti and i love it textur and it too look like it off the menu  250 for a side of steam veggi was a joke  i kid you not i saw one cabbag leaf one veri thin slice of tomato and one  ultrathinsl ring of red bell pepper  honest i didnt think it was possibl to slice someth that thin ah one word mandolin  all serv on a teacup plate  i felt so rip off  

restroom was clean and so was the rest of the restaurbreadfruit is a cool spot the interior of the place is well decor and they can onli seat about 1520 peopl make a nice intim ambianc i realli appreci that they serv local grown organ produc and that their chicken is all natur and rais cage free ani addit of a jamaican restaur down town earn at least three star in my book we arriv at 730pm and were the onli peopl there throughout almost the entir meal

w brought our own bottl of wine and there was onli a 5 cork fee not to shabby

w start with the plantain and avacado spring roll i realli like that wonton was bake and not deep fri the present was nice the mango chutney was fresh but the roll themselv lack flavor i realli wish they would have pair some other fruit or spice to add more contrast to the dish 

for my main i got the jerk chicken and i was a littl disappoint again they did an excel job with the present but the corn was mushi and what the jerk rub lack in flavor they tri to make up for in spice  i like spici and can handl a lot of heat but heat shouldnt overpow flavor

th chefown came out and ask us how we enjoy our meal and explain his philosophi behind the food the servic was excel but in comparison to some other jamaican place ive been it realli onli warrant 3 star sorriso i wound up at the breadfruit with the yelp az intern supper club my 1st time and glad i went look forward to mani other eat adventur to come on a thursday night 1st off how come no one has written about the park im from chandler and dont go downtown that often and didnt bring chang with me for the park meter so wound up in a park lot not too far from the restaur and paid 5 buck for less than 2 hour  oh well im put it out their now bring chang to feed the meters

i have mix feel on the breadfruit and ill explain the food which was good i enjoy it and did eat it i think is littl overpr for exampl the pineappl upsidedown cake i order that was mayb 4 bite was 950 that was more than my pina colada come on now mayb they want you to drink to forget the price lol also peopl were say the size of the entré dish were small but for me it was perfect i think it becaus we are so use to our plate be full of food that we forget what the right portion of food is but becaus of the price i am rate it 3 star for now

ther were mussel for everyon to enjoy and if you are seafood person i bet they would have been for you i did tri one the broth was delish the flavor omg so good the onli thing that ruin it for me was the mussel but that becaus i dont care for seafood so dont listen this part of my review haha

mi friend and i order the plantain avocado spring roll which were avocado ripe plantain bake in a wanton wrap pair with hous mango chutney ok if you never had an avocado cook then it would throw your tast bud for loop but for me this littl appet was good and the mango chutney was a perfect pare didnt disappoint

i order the jerk chicken off the grill i have been crave jerk chicken forev and this came with a slaw of sort mango chutney grill pineappl and a corn on the cobb that tast like it was glaze in coconut omg so good i wish all corn on the cobb was like that the jerk chicken had great flavor and kick my tast bud were jump i cut up a littl piec and pair it with a piec of grill pineappl  mango chutney and it was parti time like eye roll back good man that was great  the littl bread stick was a nice treat too littl bit on the sweet side enjoy it  that was a perfect dish i would come back for that

ok so i wound up order desert which is someth i rare do but i was sold on the descript of pineappl upsid cake i love that stuff well i had high hope for this cake it was a veri small portion and it came with a steep price of 950 if it was everyth that had been describ to me i think i would have been ok with the price but the cake was dri not as moist as i like it it had few pineappl on it and the glaze was onli on the corner of the cake but that glaze was good  i just want it to be more than what it was i think next time i will skip the desert and order anoth drink haha

glad to have found the breadfruit and i bet i will be come back for that jerk chicken soonthis isnt a jamaican spot it more like fusion cuisin and it good for what it is but it not what i want i just want a plate of jamaican food similar to what id get in a spot in brooklyn 

this place is fanci and they do a good job at that they fit in well with what downtown phoenix is becom i got the scallop it came with some spinach carrot mix it was plate veri well present was a1   ambianc is veri well execut 

i think the price are high but then again i expect the type of jamaican spot im use too this place isnt that but it is nice place to go out on a date somewher where you would expect to pay about 4045 dollar for dinner i spent 13 plus tip for 2 scallop and a small veg medley and was still hungri  in the futur ill find a hood jamaican spot and get a full plate for 9friend folks

clean store

but they let me down by not have their sake case fill with discount goodi for foodies

im guess this is the case becaus in pop by on a monday morn although other locat usual have the case pack with stuff instead im head over to the 99 cent store in the same centerhappi nation pizza parti day 
i alway look forward to may 15th esp sinc i found out this morn that it nation pizza parti day
to celebr i decid pizza was in order for lunch i was go to hit cien agav for taco but hey it a holidayi need to get in the spirit of things
now i just like you understand that pizza isnt a food for the massesit suppos to be made onli from fresh dice organ tomato grown in the shade of an oliv treepizza is suppos to have onli housemad mozzarella and basil that was still swim in the adriat sea this morn basil a fish isnt it
i know pizza is suppos to be inaccess and exoticth stuff dream are made ofnot someth just ani old joe short case definit a euphem can buy off the street
in short pizza is just for royaltynot for us workaday people
so i was surpris and delight to find best of itali serv pizza dure my noontim walkabout of old town scottsdal today
best of italyquit a claim but well see
i walk in and the man behind the counter greet me with a pronounc italian accentso far veri authentic
i ask him if he knew about the holidayyou knownat pizza parti day 
he look at me like i had just grown an extra eyebal in my forehead and ask me again what kind of slice i wanted
i opt for the meat lover even with the slight bi curious theme the name implied
wel i would not have believ itther was no tomato farm out back giant can of tomato sauc if the kitchen shelv are to be believ giant sack of chees larg vat of italian spice that may have never seen actual sunlight dure the grow process 
yet the best of itali serv up a delici and perfect servic slice of pizzain sever differ flavor and configurations
sudden the food of the god is avail to the massesyou can walk right in off the street and get a slice 
for onli 300 with diet coke out the door for under 500that right diet coke
it enough to make me want to have a partya nation pizza party
so is the best of itali the best of itali i dont think i would go that far but we should thank them for bring pizza pie to us wretch mass who dont have the time queue up for 7 hour wait or the monetari resourc to spend 50 for one of the precious pie 
best of itali you do us all a servicbam

emeriltak that bam back becaus this place was not all that  it was decent but i expect more from you

w get there around happi  hour and start off with a coupl of mojito and chip  salsa  the chip  salsa appet is huge and for 5a good deal  i opt for the pull pork sandwich with carnita and fri pickl  husband get the burger  i get the concept of the carnita in a bbq pull pork sandwich but i just wasnt too impress with it  the fri pickl on the other hand were phenomen  my husband burger was good but i wouldnt say it was anyth special  

servic at tabl 10 was excel  our server was veri attent and refil were never an issu  there better place to eat in vega but if your stay at the palazzo and look for a spot dure happi hourthi place will do  they have tvs around the bar with various sport play and i must add the mojito we had were realli goodi went here for a friend birthday parti everyth was just mediocr the waitress was super nice and great at recommend drink i had the kiwi onetot recommend it 

i am not sure what their system is but it a mess they kept bring random sushi roll that no one order and then they would get piss like we play a trick on them or someth 

then they wouldnt bring some roll out at all so peopl were wait forev 

then peopl had roll on their tab that they didnt even order it was a messit the walmart of liquor store they close too earli to be fulli use the price are too high to appeal to the thrifti shopper the select is vast and wide yet there are still item they are miss it lack the charm of shop at specialti store as well as the employe expertis i cant realli see the point of this place 

if your have a parti and you need multipl type of alcohol for the various tast of your guest  go to a groceri store they usual have a decent enough select and fair price and you arent go to go splurg on exot alcohol for your asshol friend who arent even gong to help you clean up the place in the morn the fact that it in a colleg zone make even less sens 

if you want to buy some good wine  there are sever good wine store like az wine for exampl around the valley with knowleg staff to help you out if you want some obscur beer papago breweri will set you up there just no substitut for ask someon who know the product what someth tast like or what would be good for your special occasion

a for price mani item we were look at were price higher than groceri or conveni store price howev ill have to admit that this place doe have some fantast deal  if you dont mind what you drink then come here for the sale the websit is current show a sale in which you buy one bottl of wine for 5 dollar and get a second for 5 cent that valu 

obvious peopl like have a bevmo in town but im not complet sold on it im go to have to revisit it a few more time to see if it can win me over i want to give this a 25 but ill round up rather than down to give this place the benefit of the doubt ill have to admit that it undeni conveni have all of those option under one roof it a shame they close at 9pm lucki for you their websit is open 247 still walmart isnt good for anyon and im skeptic of this whole bevmo thing if it take busi away from my favorit spot ill be angri and bevmo you wont like me when im angribevmo even the name sound lame suburban and depress 

and it is add in the temp marketplac road rage realli is a fourway stop that hard to figur out and your go to need whatev it is your purchas befor you even get home not that im promot drink while drive but id be lie if i said it had never cross my mind 

anyway mama need her medicin and bevmo got it but id rather get well with a trip to top or fresh  easi or even safeway for christsak after all the price at bevmo are noth to write home about and the select  while extens  isnt particular excit the staff is fine just inexperienc unhelp and a littl clumsi 

howev and this is a big howev the buyonegetoneforanickel sale is incred i just spent 55 on eight bottl of pretti good wine even better you can order onlin and pick it up instor an hour later prepaid and box up for you so no wait in line or tri to elbow your way through a sea of asu girl in buttcheek short or guy in daterapistintrain attir or wors yet bummeout suburban mom buy white zinfandel

al this make bevmo sorta like that old exboyfriend whose number you still keep great a few time a year but dont linger in the snack aisl a second more than necessariit a huge slice and a fair price but other than that i dont share the enthusiasm for mamma mia it just ok090810

ive eaten here a few time over the year  mom and i dont realli care for the summer roll fresh not fri roll of shrimp pork lettuc rice noodl and sprout  the peanut sauc that accompani the roll is good howev  the bowl of pho and a few stirfri meat over rice dish weve had here were good  the last three visit howev were main for the eversotasti durian shake  

if youv never had durian well your in for a ride of sensori overload  durian scent for the uniniti will mostlik be unpleas  so overpow is the durian scent that mani asian countri ban it transport in public train plane and automobil  some hotel also will not allow patron to store durian in their room  oh but dont let it pungent smell deter you from tri it in shakeform

i suggest you ask for a second plastic glass and share this w a friend trust me it too rich a drink to finish all by yourselfthe cafe at harrah realli shouldnt be as busi as it is  locat next to ming tabl the long line is easili misleading

th 24 hour cafe serv up your standard fare  they have a special breakfast menu from 6 am to 11 am and then an all day menu  poster advertis their lunch special for 777 are what brought us in yesterday morn  and im sure it brought mani other in as well  

when we final got seat the breakfast menu was brought out and we ask about their lunch special  there were onli three option to choos from and they look far from special  i wish the waiter had offer the all day menu to perus as well  there was a steak special that start at 2 pm and our waiter was quick to tell us he didnt recommend it  we appreci his honesti at least

i end up with the corn beef hash breakfast 1099  it come with two egg your way hash brown and choic of toast bagel or english muffin  yes the corn beef hash was salti and basic  i was a bit disappointed

mi aunt order the bonein ham and egg breakfast 1499 and it was a hearti chunk of ham  she had leftovers

mi other aunt  order the lox and bagel 1099 and it was accompani by an herb spread caper a hardboil egg red onion and tomato slice  

the breakfast took a littl while to arriv which was surpris when our neighbor got their food way befor we did  our water glass were rare refil we actual help ourselv to their makeshift wateroj station right next to our tabl 

we didnt appreci the extra 199 charg for salsa that appear on our bill  uh dont they usual tell you when thing cost extra

overal it expens and not worth the price  my mistak was not plan a breakfastbrunch place ahead of time becaus we would have paid more for better food and better experi  with this price you might as well go to the lunch or breakfast buffet insteadcafe rio can be compar to chipotl onli better they have a lot of choic and their food is more authent mexican than most chain mexican restaurants

pros
1 friend service
2 decent price about 10entre without a drink
3 larg varieti for entreesmeat
4 larg portions
5 good select of mexican drink that are the same price as a fountain drink limead variat of agua fresca one with stevia sweeten 
6 ampl seating
7 reward card buy 10 entre get one free

cons
1 too cold it was over 90 degre outsid and i almost want to dine outsid becaus it was that cold
2 not enough trash bin there was a littl one by the fountain drink and a larg one by one of the doors
3 meat were marin on the sweet side not my preference

al in all i would come backstop by for lunch with some colleagu and order my normal steak burrito wpinto bean sour cream guacamol rice hot salsa  sinc the weather was awesom we sat outsid and enjoy the day  the burrito was actual kind of small for chipotlei guess they were stingi that day

th onli downsid to sit outsid is all of the bird that bother you and fli overheadyou have to be care  next time ill probabl sit inside

return factor  60been here a few time in the past onc when they first open on my last visit the place was bigger and now serv alcohol mayb that is the best way to enjoy this place to the fullest

thi is a british style restaur with fish and chip the way they make it back home my soninlaw is from england and he love this place they have sever popular item that you would get oversea mushi pea banger  mash  gravi bubblebangersbean and mani others

insid is decor with everyth you would expect if you were vacat in gb they also have a nice market with item that you may not find in your typic groceri store

w have had the cod haddock jalapeno popper lol and look forward to possibl tri the walley in a futur lifetime

th food is somewhat bland tast to my palat mayb that is how they like it over there the fish seem a littl more greasi than we would prefer and a napkin is need to soak up the excess hmmm

servic is friend and the dine experi and menu are worth check out would have to say that there are better place for fish in my opinion but then again  this is how they do it over in the queen backyard talli ho

3 staron novemb 10 i had a long day

i flew to la los angel airport and meet with some peopl for a task develop i was onli down there for onli 25 hour without eat anyth 

then with the next three day off from my job i immedi flew to las vega for anoth assignmentparty

aft arriv mccarran airport and becom dark quick at 4pm i drove down maryland parkway and saw a huge happi hour special banner in front of l l on tropicana ave httpwwwyelpcombizphotosojofpdwgopvkz84fhbxgselectyoqpk5ppbuzrwrhx5cqf1g

th hh special happen from 411pm close time for 495 i get the chicken katsu meal with two scoop of rice and two scoop of macaroni salad httpwwwyelpcombizphotosojofpdwgopvkz84fhbxgselectctisofk0qwadpd1uykbia  

drink is not includ with the meal so i chose a can of hawaiian sun lyche green tea for an addit 119 

it has been a while sinc ive had ani hawaiian meal the meal was ok

credit card is accept 

and i know i can get l  l back home but the price is right plus i was starv after a long daysolid steakhous slight dull ambiance

i had the classic steakhous meal some mildlygenteel cabernet caesar salad petit filet and bake potato the bake potato is ginorm so i share with my date  and it was plentyfor each of us and i have what polit call a healthi appetite

everyth was great the caesar wasnt fishi the steak was fabul and the potato wasa potato pretti hard to fck that up price were as expect my date order the exact same thing as i did but with a second glass of wine and the total bill was around 170  

sinc steak is steak let talk atmo is there anyth that set this apart from everi other steakhous in vega well it solid unpretenti which earn it big point in my bookbut the ambianc is kinda dull dim light bore furnitur and not much in the way of decor asid from giant blackandwhit photo of past star who have perform at the hotel the one over our tabl was of miss annmargretbut was mislabel as charo  

overal if your stay at the lvh this place is fine but i wouldnt call it a destin steakhousso as i am in town again i decid to give cafepino anoth tri not much on the menu has chang the price are still a bit steep especi given that it is summer and there are not that mani peopl in town but i guess when you are next to the theater you have a somewhat captiv audience

mi meal was actual pretti good i order the chicken kebab the portion was a nice size and it came with choic of pasta or salad i went for the salad the salad was a bit over dress but the dress was good i would have season the kebab a bit more but you do need to cook for the mass i guess

what realli got me was the fact that the owner came to my tabl to bring me my receipt after i had paid and under his breath he made a comment about mayb this time i enjoy my meal and would write a better review he just walk away in a passiveaggress manner short after he came back by and start talk to anoth member of the wait staff about me dont forget that some american speak more than one language

i have to say that i will not go back not becaus of the food but rather the attitud of the owner good luckwoah holi shit anoth place that sell krono meat cone product and call itself the best gyro in town which if true mean everi other gyro spot is also the best in town  as richard christi would say it mah faaavorit  food good quick servic despit be hellapack i mean line out the door pack  the dude at the counter might have been mental retard not like drool and slap his chest retard but function retard  

anyway 9 and some chang get you a huge plate of krono meat cone product rice salad pita or fri if you can get the mongoloid to understand your request and a drinkeveri onc in a while pete can kind of hit the spot but im not quit as crazi about it as some local seem to be the fish and chip are good and cheap and their special sauc is pretti damn tasti but i usual leav feel a littl fishi and greas out 

the fish is perfect squar and i cant help but wonder whi they do it that way becaus it realli give off a store bought vibe compar this to somewher like fulton fish fri in vega which has fresh piec of fish that each kind of form their own twist and uniqu shape it just feel more authent that way this just feel like a fish patti that could have been taken out of a mcdonald filetofish and thrown in the greaser

so what i gotta say about pete is this onli go if your crave some nofril fish and chip and if you have such a crave youll probabl leav happi if howev you are look for someth to make your tast bud shiver with excit then look elsewher 

oh yeah one last thing their whole sens of entitl realli get on my nerv sometim have kooki rule at a restaur is fun but it onli work if that restaur is serv up magnific food here you are get averag food and they tri to make you feel like they are the god of fish and you must bow down and obey their everi command if you want to get serv like their whole no ketchupdont even ask thing you better be care pete or you may find peopl are gonna find somewher els with better food that doesnt hassl you if you ask for ketchup mehim drop ranch hous grill into the diner categori and in that categori they rate a nice 3 stars

th servic was prompt and friend the price were fair and the food was pretti good

th huevo ranchero with roast pork green chili was veri tasti  i would probabl get that again if i were dine at ranch hous grill again

th dice green chili and chees omelet was less impress  the green chili in the omelet didnt have alot of flavor and the omelet itself need more chees  the shred potato were nice and butteri but i like them with some crispi at least on the top and bottom  these were a bit soggi but still good  they just need anoth minut on the grilloh cut i so want to love you but unfortun i just like you 35 stars

on of our friend had said this is his favorit steakhous and he eat here everi time he goe to vega so for our annual thanksgiv dinner i suggest cut as the place for my famili to dine we all walk away say we would not come here again

servic  top notch
ambi  this is a tini restaur and it decor nice but the music was classic rock and didnt realli fit the feel of this place
th food  hit and miss which ill get to
pric  about 1000 for eight peopl which is pretti averag for a steakhouse

bread  you are given crispi breadstick coat in parmesan tasti but veri messi the parmesan flake off all over the place 
you are brought a plate of four choic of bread you tell them which one you want and they are serv to you by a waiter i had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread both were awesom 

starter  they dont have soup i realli want a soup but there are none on the menu bummer my friend order the butter lettuc avocado point rey blue chees champagneherb vinaigrett salad i had a coupl bite and it was veri good 

steak  our friend had told us to splurg and get the japanes wagyu ribey it 155 for 8 oz he said it was well worth it so bf and i split it japanes wagyu is appar not for me it just too butteri and liter melt in my mouth i like steak i can chew on a littl bit i dont fault cut i just think it isnt my thing my friend order a petit filet with blue chees and i tri it i like his filet a lot and wish we had order that instead everybodi els said their meat was okay

sid  brussel sprout  great flavor but too undercook for my tast not serv veri hot cream spinach top with fri egg  just okay also not veri hot and i could have done without the egg mac  chees  good flavor but the noodl were slight gummi and also this wasnt hot 

dessert  we didnt get ani but my friend order the chocol souffl and it was amaz definit the best part of the meal 

it wasnt terribl but there are so mani steakhous in vega mani of which i think are a lot better when you are drop 125 a person you want to enjoy everyth you eat and that didnt happen hereso i went to 2 hippi today 61808 and i want to realli like the place i love how tini and cute it was despit the drama of drive down indian school rd it was close to the dealership i get my car work on so i figur whi not

not sure if it is the heat of today but peopl were drive incred stupidand it just seem so manic 

anyway i love the decor and for some reason just seem so out of place that i swear it should have been in portland or or seattl wa love the ambianc but i wish the food could have been better i love the peopl who work the counter too 

review have complain about the soggi friesi didnt mind one bit if anyth it was the super high salt content of the fri that should have been a concern i got their special today  a cheeseburg there was a sauc on it that vagu remind me of togo bbq sauc the burger was a bit dri and i could see that they precook it but didnt store it in a steamer to keep the meat from lose it moistur the burger also had tomato on them as well  is that safe given the recal on tomato  i digressanyway the frieswel for me one can never go wrong w fri except in 2 case they are undercook and nasti or they are salti these were so salti that i had to toss them i near wept i love fri so to throw them awaymi greed was in agoni  eat it or toss i toss becaus i didnt want to be laden with an overwhelm thirst on this super hot day

it is cool these guy recycl even if it is not blatant i had to ask the guy behind the counter and he took the can he was onli too happi 

it was a bit of a trek out to two hippi but i am will to give them anoth shot  i had their special of the day which was a cheeseburg my cousin had the same

th next time i get my car servic i will go there againhel it onli cost me 500 for a burger fri and a soda

p  pleas forgiv ani typosthi was written into my phone and im terribl at self editi realli realli want to tri this place ive been see it for a while everi time i drove by and i saw all the great review on here the atmospher is cool the idea is great and the peopl behind the counter were tremend 

it realli strike me more as the type of place you would find in a ski or mountain town like flagstaff durango co grass valley ca or even vail
 
unfortun the food is onli soso despit all the innov top and season i realli didnt find the burger to be as good at those at origin hamburg work or the chuck box

th french fri were over greasi and undercook i wish the owner would consid a drive to tucson for a burger and fri at bob dobb to see how tasti good fri and even handmad potato chip can be

with a few tweak this could be a 4 or 5 star lunch spot but right now it onli warrant 3bless me yelp for i have sin 
it has been two and a half month sinc my last review

to be honest i havent realli been go anywher howev i did make it to cr last week and decid to come talk about it

i had been here a few time prior but it was alway on the weekend in the even at this time this place pretti much suck  that is unless you like to wait in line hang around with the type of peopl that would parti at a countryrock nightclub locat in a strip mall deal with bad servic and have no place to sit if that your bag then go here and fill it up

th other day i was there on a weeknight right around 7pm i even stay for a few hour and order food and drink with someon we dont have a great idea of what the food is like becaus we onli had salad my caesar was mere okay i would eat it again the other salad was report good our drink were pretti aw though margarita made with cheap liquor gave us both headach they also didnt tast veri good 

on the other hand their menu had mani greasi deep fri thing or meati beef thing that sound like they might be good the servic was good  but that got to have everyth to do with the fact that the place was pretti empti that didnt stop them from play mtv from the 80s  from bon jovi to billi idol 

this place also had a bull that i suppos could be ridden by drunk colleg kid it wasnt oper while we were there but i cant imagin it be as entertain as saddl ranch have been to the one in la and the one in phoenix i can say that few place can realli top or rival the tragic humor that is watch saddl ranch bull riding

bas cadillac ranch is a generic stripmal restaurantbar that has decent servic when it slow and edibl food this place has a theme that a combin of a few differ thing  none of which accomplish to ani sort of accuraci it just realli averagyou can be thrown off by the staff no one here was speak french   veri casual lowkey joint  full bar which is nice for a neighborhood spot  the staff is friend and eager to pleas too eager actual   price veri reasonable

w had to tri a catfish po boy it was mediocr fri were decent  and we made the mistak of order a nonthem  crispi chicken salad which was noth to write yelp about  for dessert we tri the beignet  they were a definit should miss   aura of refriger which is a  pet peev of mine   cafe du mond where are you when i need you
 
when we left i saw the shrimp plate nice size fresh and they smell fantast  i think we might have order wrong  it worth a second tri might pop in one night for a cocktail shrimp and a side of jambolaya  the tabl next to us were suck crawfish with a vengeanc and they realli seem to be enjoy itso i went back to la bocca didnt enjoy my last experi  the servic or the food  but with all the other posit yelp review out there i decid to give them anoth chanc and im glad i did becaus this time was better not awesom but definit better up from two star to three

last time i order the seafood pizza which was gross which i didnt even see on the menu anymor hmmm wonder what happen there

thi time i order the oven roast shrimp and pesto sandwich which was quit tasti kind of tast like bruschetta actual but with pesto and shrimp which was fine with me  i love bruschetta bread was light toast shrimp were plump and juici choic of side includ cole slaw couscous and chip i got the chip and they werent bad just your basic restaur potato chip my friend order the turkey  brie sandwich with the couscous she enjoy the sandwich but not the couscous so much it was serv cold which i dont think she was expecting

servic was definit better this trip  friendlier and much more effici we were in and out in about an hour weird thing was we were the onli one there i mean i know it monday but still  onli one tabl between 11  12 that cant be goodfinal tri out this new wine barpizzeria i didnt have too mani great expect as i had read the everinsight kristen review note that this was a starter wine bar for colleg kids

it is but consid what els mill avedowntown temp has to offer ill still take it ha ha first i love the décor theyr one of the few temp area restaur to pick up that more downtown phoenix vibe and style the quirki celebr photo line the wall by the ladi room make me smile  i want to be in those pictur what are they do is that cate blanchett smoke a joint on the john the giant portrait over the bar is pretti cool too

ok sinc i have an issu with breviti ill tri to make short comment on the basic 

servic pretti good came in for a quick drink on the patio one day and the server was incred friend cool and actual help im alway shock by matur and effici servic on mill ave which is litter with student hostsbartendersserv who act bore annoy and are slow and simpli dont give a damn  im look at you ra  

servic contd when i came back for dinner our server was still good and the poor guy had to deal with the fact that this restaur doe not appear to have it shit togeth at the moment case in point  check the web site for price rang befor commit btw i love when restaur have their entir menu includ price for food and drink onlin this one doe on their home page they list their daili special and sunday was halfoff bottl show up and have to sit at the bar for a minut becaus they appear to be in the aftermath of a gammag preshow rush no prob i ask the bartend if there a separ menu for the half off bottl his gruff respons we dont do that then stare at me no explan no follow up no suggestionsaltern so i bring it up with the server becaus i want answer his explan was sort of a meander list of a coupl of reason that just kind of sound like the restaur didnt wan to do it anymor tri order or ask about a coupl other thing i want a wine they no longer carri but still on the menu and ask too about the sunday movi and he uncomfort explain the restaur is do a lot of restructur right now and thing are chang and inform on the menu and web site is outdat kind of annoy when you hear that about three requestsquest in a row 

food pretti damn good the organ season happen to be a white pizza with merlot soak mushroom and spinach for 11 it was big enough to share for two who arent starv or you can share a salad or app as well the ingredi were delici and were of good qualiti not to mention the crust was  i dont know that i can even explain it grill and chewi and butteri and soft and wonder all at onc 

glass of red start at 7 and yes were of pedestrian choic most from cali  if you have a local organ pizza mayb have local wine too kudo for have homemad sangria on the menu give caff boa a real run eh 

décoratmospher see first graph for décor atmospher was nice low key they turn the light down pretti low and server are laid back loud in the larg open space though couch with tabl though the here the tabl are actual lower than the seat so would make for an awkward eat arrang are scatter throughout along with regular tabl and some tall seat as well as a short bar area you have the exact opposit issu if you sit at the long booth in the middl of the room as those small tabl are much higher than are comfort  i feel like my wine glass was at neck level patio is nice with tabl and couch as well  

so all in all i judg it on a relat scale becaus well there realli noth els like it in the area nearbi cb is much pricier 

ps hey rememb when i said i was go to be brief haafter my introduct to la bocca at an offici yelp event recent i was impress enough to pay anoth visit

i had someon visit from corpor  like me he travel frequent and like to check out interest food and see new place  so i thought mill ave and la bocca would fit the bill nicely

w split bruschetta and a pizza both were outstand  the bruschetta select were as follow  capres with fresh pull mozzarella  veri nice  roast tomato pesto  parm  also veri nice with a robust pesto  queen creek oliv  ricotta  love the oliv  and the standout  prosciutto fig  mascarpon  wonder  i first had the combo of fig and prosciutto at a recept in berkeley and love it then  

we had the porco pizza  anoth interest combin with pull pork serrano chili and other good stuff  the thin roast crust at la bocca is a hit with me

th servic was good but i did get a sens the server want to be somewher els  oh well  overal a solid experi and i will be back

they did have a terribl time keep up with the food at the yelp event to the point that i was actual wait with other by the kitchen door to tri and nab some food befor it was gonenow that arizona has pass legisl make it illeg to

 roll your rs in the word burrito
 elid the n in jalapeño
 accur pronounc chipotl and habenero and 
 greet anyon by say hola

i figur it was time to sort out what im go to do for a littl spici food when there arent anymor place that will sell me a great taco or quesadilla im safe with those word for my review sinc the law was just sign it not in effect yet

sinc arizona is becom texa lite i figur that q will be a safe harbor much like the british virgin island have becom a safe harbor for most of my money

with that in mind i decid to get busi find my littl bbq spot around the greater dallaerphoenix areayeahth valley of the sunthat the ticket

 tri a fewi realli like the recent depart kinfolk he went back to oaklandsometh about an inhospit busi climat herego figure

aft sort of detox at squash today i stop off for a littl lunch at staci smokehouse

funni stori about thativ discov that there is almost noth more demor to my squash oppon that take a coupl of pull of macallan 18 from my flask just befor a squash match what he think hes good enough to play medrunk

if i beat them and i do often enough it realli make for great brag rightsif i dont winhey id had a coupl of belt 

winwin

staci is in the old ammo bunker that use to hous turk fish and chip home of the best fish  chip in arizonabut theyr gone now so let move on and this isnt a locat that realli seem to be conduc to a success businessalthough this spot is certain appropri divey

nevertheless they have a bunch of frame award on their look at me wall proclaim them as the best of this and thatbut that what differ opinion are forto start fistfights

and my opinion differsi didnt actual think that my pull pork was the best in towni tri sever thing at staci todaypul pork a coupl of sauc french fri bean fri pickl heyi was hungryplay squash with a buzz is hard work and while the food was good fine decent okit wasnt transcendent

i like that they smoke their own meat insert joke here and make their own sauc and all that but the q was just pretti averag just off the top of my head youv got bobbyq and scottsdal bbq that will both put this place in the shade

but it wasnt down to honey bear leveland it mile ahead of dicki pit involuntari shudder

g staci a tryit certain not bad q and we do all have to select authent american food choic nowi know ill be backif someon els is buying

35 starsalthough i dont round up

mi hope is that onc arizona complet the texasizan process that place like the good co and drexler and even bryan will move here to houstooop i mean phoenixg us more great q choicesa long as they dont tri to sell us anyth with chipotl in it

oh yeahth emoticon are backb veri afraidlast night i tweet ask for dinner recommend in the gilbert area  i did get a few respons thank to ericeatsout and lynnekingsmith but we were actual pretti far out in the middl of nowher so we end up find our way to pho ao sen on our way home instead  

the restaur itself is clean and has an upscal feel to it compar to most of the other vietnames restaur in town  servic was friend but we found the menu a bit limit and the qualiti of the meat not amaz  we start with the 2goi cuon spring roll appet minus the pork  they came out quick and were realli good  for our entre i had the 7 korean style beef short rib and jare went for the 21 pho ga aka chicken noodl soup  we both agre entre were just alright  i also had a coconut juic beverag which i later learn came from a can  

bottom line is this place simpli phonomen as their taglin say  not so much and we probabl wont be rush back anytim soon but it was aoki arriv today at 11am  was greet with a warm welcom from the veri tall hostess  she was sweet  had a nice smile too  

we were seat within 5 minut and our waitress seem sweet as well  we order our food  i go the salmon w angel hair lunch entre  i dont rememb the exact name for it but that what it had  anyway our food arriv and all i could see was how oili the pasta was gaaroosss good thing i was hungri and didnt eat ani breakfast yet so i ate at least half of my entre but  after eat all that oili pasta i want to barf  the salmon was cook almost perfect  i enjoy it  

the waitress was so great either  though she seem sweet she never came back to check on us and took forev get the check to us  i dont know if i would come back here again sinc this is the second time i tri brio but who know i think i might tri it at least one last time  hope the third time is a charmthis place is veri nice insid fanci the food was good but i wouldnt rate it more than 3 star they do have a pretti nice present thougha recent visit to celebr a friend birthday yard hous left me feel disappoint  we had a larg parti about 14 peopl at the tabl  dure our visit we even had a shift chang where our origin waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leav and who was take over  

although the rest of our tabl had appet the husband and i arriv in time for entrees

 new york steak salad green bean roast pepper avocado crispi potato red onion and babi lettuc toss in a gorgonzola vinaigrett with beefsteak tomato and pickl egg 1695  a generous and flavor salad load with the ingredi list and a tasti steak

 cuban roast pork dip tomato pepper jack chees pickl dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grill with bbq au jus 1265  this was the husband order and i had a bite  it wasnt that great especi when i recal my previous experi with a cuban sandwich  the fri were good though

mi concern was more with servic  the waiter ask the birthday girl what kind of dessert she want out of three choic and she went for the chocol souffl cake mini serv with vanilla ice cream serv warm  when it arriv there was no candl which surpris us all  how are you suppos to sing happi birthday without a candl to blow  and he onli gave us one spoon which remind me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us  at this point we didnt bother order dessert sinc the birthday girl alreadi had her  that part made the experi disappointing

th other waiter was abl to do a split tender on the check which was help  although he put the cost wrong on my receipt oh well  i usual think yard hous is on top of thing but i guess they werent that nightnote everi time you read the word groupon you have to take a shot

iv been here sever time but havent felt the need to write a review until tonight experi  let me prefac that most everyon dinner was 4 to 5 star  everyon rave about the panko fri fish  the food was except except for the fri shrimp which was overcooked

let take this step by step  first when my wife call the woman who answer the phone was veri rush and hung up on my wife as soon as she complet her order but befor she could ask a few question  ok theyr probabl pretti busi but they should know that theyr go to turn off custom with poor service

i roll up with a 20 groupon in hand and the woman work the counter who presum was the same woman answer the phone let me know in no uncertain term that the groupon deal was cost her money now ill assum that she is the owner

sh complain that patron would tell her that the menu price are too expens but that onc the compani offer a groupon deal the same peopl show up with a groupon and they usual have a line out the door  then she mention that the economi must be pretti bad for so mani peopl to get in on the groupon and ask me where i acquir my groupon deal  i repli the internet

tri to make her feel a tad better about this lose proposit i remind her that the benefit of the groupon was to bring in new clientel  she said that the deal doe bring in a lot of busi but that she lost money on all that business

i repli that the payoff would be returnbusi and she said someth to the effect of yeah most groupon peopl dont come back  what about you  am i go to get your return business

mi plea to the proprietor of this locat would be
1 dont complain to the custom about the promot deal they show up with  if you must complain then complain to the peopl at corpor who enter into the groupon deal  never complain to the customer
2 dont be rude to your custom  i know if may be hard to hold your tongu and your probabl realli busi and your a littl overwhelm at the prospect of not get compens for your hard work but you can pretti much ensur a custom wont return if your rude to them

i think this locat serv great food they just need to get their custom servic in order  i want to see this busi thrive becaus i like their product  cmon guy dont ruin it with poor prevent choicsaturday night
dat night

let tri somewher new i suggest to my man and ala he agrees

ten minut later we find ourselv sit in littl rangoon  were the onli one in the place asid from the staff  we probabl wouldv left had it not been for the peopl love us on yelp sticker on the door and alfr the friend owner who was also our waiter

jar not onli agre to go somewher new but he allow me to do the order  the first dish that caught my eye was some sort of vegetarian dish that alfr said peopl either love it or hate it  he wasnt tri too hard to sell it so we went with some more common at least to us choic from the menu  spring roll the kind that are not fri with chicken a noodl dish similar to a pad seu eu and a veget dish with tofu that we ad okra to  i love okra

unfortun the chicken in the spring roll was rubberi and kind of gross and the veget dish was cover in a realli oili sauc that lack flavor  id probabl give this place two star but alfr was nice enough and they serv okra  huge prop for that  even so the meal was pricey for what we had and i dont think ill be return anytim soon  i hope it was an off night for their sake  

and now becaus of our soso  not fantast experi i am pretti sure i will not be allow to choos the date night restaur for a while i absolut love the interior of maria maria upon entri im instant relax especi when they dim the light round 730 pm 

there a pictur hang near the hostess tabl that i wish i could snatch off the wall and run away with i love it if you see it it the pictur of a guitar etch upon the back of a femal lovely

but what about the grub well

first trip here i sat in the bar area i order their bake chees with chicken ham and chrizo it came with warm thin tortilla a bit too greasi for me  some would say i should have expect this  but i thought over all that it was good it sat in my belli like a rock though

mi second trip here my friend and i sat in a mini loung area under one of the huge plasma screen it was a comfi space that beg to be occupi on an earli friday even we each order a drink sangria for two sangria blanco for one four peak sunbru for me 

then all 4 of us split the seafood guacamol oh yum if you order anyth of the menu this is a must the lump jumbo crab meat with shrimp is heaven i could have eaten just the warm seafood that come on top of the guac in fact we did ask for just a side of that unfortun when the check came we were charg for 2 order of seafood guac so basic we were charg 28 for seafood guac with extra seafood go figur if i had known i wouldnt have order it on the side three salsa chip and the seafood guac was hearti enough to satisfi us for kick one friend order the plantain i had a nibbl it was good though im no fan of the creami white stuff on top icky

a for drink the sunbru was just okay they do have a pretti good drink menu though between beer and wine id be set here ani day of the week they offer 2 differ viogner by the glass they do have plenti of mix specialti drink for those who like their hard liquor 

if you like coffe they serv that too when ask what super strong java they had given me i was told it was from the brand mr espresso and here i thought i may be drink authent coffe for it sure pack a super strong punch

i have to say that while i realli realli realli dig the decor and atmospher the food has for two time in a row made my tummi a littl bit upset i cant put my finger on whi it would but it make me a littl concern to go back i think if i do ill order the spinach mango salad with grill shrimp with almond and raisin for 13 it better be great 

if your at temp marketplac check this place out my friend and i end up sit around and chat for a few hour our server was veri nice though toward the end he got slam with other patron and neglect us a bit it was understand sinc we were basic onli there to nosh and drink 

drum roll
maria maria gets
4 star for atmospher and decor 
4 star for service
2 star for food that make my tummi a tad upset
2 star for the live music that night it didnt seem to fit the motif 

for a final score of 3 star which is a typic it worth check out but dont expect to be blown away rate i realli wish i could rate this place higher i want to buti just cantwhile my better half was make moolah at the poker tabl i need to escap the dingdingd sound of the casino and decid to grab some happi hour a short walk from the encor sushisamba seem to fit my need for some discount booz and appet 

their long oval bar by the main entranc was pretti much empti so i easili settl into a spot and perus their happi hour offer they offer three differ whiskey cocktail concoct for 6 not be a huge whiskey fan i pick the one that sound the least rough to me it was actual pretti decent although i could have use a littl more cocktail and a lot less ice 

i pick three appet an amount that is general plenti at most happi hour to fill me up to the brim the shrimp  chorizo skewer httpwwwyelpcombizphotosph0blkl4cbxkzu471vznuaselectrdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7hardjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7ha were my favorit the shrimp was bare cook through with nice char mark and the chorizo had great flavor the chimichurrilik sauc on top was great i could have eaten a lot more of these the slice ahi tuna httpwwwyelpcombizphotosph0blkl4cbxkzu471vznuaselectrdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7haamdctlnjwrfnmkpbpgf0a consist of two veri thin piec of ahi drown  in a soymustard sauc and top with a halv cherri tomato and some leav this portion was super tini and made me wonder whether happi hour at this place meant you get a quarter of the portion for half the price of the regular appet dish i got the same feel with the shred pork mini taco httpwwwyelpcombizphotosph0blkl4cbxkzu471vznuaselectrdjuwvrioa0mxgtmilq7hai30qdbtwzsj2f8tnbjkqlq one bite and those sucker were gone the spici sauc on the side serv in a shot glass look cool but it was so frickin hot the bartend thorough warn me that you could onli use a mini droplet on each taco so what was the point of serv that much sauc again the portion size was disappoint and the taco was just averag 

two drink  three appet  37 includ tip i left hungri and unimpress for around 40 i can usual eat and drink myself into stupid at happi hour sheesh i could have had a great entre and a nice glass of wine at mani of vega amaz restaur instead oh well sushisamba is overpr for it portion and the dish were noth mind blow dont think ill be back here anytim sooni love sprout i want to give this place 5starsand mayb i would if they hire employe that smile and were friend how come no one ever smile here are they all miserable

i love their cooki  they have the best cooki soft and delicious

sup clean restrooms

fre product sampl basket in the general merchandis dept

i notic that they quick ad more cashier when the line were get long  this is a plus

th cashier was friend and was probabl the onli employe that smiledoh wait that was anoth customling  loui is quit alright noth that leav me instant crave a return trip but good enough that im realli glad to have tri it 

we start off by tri a coupl of their appet the crab wonton and the coconut shrimp both were pretti tasti and were serv with a sweet and tangi tropic sauc that i quit enjoy i do wish that the crab wonton would have been a bit crunchier though for our main dish we split the fn slider which were these mini burger load with strip of steak they werent too bad but were pretti messi and hard to eat without feel like a slob the best thing we had was probabl the tom kai gai soup slight spici but veri flavor this is the type of place thatd probabl work a littl better with more of a peiwei type of set up it has more of a casual almost barlik atmospher it doesnt feel like your at an asian restaur when your here 

in the end it a cool concept asian dish with more tradit american fusion it just didnt wow me like it could have still it a solid spot with a fun menu that you should tri 355servic at the boulangeriepatisseri is almost alway attent and eight time out of ten theyr more than will to offer free sampl as oppos to my ask to sampl someth and my receiv an eager yes of cours or a stare that say im too busi to stop and acknowledg your request  id give four star in an instant if it werent for the fact that everi time i show up with a gift certif to use my employ issu out gift cert to basha everi year for thanksgiv andor christma it guarante that the transact will take anywher from ten to thirti minut or more and at least one or more cowork aid  arm with this fact i alway make sure i have extra free time befor shop at an ajs

it best to call earli in the morn befor 103011 to catch the baker on site if you have ani food concern  while some of the bake sweet good are made from scratch most are from proprietari mix  on my last visit i opt to buy a red velvet muffin with chocol chip without sampl it first sinc the nice young man behind the counter didnt immedi say yes to sampl the bake item though he did offer to let me tri ani of the flavor coffe if i want  it turn out that the sign was wrong and the muffin did not contain ani chocol chip  fyi the muffin here are made from a box mix or so i was told by an older employe behind the counter who seem too busi to stop and help much less greet anyon hello  i return the good and ask for a refund

drip black coffe was ok and it alway nice to see locallymad chocol on displayi didnt come here for the anorex asian or the brunett who lack person i didnt come here becaus they show off their rib cage i came here to eat 

the place is a gimmick insid a gimmick they onli offer pbr and miller high life their soda are in bottl with the coke be mexican glass bottl coke which as we all know is fuckin delici 

the menu consist of singl 12 lb burger doubl tripl hot dog french fri or onion ring 

the burger start at 8 go up 2 increment for everi tower patti ad fri or ring are extra 
the god damn burger are  monstrous with a doubl be probabl 6 tall but the chef in me was a littl puzzl at the time of the food the cook must of been bend the law of thermodynam becaus i got 1 lb of cook ground beef that was hot mind you in 8 minut that tell me that they have the burger sandbag in the back sandbag is a culinari term for partial cook and readi to go
th burger come dress with chili american and swiss chees and tomato 

i paid 14 for coke doubl burger and order of fri not too bad tax is includ in the price 

id come back again with my ol man the food is guy food and the flagrant arm touch the 19 year old server dish out is enough to keep my old man breath anoth daywith all the recent craze for china mama and their famous xlbs how could i say no  

for our parti of three this is what we got

 p23 steam juici pork bun 8 aka xiao lung bao 725  the famous xlbs  at first i thought they seem a bit expens but onc i got a look at these bugger i realiz they were big one  the waiter bring a soy sauc dish with slice ginger and we pour a bit of the black vinegar to mix with the ginger  we attempt to pick up each dumpl without break them but it prove fruitless  everi singl one broke as their skin stuck to the paper line  no hot juici good insid at all but rather all over the plate instead  they were inde meati but that all they were just meati  i wouldnt say they had a whole lot of tast and the skin were dri out on top  ive had better xlbs elsewher so they werent a big winner for me  
 
 p29 beef roll 699  we had to order this becaus it was mention in the las vega week review and sound interest enough  it definit uniqu and someth weve never seen or tast befor and probabl the favorit dish of the night  it roll into a big pinwheel and pretti good

 h50 chicken with pickl chili sauc 1395  the allur of pickl was what prompt us to order this dish  but there was no pickl in sight  just a spici chicken dish with larg piec of red bell pepper  good but not what we were expecting

 h98 eggplant  basil prep in hot pot 895  look for some veget we chose this one  it came in a pot with a flame go on underneath  pretti tasti but not spectacular

 h108 stir fri shred potato 795  similar to a dish weve order at yun nan garden but this one lack some much need seasoning

servic was good  tea was brought over prompt along with two menus  the staff speak english and ask if we need water  

leftov of the chicken and eggplant tast even better the next day

overal i came with high expect of the xlbs and it fell short  the beef roll was the big surpris hit though  the other dish were good or averag but noth to have me crave more  the husband enjoy the servic here much better than other chines restaur weve encount in vega3 12 stars

alright ill tri and make this one short and sweet and follow the old express if you dont have anyth nice to say becaus i realli did like part of il posto

let me start by say that the staff was incred  about 20 or so of us yelper gather yesterday for a happi hour organ by the fantast christina p and the staffer were veri pleas to oblige

lik bacon b said befor me im alway nervous about be a part of a larg parti becaus it is practic inevit that they are go to screw up at least some of our order and it is guarante that mine will alway be one of them  that said this was sooo not the case here  i was shock  we sat outsid and were all serv at our leisur by 1 bartend who i from here on out will refer to as superman becaus he obvious had some sort of magic power to serv all 20 of us individu simultan and screw up no one order mind you

il continu to touch on the good  the patio was great  veri spacious area with a fire pit in the middl which ad some love ambianc to the even and hey who doesnt look better by firelight 

now on to the less than good

th happi hour special were okay to be honest im not thrill by 1 off of thing i think it kind of weak  howev mani of il posto drink price were alreadi fair low so the 1 off could sway some

first of all i will say that their fresh bread and pesto dip which was free mind you was delici  the pizza though not so muchlet me prefac this by say that i am from nyc and i take my pizza veri seriouslyit is a bit of an art for me

i dont want to say too much becaus i do want to go back and tri some differ thing becaus the rest of the experi was love but no unfortun i did not enjoy my pizza  it was undercook the dough was unimpress and i had to use a knife and fork becaus it was so soggy

al in all i had a nice time at il posto main becaus of the compani but i would be will to go back and give it anoth shotwhen we arriv we were told there was a 45 minut wait i look around at all the empti tabl hmm so where are all these peopl and where are they waiting

sh point me next door to a realli cool and swanki loung i couldnt tell if this was an extens of the restaur or  a separ entiti either way it was pretti cool we sat down and order a drink then not 5 minut later the hostess came in and told us tabl was readi now i cant realli complain that our 45 minut wait turn in to a 5 minut wait but honest with all the empti tabl in the place it felt as if they were tri to turn peopl away 

the starter bread was fresh and the pesto was divin we order the eggplant rollatini to start and were sore disappoint at the mushi mess place in front of us it had the consist of soggi enchilada and tri as i might i could not find eggplant through all the chees 

i order a salad and it was forgotten i ask for it again after we got our main and it was forgotten the main was a cavatelli someth pasta tomato bell pepper onion and sausag it was decent but i could have made it better myself at home 

we also order a 32 bottl of pinot noir now i know that there is a huge mark up on bottl of wine but pleas take the aj 799 price tag off befor put it down in front of me

3 star for venu alon the patio absolut rock and the new loung next door is great for after dinner cocktail the food and servic need a littl work but ill probabl come back and tri the pizzafli make me hungri actual life make me hungri but fli make me extra hungri  it hard work sit on that plane for 4 hour so as soon as i land in phoenix last night i was readi for some grub gabi k pick me up from the airport and took me straight to julio too to meet some of her friend for dinner 

when we arriv there was a basket of chip and lot of salsa wait for usthank julio  as i fill up on chip i check out the menu and was torn between the shrimp fajita and fish taco  i decid on the shrimp taco as did gabi and soon we were greet with lot of food we probabl should have share but like i said beforefli make me hungri  ive had better fajita in my life but they were tasti and veri filling

of cours i manag to eat much more than one of gabi friend whos 4 month pregno but ill blame my piggy on the flimolli had a stand at the westgat farmer market and i tri one of her fullsiz sampl of red pork it was veri tasti and moist if not as spici as i would like she did say that you can request that your dozen be made spicier 

it was also realli full of meat she also said that she onli use realli good cut of meat and no lard

howev i pass on buy a dozen as i thought 26 was a littl high and i want to tri some more elsewherlocat insid caesar java coast is basic just a cafe that serv coffe latt pastri and gelato  yes i said gelato i couldnt help myself and had a scoop of their peanut butter gelato one even i thought that this was a littl sweet and pricey but total hit the spot when your crave dessert  in the morn java coast was our breakfast of choic becaus it was comp i had a bagel and an ice americano while the gf had some chocol pastri and a latt i guess we cant complain becaus we both finish our breakfast  all their bagel bread donut and pastri are in a clear bin where basic serv yourself  although there tong for you to grab your breakfast this isnt the most sanit way to get breakfast after pay for our breakfast i notic a few peopl grab their bagel donut and pastri with their hand  this place should at least have sign state to use the tong  as for their price seem like everyth was overpr i guess i shouldnt complaint sinc our meal were comped

overal i found java coast as just aokdo you like crackerlik ultra crunchi pizza crust then this is the place for you 

the menu consist of salad pizza and i think a coupl pasta and sandwich my sister and i came here for lunch with her two young boy age 5 and 3 it the type of place where you order at a counter they give you a number and then bring your food to you there is a soda fountain with the usual suspect and some tea 

mi sister order the chicken caesar pizza i had the mushroom and pepperoni my pizza was over greasi and her had to be eaten with a knife and fork the crust is just ridicul im not kid when i say it like a cracker onli mine got soggi from the grease

th boy did not like their food the 5 year old had a chees pizza the crunch was weird to him and the black stuff on the bottom from the wood fire oven freak him out he pick off all the chees and pretend to eat the pizza all while attempt to avoid the black stuff 

the 3 year old had the grill chees and he sort of enjoy it bare they use two type of chees and press it in a panini which is a littl high brow for someon who still sometim pee his pant 

overal i sort of enjoy it but would not returnwhen we were in az for our mini vacay we reli heavili on yelp for our meal  my kid realli want to eat pho after a day of eat burger and pizza  we chose pholici just for it name  the name is quit dare isnt it be from so cal we are quit spoil when it come to good vietnames food espcial pho  i realli didnt expect much from this place  i order their special clear noodl soup pho bo for my son  my dh order stir fri crunchi egg noodl and eggrol for appet  i didnt care for my noodl soup  the broth was bland not flavor  i could tast the msg but i cant be posit  it just didnt tast right  i couldnt even finish half of the bowl  their eggrol were ok better than expect  dh finish his dish but he could be veri hungri becaus he also finish my noodl soup  i would rate this place 4 star for it cleani and veri good servic  the food onli receiv 25 star  i round it up to 3 take their servic into consider6913

mi first visit at this herb box locat didnt know it was so much closer to where i live than that one at southbridg  decid to sit outsid sinc it was so noisi indoor and especi when the mister were on full blast outsid  the mister were both a bless and a curs while they did cool the area the water did have a certain odor to them a manag at anoth resto previous warn me not to park my car close to their mister sinc the water contain eros compound and i didnt want whatev was ad to the water to contamin my food and drink  order water and green tea with blackberri and jasmin essenc httpwwwyelpcombizphotostheherbboxscottsdale6selectacjm4qrtvri6og5qcqnsgacjm4qrtvri6og5qcqnsg and the blacken salmon blt

besid these few glitch in servic id otherwis give four star  mayb next visit will be better

it was lunchtim but by no mean pack with peopl so i wonder whi it was so noisiempti restaur on a saturday night in vega  high suspect  our waiter introduc himself and explain that the restaur is tapasstyl chines cuisin  in order to proper feed our group of 10 we would have to order 2 of everyth  

the culprit babi back rib w honey tamarind glaze 10  these were ok  noth special  spici thai shrimp with garlic basil lettuc wrap 10  a littl too salti for our like  calamari w serrano pepper 15 this was probabl one of my favorit  crispi with some heat to it  lemon chicken 21 passpasspass  last my other favorit of the even was steak serv over grill rice similar to grill onigiri  delici  

overal the food was just ok  for the price that we paid per item i expect better  servic could also have been better  consid the restaur was empti youd expect more attent from your serverexcus me

such was the theme of the night  tri to get good servic here is near imposs  server would walk past our tabl without even a second glanc caus us to have to scream and flag them down  ugh

w stop in for some drink and dessert after an earli dinner elsewher in nosco  after our experi im not sure that i would return for lunch or dinnerand it make me wari to tri north  the mini cannoli had a veri overpow lemon flavor  cannoli are my favorit dessertin my life i have had about 50 billion of them  my wed cake had cannoli fill  i have never had lemon flavor cannoli befor it was half gross and most disgust  the chocol and hazelnut cake was realli a browni in the shape of pie with a lot of whip cream and some hazelnut on top  not quit what i was expecting

th drink select is pedestrian as is the beer and wine select  then there is the water  holi cow i felt like i was drink a glass of the chemic my parent put in their pool  it smell aw and tast absolut disgust  i forc it down but oh man they need to adjust their water filter

it all open seat accord to the server we ran into on the way in  although when we made the move to a newli open tabl we were told it was reserv  what is it open or reserv  onc we got a spot on the patio we were treat to parent let their children run through the fountain at kierland at 10pm  i dont knowwhen i was 7 year old i wasnt run around crazi at 10pm at night  and i was most certain not in bar north after that have dessert and whatev  who bring a kid into a bar at 10pm on a saturday night 

then came time for the check  we wait so long for our server to pick it up that i actual had to go to the bar and pay for it there 

all in all i was complet unimpress  given the bizarr cannoli and the mediocr cake combin with the terribl servic im not sure i would go backth onli reason it get the third star is becaus the pick in north scottsdal are slimno where near as good as the one on 40th and camelback  and the seat it is so horribl for god sake get some more comfort chair  i work my ass off to be in shape so i dont have enough cushion for those hard chair  we had our mom night out there last saturday and my hubbi offer to drive me so i told him to pick me up after two hour  he told me i could stay longer  i told him no way my butt couldnt take it ani more i went to the chiropractor on monday i still have such a back ach from those horribl horribl chair  step down from the soap box the pizza piec i tast from my friend was ok and my other friend bare ate her muscl  the milano mule was good but didnt numb my back pain enoughbuh whaddaya mean you dont have chocol cactus p

overal a cool free place to check out while your in vegas

recommendask my cousin to take me to a froyo place and she mention uswirl sinc it was fair new lot of differ flavor like about 16 or 17 of them that plenti i was a bit overwhelm 

tast some sampl and went for the mango tart with mochi and strawberri  it was yummi but i do prefer mine to be a littl more tart 

self serv so put as much as you like decent price by the oz they had comfi couch and some game a great place to chill and hang out with friend and fam good froyo if your around hendersona place that special in musubi  wow  a hand of my guy friend mention such an idea to me and imagin their disappoint when i told them someon els beat them to the punch

w see this place all the time as we dine next door at swish  we decid to grab an order to go to see what the fuss was all about

tak advantag of their 808 special it includ a spam musubi mac salad two choic of entre and rice  from the pic it look like we got the krispi chicken krunch chicken roll in a season batter fri and top with a special glaze sauc and the samoan sami season corn beef and spinach bake in coconut milk  we werent exact sure how the order was go to come out and hope that it would be easi to eat later on  

when the order arriv to go it was quit a few box and we realiz this would not make it into the theater as we had hope  bring it home some of the samoan sami had alreadi come out of the box and was make a mess in the plastic bag  the present of the food was alright  i guess when you final assembl it altogeth it look a lot more appetizing

when it came down to it it was more of a bento box dinner with hawaiian influenc  i guess we were confus with it be a musubi place and thought the chicken and beef would be incorpor into a musubi of some kind

th spam musubi did tast good and the samoan sami had a nice tast to it too the chicken wasnt crunchi by the time we got home so it was okay

overal we just had differ expect from we actual got

pic postlist by get out mag as a hip noodl hous formal call sn asian kitchen asia is said to have a cool blackwhit decor motif with a sushi bar the restaur  describ as cozi  featur noodl dish from japan china vietnam malaysia and singapor also there live jazz music friday and saturday night 

so ask yourself would that tempt you it certain did me and at 7 pm on a saturday my sushilovin friend and i met here 

we were immedi shown to a corner booth and given menus our server was friend albeit a tad eccentr which we didnt mind her quick matteroffact manner was someth we couldnt decid if we like but that okay 

our first challeng was to pick out our drink the wine list is huge there also special they write on a big chalk board narrow it down to a few select took a few minut and my friend was disappoint to be told twice that they were out of the drink of her choic includ one of the sake on the menu bummer i went with the j lohr wildflow red blend and i didnt like it i told our server that i should have taken her suggest and gotten the writer block zin and i was hope i could send back the wildflow 

you dont like it
no sorri i dont
that okay i hate it it so popular though i dont understand why

uhm good to know for be honest about other wine she certain held her tongu when i place my order 

mi friend and i split the salmon salad app with fresh spinach and pine nut it was veri tasti the salmon was tempura but i didnt find it too fri to enjoy 

we then share the best of asia  3 piec each of yellow tail tuna and salmon light sear and flavor with garlic paprika ponzu and a jalapeno on top hot i had two piec and left the rest for my friend 

the big buddha roll which we share was veri veri tasti it was a littl spici but in that good way i enjoy this roll was doubl wrap with soy paper on the outsid and had crab meat avocado cream chees and salmon insid yum 

about 34 of our way through dinner the server brought out my new glass of wine uhm ok 

sorri i total forget
but at least you rememb my friend remark 

as for the atmospher it can onli be sum up this way airport 

i got the feel that if i walk out the front door id be insid an airport termin head to whatev gate i need to be at to make my flight the interior of the place like my friend point out seem to be the type of place that you cram thing insid a space that dont realli fit or belong bingo 

the sushi barkitchen take up the bulk of the space with a short sushi bar area to it immedi side there a few tabl scatter about as well as a few booth the decor is red black and white  get out was right about that i just would never call this place cozi they did turn down the light around 730 which help immens 

as for the music it was nice jazz the trio set up in a corner and play a few song sax drum guitar  what els do you need on our way out while the band was on break we learn they werent even a band and that they just kind of set up and play in an impromptu style regardless they were enjoy they didnt realli fit the motif of the restaur tho it was more of the airport restaur tri to be a cool loung with live music

when the bill came i was pleas to see our server did not charg me for the glass of wine i sent back i appreci that 

yet the bill was a bit too high for the type of serviceexperi my friend and i had here at asia 46 for 2 peopl ouch both the buddha roll and best of asia were 12 a piec the former total worth it the latter not the appet salad was 8 my friend sake was 2 bargain and my glass of realli great zin a new fave was 9 all in all it ad up but i definit would not go back to throw down that kind of money at a place that remind me of an airport restaur 

also while we were wait for the server to run my card i flick with my forefing what i thought was a piec of paper though in my mind it look like a tini tini fli turn out the piec of paper sprout leg and start to crawl across the tabl it was a bug ew gross 

this place has potenti but itll need a real overhaul to entic me to come back 

redeem traits
hug wine list almost too big it hard to decide
ful bar with beer select includ a coupl asian favorites
sak choic for cheap
big buddha roll that one of the best roll ive had  anywhere
l music  sure beat pop music blast overhead
clean bathroom with a vibrant green scheme  with sever men magazin to flip through weird eh and a pic of audrey hepburn on the wallthe menu select got my attent to tri this place for my month ladi lunch cowork  this place is insid the sheraton hotel and in the middl of the hotel open so you see all the busi traffic of peopl  

i order the az steak melt shave steak sirloin cook and top with asadero chees and regular fri  the sandwich was ok not much flavor  the fri were good  

the servic howev was great  but the food was just okthe food here was noth to rave about but the servic was superb and eat outsid by the pool under the hang light on a warm phoenix night was awesom 

like i said the food was just ok i had a veggi foccacia sandwich with sweet potato fri the sandwich was bland and the sweet potato fri were slight burnt the waitress was realli sweet and went in the back search for sauc and thing to make my food tastier and came out with a nice jalapeño aioli and some mapl syrup for the sweet potato fri tri it it great 

i ate with 6 other and they order a varieti of thing off the menu no one was particular impress with the food 

this was our second time here and both time they were sold out of the duck taco  the thing everyon want to tri the most the waitress said they were probabl go away for good sometim in the near futur 

we had two yelp checkin here and were offer 2 free dessert 1 free dessert with the purchas of 2 entre x 2  woot woot for yelp checkin deal we had the bread pud and the mocha toffe mous they were both ok  combin small bite of them creat a nice hotcold dessert experience

what save this place howev was our waitress and the ambianc our waitress was just the sweetest girl and genuin want to take care of us and she get lot of bonus point 

while the ambianc insid was noth special outsid it was semi magic the warm tshirt weather night the hang string light float abov our tabl the blue lit swim pool red lit jaccuzzi and the larg gas firepitfireplac behind us all creat a sort of mystic pseudo summer tropic vacat experi yes in phoenix

most of all great companitake a drive down flamingo road in las vega and you pass bymorton ruth chris fleme roy hawaiianand sexxpresso  we hit the brake liter to do a doubl take  so in lieu of starbuck we head here out of curios more than anything

sexxpresso boast the hottest coffe in vega and is a freestand structur that is drivethru onli  we drive up to the window and are immedi greet by a femal barista in a sexi referre costum who was comfort with our surpris wideey look  i order a soy cappuccino which was pretti good  less sweet than starbuck their menu has good a varieti of smoothi coffe drink and blend ice  

they arent open on sunday probabl becaus the femal barista were out danc the night befor at their other job  onli in vega would this place work  worth a pit stop just for kickwe came here on a coupl time on a friday night and had their prime rib ayc for 1296 we use the caisno guid bogo

 the buffet is veri simpl american mexican salad bar pizza soup and grill 
 the best part about this buffet and the onli reason whi we come here is just for friday night for their prime rib

 i dont touch much of the other stuff it more like ayc prime rib and burger haha 
 chicken soup is veri salti 
 compar to feast buffet feast is better 
 1199 fri sat is for blue ace member 
 close at 9pm friday they start clean the buffet at 915 and it close at 930pmwith a name like cheeburg time 2 you dont have to guess what their specialti is  what most diner in the area dont know is that cheeburg cheeburg is actual a chain with over 50 locat  

walk in newbi will be surpris by the 50sinspir diner atmospher  their menu definit take some time to navig but youll get the hang of it

burg  their main focus and what everyon realli come for  you can have your meat cook to your like medium medium well well and in various size 55 oz 7 oz 10 oz 14 oz  appar they have their own farm where the beef come from  what make them over the top is the number of top avail  thing like sundri tomato avocado and artichok heart are onli a sampl of their 25 plus top select  the husband went for the semiseri 7 oz for 699  with nine type of chees to choos from he went for the pepper jack chees and a fair amount of top  melissa g went for the classic 55 oz wrap for 679  she also ad a few top too

if it not meat you crave portabello mushroom and veggi burger and wrap are also avail  salad are also hearti on the top with over 25 choic to choos from  i went for the portabello wrap for 799  they offer white or whole wheat wrap and you get a signatur sauc to dip your wrap in  my wrap was okay perhap there so much stuff go on that it hard to enjoy the actual tast of the wrap itself

w couldnt resist their famous fri  ring and want to go for the best of both basket regular order 589 but the waitress dissuad us by say it was huge and we should realli get a half 469  appar she underestim our crave for fri food and we end up order up anoth basket of fri small 259  medium 359  larg 459  we werent too fond of the onion ring but we did like the fri  they also offer five signatur sauc so we did the adventur flight of three 249  sinc two of us order wrap we end up tri all five  creami chees zesti horseradish creami jalapeno sweet pepper and garden veget  we overdid it with the sauc and mayb should have just chosen one for our fri  they werent anyth special unfortun  

but the real winner is their milkshak select  with over 37800 possibl combin you can build ani kind of milkshak you want  the waitress did point out that onc you get past the three top combin there an excess of syrup as most of the top are syrupbas so be sure to ask the staff what top are concret versus syrup  i went for the oreo green mint cooki dough and heath bar combin and it was realli good  the husband went for the pina colada and berri berri combo and his was pretti good too  melissa g has chocol banana peanut butter with rees piec  they serv them up in two size  half 359 or regular 499  

servic was okay the waitress were super friend in the begin but slack off a bit as more busi arriv and our section was left empti  we were seat in the back section although they end up close it off and seat everyon els in the front

when it come down to it we paid over 50 for dinner and that was not includ tip  pretti expens meal for a parti of three at a diner  for those who know what top to pick you can get a better bang for your buck  but if you prefer the no frill on your burger this place is not for you  wed go back for the shake and fri but not for the ring burger or wrapalthough i order my burger medium it came out dri and tasteless the top list is great but as mani have mention the extra charg here border on ridicul  when im order 6 worth of friesonion ring you cant throw in some sauc for free

th shake we creat for 549 mind you was realli delici but i havent met a shake i didnt love

i can see how the strongest argument for a place like this would be price and conveni  im an asshol so i look at it as a type of competit eat environ where we are all race to see who can make the highest plate tower i realiz im given a substanti advantag be as im the onli who even know the contest is go on but it still a challeng what can i say i enjoy challeng myself it say so on my resum but i digress

th food is okay the nigiri is thin but it also 1 for two piec so im not go to complain the roll are basic but tasti you onli get 4 piec on the plate which is good for just one or two peopl becaus you can tri stuff without commit to a whole roll it basic sushi for beginn roll around on the conveyor belt and though i hear that you can special request thing i havent tri to do so yet the highest price plate is 2 so im not even sure someth like uni or ikura is an option though it would rock my world up if it was

anoth fun thing about the belt is that it not all sushi dure my visit there were littl bag of trail mix piec of cheesecak a can of v8 wtf and littl japanes soda all circl around wait to get pick up i like this concept and feel it should be expand to includ shot beer yoohoo and those likmaid thing the ice cream man use to sell those thing were so good

al in all the food probabl wont blow you away but it fun and funni and you feel like you put one over on everyon when you eat 10 plate of sushi and your bill is onli 1350 includ the can of v8 aoktarget is target and this target is about as sub par as the rest but let be honest we all go to target and reli on it for the discount price and essenti we need howev this target stand out for me becaus of the groceri section of the store and most import the produc and meat i was pleasant surpris with the meat select here and not just regular cut of meat but preprepar select with garnish chees etc they even had bacon wrap steak i think i might start frequent target for not just my household need and bath product but for my groceri and meal instead mayb not all the time but it definit worth keep on the list for foodanoth thai restaur experi  lunch special are the way to go i tell you

first off panna thai restaur look a bit more upscal than your averag thai joint which i think reflect in the price as well

w walk in to a relat empti restaur on a weekday  as the waiter brought us to our tabl he immedi ask if we had ani coupon befor we even sat down  we did not but appar they do have a lot float around and are a bit restrict about how they are use  i think they are also on restaurantcom too

lunch special are avail everyday from 11 am to 4 pm  they all includ a fri wonton fresh salad steam rice and soup of the day  you can substitut fri rice or brown rice for 1 more  

start off with miso soup  interest choic 

i went for the yellow curri lunch special with tofu thai yellow curri and thai herb serv with jasmin rice 695   fri tofu and potato were the main compon of my dish  raw bell pepper decor the top  i wish they cook the veggi with the curri though  the fri wonton had pea and carrot in it  a bit differ than what you normal find insid one of those thing  the biggest problem i had was with the rice  it was mushi  too much water in the cooker  it never a good sign when the rice get mess up 

the husband tri out their garlic short rib lunch special deep fri short rib saute with garlic and black pepper sauc serv with jasmin rice 695  it was a tasti dish and lot of flavor but then again it deep fri and it sound like it would be tasty

overal we found panna thai to be just an okay experi  there are definit a few other thai restaur in the neighborhood that has a foot up on select tast and pricefirst off let give some prais to the concept a vegan vietnamesestyl kosher restaur that the coolest thing ive heard sinc someon explain nonstick fri pan to me unfortun the servic can be a bit slow and a bit weird but youv got to give them some credit for open a place like this

most of the dish are compos of ricenoodl steam veggi and one of their vegan meat like chicken beef rib fish etc dous in sauc it awesom sauc saucesom but it pretti much negat a lot of the healthier aspect of the dish whi not wait to add those extra calori with some vegan carrot or chocol cake instead as far as recommend the lemongrass tofu roll and green papaya salad are both light fill and fresh tast dish if your a sauceohol opt for the tasti bbq citrus spare rib or soy fish in a clay pot

for those of you who dont want to read ani of that refer to the short  sweet version below

concept hell yeah
servic weird
select of meat awesome
vegan dessert much appreciated
dish vari  satisfactory
sauc too heavy
overal 35 star ill probabl go back at some pointhmmm ever eat some cool treat and sudden realiz your treat tast like cold not a flavor like a swir deserti yogurt mayb 

i have tri paciugo twice onc alon and onc with my kid  love the varieti avail although it seem a bit pricey at 399 for a medium  tonight with kid we all had medium which was fine becaus we did not realli ador our gelato 

flavor tonight seem to have okay name like panna cota 
wed cake  turtl cheesecak  monkey busi 
peanut butter  eww creativ  but after start to eat it  it seem the tast did not shine through my mouth began to not regist flavor just cold  hmmm

now will i go back  sure   i love a cold treat and this place is right by 
harkin norterra i will be back just cuz  but with dippin dot right there as well and a yogurt place they may miss out on some busi with their high price and unmemor flavorsome gouddda pizzzza though expect were high so ehh

ingredi are fresh kept simpl all about minim 

classic thin crust dough twas good but didnt blow me away although ive never been one for thin pizza unless it is iansthey do their crust so right crispi yet doughi so good dough here was a bit on the gummi side if that a thing 

we tried
pizza bianca  oliv oil basil garlic fresh mozzarella
pizza rossoverd  basil prosciutto parmesan arugula mozzarella
custom pizza of mozzarella parmesan fennel sausage

also order the capres salad  tomato basil housemad fresh mozzarella oliv oil sea salt
delicious

not sure which pizza was my favorit all were pretti aight flavor wise 
their pizza are on the smaller size so if you are starv you should order six of them and you could probabl polish them off just fineexaggeration

il be back to see if they cant impress me more next timeunimpress though my assess may be inaccur here why

it was a rather brisk and windi januari day id say zero degre out in all honesti and the chocol were just too beauti that i knew i need to get a great pictur and this of cours entail natur lightingyou know the drill

sooo here me sit on a snowcoat bench hold my littl truffl tri to strike the perfect angl with my smartphon and for starter the shop is situat in the center of the outdoor hilldal mall so there were plenti of passersbi question my saniti buuuut i need this pictur so who care  

the real action began when this crazi strong gust of wind swoop down send my truffl fli in the air and into a graycolor snowbank booo 

this didnt stop me i still need that pictur and mayb a bite five second rule right inde 

i dug my way through that mass of taint snow and delic extract my smore truffl took my pictur took a bite somewhat uncertainlyon to discov it was just aoksunday morn roll around and a group of us head down town and yelp mobil new place for brunch mazi came up and the review boast mimosa and bloodi for 3 buck so we decid to tri someth new
a we arriv we notic there is a decent size patio outsid but all the tabl were in the sun so we opt for the insid asid from be a littl loud the set up is decent the space is small and intim with a good energet vibe
w order the 3 mimosa and were not disappoint by the champagn to oj ratio in our drink id give 4 star for the drink alon they also had 5 sangria that were delici not too sweet and you could tell they use a decent wine
our server was a bit forget but nice all the same im bump my rate down to 3 star as the food was pretti disappoint i dont mind pay 9 buck for funki french toast but what i was serv were two tini slice of raisin bread and noth els no fruit on the side noth it was good all 4 bite of it but compar it to other place fez dick acacia and it pale in comparison i was still hungri so i help my friend finish her omlett not impress and order a 3 fruit kabob a 6 inch stick of fruit 
ive heard the rest of the menu is good here and i would like to tri it i would also glad go back for the sangriamaiz it will do and the garlic bread was good are the two main slogan i can think of for maizes

i realli like the ambianc of the insid i like the bar the wine bottl display the tabl where everyon munch on regular size sandwich and the patio look at the light rail is pretti sweet

if i live around here it would be an easi go to place for happi hour wgreat beer wine select and cheap burger for the carniesit has a no nonsens charm that i cant seem to replic in colour scheme except you could take a hipster and your dad hereand that is pretti rare around phoenix

i have a limit palat for american food be vegetarian lactos intoler but will to eat egg and some seafood if no meatchees free dish most american style place mean fri or salad big whoop but i went for the simpl garden salad wthe side of garlic bread and just a water it was realli good that was it am i gonna go out of my way for the garlic bread and garden salad here umno

th servic was just kind of weird nice but sometim i felt i was have communic breakdown with all the host server and the random older owner that ran out whot sauc for mr k when he was almost done whis egg there were a lot of rais eyebrow exchang at the tabl and i even whisper was i realli weird did i not make sens and it kept happen like a waitercustom vortex where each parti think the other one mean someth els at all time 

so onc again maiz it will do and the garlic bread was goodwell let see it is 425 am so it was yesterday i went to mazi for lunch with a coupl of friend 

had not been befor but will go back 

i like the bright of the place and easi seat it is not cute or pretti but rather haphazard in style 

i had the bluburg and a cup of split pea soup oh and french fri 

the soup if it had been place in front of me and i did not know what it was split pea would not have come to mind oh do not get me wrong it was veri tasti and i enjoy all the same it was sweet and that in it self is odd for split pea it has a varieti of ingredi one usual doe not find although i would order it again becaus as i said it was good 

the burger was cook as i ask and was just fine the blue chees was a bit weak in flavour i did not have to spit it out so i was just spiffi doodl 

i was told the fri were good were they or were they just salti i am not sure but then again i am not a french fri person for the most part 

the water was fab 

the servic was slow for us anyway three set of folk came well after us and were half through their meal when we got our my eat mate notic this more than i and were rather put off about it i on the other hand just did not care 

i suspect i will be back at some point in time assum both mazi and i surviv the futur 

below it is ask if this place is good for kid i say a resound no keep your stinki noisi kid away from me 

it is also ask about take out yes take the kid out 

and as for attir pleas be kind and dress few of us could show up nake and still be abl to hold the food down 

i think i am donei have been on a quest to find the best fish n chip in cenpho  
i had heard they had a tuesday fish fri at maizi and realli love the place so i had to give it a try
four smallish piec of fish a stack of chip with malt vinegar homemad tartar sauc and a coupl of hush puppi  oh and a side of slaw
i think the batter was a littl bit much  hush puppi were dry
for 13 i had expect more  it onli 825 at turf and way more fishoh how the mighti have fallen or at least they have at this locat

al in all just a disappoint experia new bbq shack offer a varieti of differ sandwich combo plate rib salad wing and more you can also buy whole famili size meal and chop bbq pork or chicken by the pound

appar by the name the rib must be their specialti though i opt for the smother pork sandwich which was chop pork with slaw on a toast bunse pic out of the 12 differ side i chose mac and chees 

i wasnt impress with the mac and chees it was too process for my like but i did like the sandwich the meat had a nice flavor and the slaw was crisp and refreshing

i would like return to have that sandwich again 

im gonna go with 3 star for now until i have a chanc to tri some more item but all in all it was a good experienceservic by friend staff in a clean industri shack dine area 

look like they have a happi valli and glendal locat tooso in my quest for a new lunch spot i drag my cowork and his wife to shane we were greet at the counter and the menu was so big we had to step asid to read it all we final were readi to order our lunch

i opt for the shack sampler which come with 14 rack of rib 2 chicken tender  14 lb pull pork with 2 side i chose green and macaroni and chees all this was deliv to my table

th food was pretti darn ok the rib were fall off the bone and the sauc wasnt too terribl candi sweet the chicken tender were well season and toss in a hot wing sauc that wasnt veri hot the pull pork was moist and tender and cover in the same sauc as the rib the green were meh they were sweet someth im not use to i was hope for someth more smokysalti the macaroni and chees was not the kind that big mama use to make it was tasti but not homemade

i was delight to see that they have sweet tea yay that was a major plus for them i want to tri their peach cobbler so i went back up to the counter to order some ok i know some peopl are go to disagre with me but i love my cobbler doughi here the catch the dough has to be tasti shane won on that tip too i love that the peach werent too terribl sweet and there was a good amount of dough in the bowl 

i plan on hit up shane again for anoth semisouthern fix it wasnt wonder it was aok if you want wonder youll have to hit my parent kitchen in spring texa in the meantim hit shane for a tastthis burger king is in mccarran after you pass through secur it my default meal choic when im strand here

it tradit for me to have a light lunch or dinner here befor fli out i even impuls got onion ring here onc after arriv in vega yes this burger king is reliabl but the sad truth is that airlin food suck a big fat one anyon els notic that this burger king alway seem to be expens and it not just the sale tax talk it not quit price goug but it come close for fast food thank good they take credit cards

for mani it easi to succumb to burger king greasi good  the other busi in this termin dont offer much anyway  tcbys im look at youwalk by a coupl of time head over to saddl ranch but this time i said let do it  be a sushi snob  i was happi to tri a new place

aft be sat in what seem to be the norm of red and black decor  was sat right next to a server station  howev next to the window which was pleasant 

food i order the pyrami roll which got me with the yuzu tartar sauc and also a spici tuna roll although generic i think it say alot  it like a chef cook chicken you should alwasi get it right the tuna roll was way too larg and had to be cut in half in order for me to fit it in my mouth waaay to much rich howev the pyramid roll was fantast left me want more

booz time i had a tokyo mojito with cucumb it tast exact like you would think noth special  but refreshing

servic i must say i have had way better it was a simpl  someth to drink  what would you like to eat and  thank you at the end veri cut and dri so bad no good no

overal i would go back if i want sushi and was at westgat but i wouldnt be sit at home think  oh let go there tonighti just had dinner with a group friend and with all of us be as origin as we are we all decid to be cheap and get the 475 california quesadilla littl did we know we all ask for chicken and when the bill came for the tabl we were all charg 1195 for the chicken quesadilla how were we suppos to know our waiter was the nicest guy in the world but he gave us littl tip on what food to choose

custom servic wise great peopl who love to help but you would have to ask come to this restaur with an extrem empti stomach becaus two peopl can share one plate it seemnice place for what a pizza place has to offer

895 for a balsam grill chicken salad that can feed 2 if your order pizza etc you can get the 1495 plate mayb that feed 4

995 for the margherita roma tomato garlic fresh basil
tasti good ask for extra garlic didnt seem to make it on this order or it could be the garlic chees bread 595 was head  shoulder more garlici so the pizza pale in comparison

back again

kid war cell phone war wtf
salad was nice again
thia chicken pizza was good indeed
of all thing to order someon got a pepperoni look like shit kinda pool up some oil yay lunch tomorrow 

i guess if you stick with thing that you cant get at pizza hut your ok here duck taco for onenext time next timeour experi here just didnt come togeth  sometim when that happen at a restaur it hard to identifi what exact was not right  of a piec noth realli stood out as poor

w met christin o and myle m for a late lunch  were run a few minut late  latitud 8 face arizona ave even though the address is on boston  the front is huge window  as we drive by we can see christin and myle sit at a tabl face the window  all alon  the place is desert except for the two of them

a coupl minut later we were seat with them  the place is eerili dead  i dont think our server is normal a server and that could be part of the problem  she was rather pushi tri to sell appet and had a hard time take no for an answer on soup

w order chicken satay and veri interest sound yellow curri crab cake  the portion seem small for the satay  there were 3 skewer and the morsel of chicken on each amount to littl more than 2 good size bite  the crab cake were decent size and there were also three  both the crab cake and the satay were tasti but did not stand out

for the entre we share pad thai pineappl fri rice spici eggplant stir fri and panang curri with flank steak  i felt the portion were small on everyth except the rice   the qualiti of the food was good overal with nice curri and fresh ingredi  despit that the food didnt wow  

latitud 8 has a nice trendi atmospher but the food just fell a littl short when stack against some of the other thai restaur i have visit in and around phoenix and therefor onli merit 3 stari have to agre with jim w and jasmin c on this one latitud eight is not that great i can see whi a lot of peopl in phoenix wouldnt like this place it small portion with big price tag serv in a trendi asian atmospher arent exact par for the cours in the valley of the sun howev i dont dislik latitud eight for the reason other might dislik it come from the sf bay area and have work in a modern vietnames restaur for over a year im use to and a big fan of asian small plate place with zen chic decor so you might askwhat dont you like about latitud eight 

ill tell you the food just wasnt that flavor or innov in my mind the onli reason to choos an upscal small plate thai place instead of an authent no frill thai place is to have food that use differ flavor combin or cook techniqu unfortun for latitud eight noth i tri with the except of one dish made me want to go there instead of nearbi swadde or sala thai locat in no phoenix 

the chicken satay was just that a chicken satay the chicken was tender enough but the peanut sauc was realli typic and actual a lot sweeter than an authent peanut sauc should be the yellow curri crab cake were a slight better attempt to combin flavor not found in typic thai restaur but the execut fell short in my opinion the crab was good qualiti but the curri flavor was way too strong 

for entre we sampl the pad thai pineappl fri rice spici eggplant stir fri and panang curri with flank steak the pad thai was no better than pretti much ani ive had here in phoenix and the spici eggplant was incred disappoint with a bland brown sauc i prefer the eggplant at thai lahna by a mile the pineappl fri rice was also decent but not memor the onli dish i thought was outstand was the panang curri with the flank steak the curri was incred rich and flavor with just the right amount of spice and not too much coconut milk 

outsid of the fact that the food was a bit overpr for how uninnov and bland it was on the whole i was also incred turn off by the way the restaur dealt with our lunch reserv when the four of us initi decid to check latitud eight out their websit state that they were open at noon on saturday for lunch howev by the time i call to make a reserv for the saturday of thanksgiv break the site state that they open at 2pm on saturday a time that make sens if your tri to captur the octogenerian crowd or big citi tourist who like to eat at all hour of the day but not when your locat in chandler arizona 

that be said though we realli want to tri the place so we made a reserv for 2pm as jim w said in his review when we show up the place was empti dead like a graveyard and not a singl other person show up to eat in the 15 hour we were there our server also wasnt a regular employe and didnt know much about the menu or process credit card which she told us up front which i assum mean that they knew that it wouldnt be crowd at all so whi be open 

latitud eight realli need to take a hard look at it menu and decid how they can make their food more uniqu and innov they also need to close at lunch or open earlier i will still make the drive to chandler to eat at swadde but i doubt ill give this place anoth chanci have heard that they have start a kaiseki cours so i have been curious and want to tri it out but given that my last experi here was mere aok i have drag my feet until recent but here are my thought after tri it out  

first of all kaiseki liter mean stone in the bosom  this origin from zen buddhist monk keep a warm stone in the bosom to endur cold and hunger dure their train as they were not allow to eat much in the afternoon  occasion they are allow to eat small portion of rice poridg and such small meal origin the name kaiseki as someth to wade off hunger

kaiseki then transform to offer dure formal tea ceremoni and then after hundr of year it has evolv  into what we consid kaiseki ryori now which is a multi cours formal dinner offer almost eclus in ryoutei  as it inherit a spirit of the tea ceremoni the focus is on servic and offer the best that can be offer at the time to serv the custom the spirit of ichigo ichi  

as i consid raku as sort of a highend izakaya like place and certain not a ryoutei i was curious as to how they can pull off a kaiseki cours but here is how it went  i had to make the reserv at least 3 day in advanc and the choic were 10 or 15cours dinner and i was told to expect it to take at least 3 hour  as i had to arrang for a babi sitter i just went for a 10 cours meal

in japan ryoutei or highend japanes restaur someth like kiccho come to mind serv their guest in privat tatami room which isnt quit possibl here but at least they led us to a privat roomlik space toward the back of the restaur which is nice  it was wall off except for the entranc part so it is a bit more than a booth to give us some privacy

w order some bottl water from japan as well as a small bottl of sake as my wife and i dont drink that much and the cours start with yuzu flavor sake aperitif and then
1 hotaruika firefli squid sumisoae
2 larg plate with asparagus okaki salmon with egg yolk cornpotato grill egg plant grill duck yamaimo mouss and foi gras egg custard  
3 squid and ikura with uni sauce
4 soup with chicken tsukun and cherri blossom leaf
5 sashimi of hatsugatsuo earli season bonito and sayori japanes half beak
6 miso glaze grill huedai star snapper
7 fri aji japanes jack mackerel in dashi with eringi mushrooms
8 babi abalone
9 kobe beef steak on hot stone
10 shima aji namerou with rice and takana stripe jack tartar
11 desert of fresh chees mouss 

whew  it sound like a lot and it is a lot but that took us more than 3 hour  was it good  yes  am i thrill to go back and tri it again  no  

perhap that is the reason whi i live here and despit all the rave i hear and read about raku this was my second visit  

i just think that it was a strech to say it nice to call it kaiseki  there are a few thing that bother me and distract from the meal  

there was a group of young kid wear basebal cap with baggi short and wife beater talk veri loud drop fbomb left and right who were sit relat close to us  although we were in a semipriv boothlik space this was distract  do i blame them  no becaus as i said befor i consid raku to be a highend izakaya and not a ryotei  howev this is not quit the set that i find appropri to serv kaiseki which has zen buddhism and tea ceremoni in origin  it has to be in a seren zenlik space and raku is not it

in ani kaiseki there must be a balanc of food from sealandmountain  as you can see on the menu 7 out of the 10 ingredi are seafood and the balanc is hopeless lacking

on of the veri import aspect of serv kaiseki food is ma or space  3 and a half hour for this meal  my wife and i felt that this meal drag way way too long and the consider for ma was absolut lacking

on other concern was that my wife has a food allergi to shrimpsclam  i was actual surpris that they didnt ask me that when i made the reserv and i forgot to mention it but when i mention it at dinner i was told that oh we dont do kaiseki for peopl with allergiesi told them that ok as i will be happi to eat her shrimp and clam and the onli thing that she couldnt eat happen to be abalon no big deal  howev this stray so so far away from the spirit of kaiseki which should inherit the spirit of ichigoichi which is at the heart of sadou or tea ceremoni as well a zen buddhism  

in summari i have a veri difficult time call this meal kaiseki  the food was good although not exact great either and kaiseki is not onli about the food but more import the experi and as a whole the experi was lack and it was not someth that i am yearn to go back for moresmall tini place that you have to make reserv for way in advanc my mom made a reserv for us 2 week in advanc and if your latewithin 15 minut they will give your tabl to somebodi els 

locat in a small tini corner in chinatown we got there about 10 minut befor our reserv time but we were assist to sit down right away the food itself take quit a long time to arriv we were there for almost 2 hour it took about a good 45 minut for the first plate to come out 

i actual prefer shin sen gumi yakitori over this place the tast isnt as strong as their but overal it pretti good 

popey salad 8 spinach and bacon main decent good a littl too salti but a good salad nonetheless

asparagus okaki 5 delici super crunchi and it actual tasti cheesi nom nom 

juici fri chicken 9 not a favorit didnt have too much flavor to it and it was strang chewi slight warm as well 

ice fish 850 frown as i write this i dont like fish and i dont like see multipl tini fish fri up whole i ate like 3 d no gusta

agedashi tofu 11 pretti good i just didnt like the fish egg insid but overal it was a good and flavor dish

momo chicken thigh 275 each err it was a littl too pink for my like and it was kind of fatti it was okay 

tsukun 350 each shin sen is much tastier this one come as like a drumstick and i had to keep ad more togarashi not enough sauc 

harami kobe beef skirt 750 each delici come with grunchi garlic chip mmm super tasty

yakionigiri 500 come with 2 it wasokay lol

scallop with soy sauc 700 not sure how this tast didnt eat this one

asparagus with bacon 300 come with 3 piec pretti good 

asahi 700

umeshu 1200 super delicious

overal the flavor was almost there and i didnt think it was the greatestmy boyfriend discov raku while research the top restaur in las vega we were abl to score a late reserv for 6 on a saturday night at 12am we were told that group of more than 5 are requir to select the omakas menu for 75 per person 

i was expect to be blown away by the food here after read numer review of the restaur the verdict the food was definit overhyp we had a good meal but noth realli stood out 

we start with a tofu appet where the star of the dish was the green tea salt which you can purchas here other cours includ a whole fri fish in broth various charcoal bbq skewer soup and assort sashimi all of the ingredi were highqual but noth realli blew me away 

when it came time for dessert all we got was some fruit sorbet im sorri but for 75 per person i would have expect someth better green tea creme brule anyon overal i might consid come back and order a la cart item from the menu as i saw some interest offer my advic  steer clear of the omakas menua bit pricey but the sandwich and bakeri good are fresh made with an emphasi on local grown ingredi there a wide array of sandwich to choos from rang from the farm garden sandwich to the pull pork sandwich the price are around 10 dollar for sandwich or salad the salad themselv are premad and on ice in the area right next to the drink station

for those that are vegetarian there are 3 differ full salad and 3 differ sandwich to choos from all with distinct flavor ive tri the marin portabella which was decent everyth was veri fresh and the bread was high qualiti but i would have like to tast more balsalm vinegar in the mushroom for more flavor the whole sandwich was a good portion that will leav you full for lunch

i tri a slice of pecan pie 425 it seem like it made with fresh shell pecan but bewar when you chew appar they can get a bit careless with their nutshel becaus i got a larg piec of shell in my pie minus one star i could have broken a tooth on that shell

th main reason to come here is to enjoy the ground it a realli nice place to picnic and get away from the hustl and bustl of the citi to relax unwind and enjoy the beauti of natur you can also bring your dog here which is also a plusafter a subpar rubio experi at anoth locat last week i decid to give this locat a tri becaus i was crave mexican food for lunch  i ordered

th food came out in a short period of time and despit be busi the cashier rememb who i was and took the food out to my tabl instead of call my namegreat service

th chicken taco was veri good  the steak burrito especi was even better  the steak was juici and full of flavor  all of the ingredi were fresh and compliment each other  of cours i got the spiciest salsa from the salsa bar to eat with the food  i love their salsa bar

return factor  70had an earli morn flight to philadelphia this morn  didnt get a chanc to grab a bite to eat befor i left the hous so i stop by flatbreadz

i decid to get 2 toast sesam seed bagel wcream chees  i was pleasant surpris to see that the bagel were pretti fresh  they toast it just right toonot too burnt but not undercook either  i would have rate them 4 star but the cream chees was a fluffi cream chees and didnt have much tastemust have been fatfre or someth like thatwhich is a bummer becaus i like fullflavor cream cheese

th employe were friend and the place was clean

wil i return  if im in the a gate area surei give pink spot three star for a mix experi 

the boy had a vanilla milkshak that was out of this world delici but my coffe ice cream tast weird and left me cold no pun intend it pretti sad when the best part of the ice cream cone is the outofabox mass produc cone 

i am not a big ice cream person anyway so i suppos one could assum that my experi was direct relat to that but i dont think it was the staff had no idea what they were do note train staff prior to put them on shift all by themselv and i thought the price were a littl on the steep side for the qualiti of the product 

they do howev get a few bonus point 
1 for a fair cute decor
1 for have chocol cover frozen banana i hate the thing but it isnt someth youll find at most ice cream jointi am slight confus as to what this place is
i it a coffe shop yes
i it an ice cream parlor wellyes
i it an antechamb for the hair salon upstair kinda
seem the pink spot giggl is tri to be a few thing at onc and vagu succeed at those goals
i like the pink spot giggl for a number of reasons
location
convenience
ambience
selection
in all honest it isnt the best coffe shop that the area offer but it anoth option and that my friend is a corner stone of capit consum choice
now i wont be make the pink spot giggl my local haunt that spot belong to lola and i would never cheat on my belov tranni but for those special night when i get the strang urg for simultan brain freez and a scald tongu ill go down on the pink spotgigglmy buddi and i came here one afternoon to get some ice cream  i got 3 scoop in a waffl bowl  i got a scoop of salt butter caramel a scoop of almond butter crunch and a scoop of peanut butter chip  this ice cream has the same textur of breyer  more ici than creami  it was freak delici though and all 3 flavor were uniqu in their own way  it was 625 i believ after the waffl bowl was thrown in there  it was tasti  my buddi tri the sweet corn ice cream  i had a tast of it and it was surpris good  he also pick up a bag of bacon brittl  it was just oki thought it would be like crunchi toffe with bacon in it  it was soft like caramel almost with bacon in it  overal it was a good stop and their ice cream flavor are a littl crazi but they all work out somehowstop in here for a dessert snack today join by mike c robyn n  arlin b  i went with a waffl cone of almond butter crunch ice cream  it was delici but did run near 4 which seem like a lot for a golf ball size treat     came here for a littl cinco de mayo lunchact today it not my first time at this salti senorita locat so i pretti much knew what to expect 

as a solo diner i just pull up a bar stool and sat at the bar servic was actual phenomen i didnt catch the bartend name but she was awesom extrem attent and friend 

i arriv a bit earlier around 1130am as i expect it could get busi today i chose salti for two reasons
a it cinco and i want some good mexican grub
b i want to earn some frequent flyer point in the dine reward program

first of all sinc it been a while ive been here they have a new menu it a larg onepag alot of thing seem to be miss like chimichanga no chimi but the bartend told me they could make ani burrito a chimi 

and 199 for chip and salsa i thought those use to be free sheesh 

oh well im expens this meal anyway so i got the chip  salsa diet coke and the grill chicken burrito 

the burrito was fabul and fresh tast on the side was a larg serv of refri bean but i was rather surpris to see a 999 burrito be serv in a cheap red basket kind of a turnoff a 10 burrito deserv a plate 

i ask the server if that was now customari to serv their food in basket  but she said it was just for cinco appar it make it easier for them to clean up 

i can understand mayb later dure the drink hour  but not dure lunchtime

food was decent servic was awesom im give 3 star becaus i feel as though theyr nickel  dime custom by charg for chip  salsa and put 10 burrito in red basket boofriday night mete a sever friend for a drink they had a live bad and the weather was great 

that was the good of it 

the server while nice was slooow and the drink were weeeeak the price are averag which make a bad combo 

onc the band stop and the hous music start it pretti much kill the fun 

was not a fan of the food last time but neglect to eat this timei did not plan to eat here so i had not read ani review prior to go  i dont think mcgee is near as bad as some of the review ive sinc readat least my experi was not  is it an authent irish pub  no but last time i check were in the middl of the desert and it 110 degre outsid  everi place ive been to at marketplac is pretti commerci anyway  

we had lunch this afternoon  not too busi at all  the server came befor i had a chanc to see the drink menu  i ask if they had ani cider  like a cider beer she ask  well i dont mean appl juic  she suggest someth i agre to  sinc im not a beer drinker i didnt recogn the name of the beerprob becaus it wasnt cider  which by the way there is cider on their drink menu  i was not impress she didnt know that but overal servic was good

but in ani case we order yorkshir pud for an appet  my husband and i both enjoy it  i order fish and chip  the fish is haddock  mayb it not the best fish youv ever had but it was cook nicelynot overdon at all  my husband had a shepherd pie which he also had no complaint about  i did like that both our entre came with the option to order a smaller size  i wish more restaur offer this especi this time of year when the leftov would spoil by the time you made it to your car which might be 12 mile away given the park situat here

they seem to have some nice drink special on differ day of the week  it also a decent size space if you have a larger group  a pleasant experiwe have been here a few time now sorri to say this was the worst we have experienced
it was a tuesday night about 830pm not too busi when we got there we had to say hello to the hostess she just said later how you do 2 she never said follow meor is this tabl alright just put our menus down and said enjoy

when our server rachel came upsh was alrightsh brought us our drink right away  we wait quit awhil for our food the manag final brought it out to us
then ask if we need anyth both of our drink were empty
w ask for refillsrachel brought them about 15 min or more later she came by to ask if we like our food my girlfriend had order her well doneit was still veri pink in the middl they offer to re do she declin we all know never send food back she said no it is ok i just want you to see it is not cooked
min was cook all the way through even though i had order medium

anyway then the manag came by again though did not introduc himself as the manag at ani time we found out from rachel that he was again he offer a re cook she declin and said no it is fine i will take it home to the dog

h offer to take it off the bill
w still never got anoth refil of drink we were die of thrist so could hard wait to get home and get some water or out to the car where we had water bottles
lot of mill around by the employeesbut not too much go on on the floor
w were realli disappoint about this visiti write this review with sad in my heart  i have been come to harem sinc it was coffe societi and befor they start serv hookahs

ther are no lock on the bathroom  embarass when a drunk from ra walk into the bathroom and take a coupl minut to figur out you arent a toilet

no soap in the bathroom  i need to clarifi this  the last 3 time i have been there no soap in the bathrooms

th coffe is still great the hot chocol was awesom the hookah was great but ive been come here for over 10 year  i can see the decline

buy soap put lock on the bathroom and bring back the good shisha you use to serv up

i tend to agre with my friend clint on this one 

food is decent but i think overpr the red velvet cup cake is good and make a great treat to bring to the offic or to bring for individu desert at a dinner party

slow but friend servic  friend becaus i use to be a regular 

i use to frequent this place but no more and here why

th owner would tell me that he had to keep his price point  a littl higher becaus all the ingredi were special like free rang chicken and that all produc was organic

on day i was go into costco and guess who i saw take out a larg commerci push cart the owner of red velvet cafe sonil tolani 

there on his cart was ton of chicken meat produc and other thing need to run a success restaur  that okay but dont give this bs that his ingredi are more cost becaus they are special 

bottom line again read clint review i think it is accur but read other less than five star review this owner is less than truth about other thing such as the calori content of their fooddessert
th menu claim all dessert are made in hous which immedi caught my attent i made sure to save room for the key lime pie it was light creami tangi and delici it was my favorit part of the meal

libations
w order a mojito dirti lou and a shiner the consensus at the our tabl after pass drink around so everybodi could tast them is that the top shelf mojito could have been better the flavor seem a littl mute the dirti lou could have been dirtier and the shiner while a littl out of place in a cuban restaur was realli good

food
w order the plantain appet ropa and two chicken dish the appet was so good and the spici black bean spread that came with the order was amaz both chicken dish were realli realli good the ropa was good it was serv luke warm  which might have distract from the flavors

service
w arriv around 8pm on a saturday night and it seem they were at the end of their dinner rush servic was friend albeit not as polish it seem that our glass were alway empti befor a refil was given

versus havana cafe

dessert babaloos
appet babaloos
lib tie
ropa havana cafe
atmospher havana cafe
specialti dish babalooi think i need to take my half star back

th food here has alway been pretti solid late ive notic that the portion have shrunk but the price havent we came for a late breakfast after hit the gym so we were pretti hungri i decid on a sandwich while my mom and fella got the chilaquil my meal was ok the place has never realli wow me with their food but it alway decent today was no except the onli problem was that my mom and fella food was oh so tini their chilaquil bare took up half of the plate so they were disappoint to say the least my sandwich was ok but i had hope for a littl more oomph flavorwis 

overal we had an ok meal but well probabl tri some other diner in the area when were feel extra hungri from our morn workouta place call honey pig how can you not like it  

weve been on a mission to tri out this korean restaur after pass by and see heap pile of food be grill in the center of the tables

last night with a parti of five we final had a chanc  we knew right away it was best to get a combo  so 2 honey pig combo for 5999 it was  it meant for about three to four peopl so we figur we could add more later on  it come with korean pork beef prime neck flesh of pork hot babi octopus seafood bean past soup fri rice and either 1 bottl of soju or korean beer

aft put in our order the waiter came back with ice korean tea  this was actual the first time i have ever seen the tea serv on ice and it was veri refresh  someth so nice need to be serv in tall glass instead of small regular tea cups

about nine differ banchan was brought over which includ cabbag kim chee bean sprout cucumb kim chee green onion salad fish cake tini fish raw garlic slice jalapeno pickl daikon a bean dip past and my favorit  sesam oil with korean salt  he onli brought over one dish of each so we were soon request refil on just about everything

th raw food were soon to arriv and the waiter laid out the beef and pork onto the hot woklik grill in the center  he also ad some bean sprout and cabbag to the middl  as we wait for our meat to cook we dove into the banchan  we also ask about the rice which he then brought over five bowl of steam white rice 2each

a we devour our meat and our grill becam empti we sat around wonder about our octopus  it was sit in a bowl on the next tabl but we werent sure what to do next sinc they had shut our fire off  when we final got their attent they ask if we want our bill  we ask about the octopus and onli then did he realiz that it was still sit raw on the next tabl  so he turn on the grill and cook the octopus  the bf ask about the soup and onli then did the waiter ask if we want our fri rice  uhyeah  we were quit bother by this sinc they were alreadi ask us if we want to pay and we hadnt receiv half of our meal still  the fri rice was also ad to the grill and we got two bowl of the soup to share amongst us

w realli enjoy the food  it was tasti great flavor and just a good meal overal  4 star for food

th servic on the other hand is what make me frustrat  we were forgotten about and im not sure if it becaus we were in the corner or what  we alway had to ask about get our tea refil and when we ask if we could just have the pitcher they said no they onli had one pitcher  i ask for more napkin which never arriv until i ask again  the differ waiter would come by and shut the heat off befor our food was cook and it was just so hard to get their attent  one waiter final mention that they were understaf with onli three waiter that night  they just look unorgan  we final said we were readi for the check which also took forev to come  did they want us to pay or not  2 star for the service

im use to get shikhy at the end of the meal but they didnt have it here either  argh

i definit want to go back but i can onli hope the servic will be a lot better the next time  and im sure were go to bring a larger parti the next time we come too

sidenot they offer a 20 from 10 pm to 8 am  are they open 24 hour then  im not sure 

you can find pic of our dinner in the busi profil090710

came here on a cowork suggest  he made sure i understood him when he said it was a dive  yes bill i get it  onc that was out of the way he then said that this is where his famili went for good noodl at least three time a month  hes right sb doesnt have much of an atmospher and it soon becam clear that the major of their busi was in takeout sale mani were colleg student or middleag male  so busi in fact that my simpl order of crab puff and combo beef and pork noodl took longer than id expect 2025 minut  

the crab puff were actual decent i wouldv prefer a toastier look  howev they were nice crisp and not too greasi  that is after id toss them over a few hundr paper towel  the noodl were tasti and i prefer the saltier pork over the sweet beef  if onli the noodl dish i order at china magic the next day was as tasti as this one was  be sure to have someon with you to share bec this entre wont tast as good the next day the noodl dri up overnight in the fridgessenc of thai is pretti decent thai food despit the fact that they have crap rangoon with imit crap list as an appetizer

i brought a cowork here while we were in las vega on a busi trip  he had never had thai food and his first experi he open the menu and spot the crap rangoon straightaway

that made for some bare control guffaw  nice  so this is the food you want to introduc me to

mov on we share some chicken satay  it was veri good with a mild bite and great yellow curri flavor  i order the panang curri and my cowork order a beef stir fri sort of thing  he report it was good with no sign of crap

th panang curri was nice  i order it 5 out of 10 on the spici scale sinc i had never eaten here befor  i would go more like 7 or 8 if you like it hot  the dish was veri good  the shrimp were tender and juici not sproingi and overdon as sometim happens

i also had a thai ice tea which was yummi although not as strong flavor as most thai restaur version

overal i would dine at essenc of thai again  skip the crap thoughfriend servic veri attent slow to bring bill

food was averag a bit on the extrem salti side

pric were a bit high but they offer even dinner special for 699

server talk us into order the wonton souplarg was 795 with skimpi portion a few wonton slice chicken tough beef 23 shrimp half cup of cabbag and lot of bland broth not worth the price

restroom clean but no soap in women restroom

decor was veri nice

park is veri convenient

next door to a barber shopdefinit better than buffet asia  this might be chines food heaven for someon that live in the booni but it was just alright for me  they definit offer a lot for the price and i happili stuf myself with as mani green veggiesmeat combo as possibl  

all the server were realli friend and were prompt to refil beverag and take away plate  

33389821 starthis was our first visit and it is about time as my curios for the last few year has been go wild everi time we pass by and see a pack lot

i use to live just a block from here approxim four year ago when they were build krazi buffet i had move just prior to their open and wonder what affect it would have on one of my favorit chines restaur just down the street bobo china 

i was in the mood for chines and we were veri hungri want to resolv our lunch and dinner all in one shot

th place is clean has comfi cushi booth lot of varieti of food to select from and great staff clear tabl and bring drink refills

th food was good not bad and not great the sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usual horrid i enjoy the stuf mussel orang chicken fri rice fri shrimp coconut shrimp sushi meatbal skewer pot sticker cherri banana and coconut macaroon for dessert

mmmmm those pork meatbal skewer were pack full of flavor with a drizzl of bbq sauc on them yummi i could sit and just eat a plate of those ball and be satisfi 

they have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the top and dress you could want

mi hubbi realli enjoy the super big juici chicken wing fri to perfect in a delici light batter

thi visit did the trick we came we ate and we conquered

their build was built new and look nice on the outsid howev the insid of the restaur was dumpi look with old boothhidden in a random strip mall there a good chanc plenti of peopl pass duke without realiz that they are miss out now this is a dive bar so like all other dive bar you have to take it for what it is the floor could be shinier the bathroom could be cleaner but then it wouldnt be an authent dive bar would it

duk is a solid choic when look for a place to play some bar game watch sport and enjoy some drink it spacious and great for larg group you name the game theyv got it sever pool tabl dart shuffl board foosbal etc tvs line the wall with your favorit sport team play with the reason price drink this is a good place to pregam befor a sport event or set up shop and watch it on tv 

ive host a parti at duke and it a perfect locat becaus of the size tvs game and most import becaus they dont charg to rent out the parti room so you can have up to 100 peopl in a parti room without ani fee and for a girl on a budget tri to throw a low key parti this was a perfect choic 

so i suggest duke if you are look for a dive bar night on the town and you dont want to just sit around when you get therewas get my car wash next door and want to grab a bite to eat  sinc i love bbq this was an easi decis for me to give this place a shot  after brows the menu i decid to try
4 oz bbq beef brisket sandwich 450
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosz8embhzi3mmspml7tj6tgselecterry3muhvfqdfzqpcjrhzw
2 oz hot link sandwich 3
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosz8embhzi3mmspml7tj6tgselectqxtdcqqimxhfcmow1iyj9g
i got them both dress which mean they give you onion  pickl on the side to put on the sandwich

next to the soda fountain there are vat of hot  mild bbq sauc for self servic  i of cours went for the hot bbq sauce

th food is deliv to your tabl when it readi  i went for the hot link sandwich first and didnt put ani hot bbq sauc on it so that i could tast the natur spici of the hot linkwel i was disappoint it not veri hot at all  damn the search for real bbq hot link sandwich continues

next i went for the bbq beef brisket sammiei pour some hot bbq sauc and ad the onion  pickl to it  it not a bad sandwichpretti good  i thought the bread was a bit blahlik groceri store breada nice italian or french roll would have been better with it  the beef was tender and juici and had a slight smoki flavor to it  i prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it but like how they serv you the sandwich dri and allow you to put your own bbq sauc on it

th hot bbq sauc was pretti spicyr enjoy that a lot

overal it was a pretti good experience

return factor  71this restaur has been open for about 7 month in my old hood in scottsdal in the sonora shop mall off the 101 and flw between the best buy and stapl the restuar has a sister locat in mesa
th owner are thai
 
the decor is clean neat almost quaint and without a lot of thai decor influenc they do play a sort of ttradion thai melodi meet new age relax type cd and it is relax 

i came for lunch they run 10 lunch special for 695 which includ a side salad of romain and carrot strip with a light soysesam dress to satisfi the most caucasian scottsdal neighborhood the choic are part chines orang chicken kung pao japanes chicken teriyaki and thai pad thai panang

i had panang chicken curri which came with your choic of fri or steam rice steam jasmin the curri come in your prefer spice level from 1 to 5 pick 3 which is about right for most the curri had a nice flavor with nice small piec of chicken with julien red bell pepper i ad a thai ice tea to drink for 2 

they have the usual color of curri all about 10 soup like tom yum koong salad like yum woon sen larb and papaya and noodl like pad thai pad se ew and rad nar 

a bit american but tasti and veri reason there are few choic for thai in scottsdal so if you have crave tri this oneasian food is one of my veri favorit cuisin and for that reason i find myself at this store mani time look for that asian ingredi that one can not find at your usual supermarket 99 ranch market is locat in chinatown so it goe without say that drive and park here may be an adventur on itself where rear view mirror are onli use to hang cute ornament for good luck
 onc you make it to the store your on your own chanc are better to find waldo shop here than an employe will to help you this time i was look for kaffir lime leav that a thai recip requir i ask a ladi work the produc where i could find it and she simpli said no i thought she didnt understand what i was ask for so i tri to show her a pictur of it from my phone and without look at it she said no i continu look for the rest of the item i need and when i ask her again for anoth item she said no it was then that i realiz that i might have been get a record answer or that it was the onli word she knew so i went in search of the rest of the ingredi on my own
y there a bad smell toward the back but you have to keep in mind that although the employe are not veri live they do keep live seafood and they kill clean and fri it for you on the spot
hav found onli one of the ingredi i need i gave up on my tom yum i paid for my fri tilapia a bottl of soy sauc and drove home with some of the smell with me
fam chines proverb not use at 99 ranch market a smile will gain you ten more year of life or nahabsolut great place for everyth other than fish

im realli favor about this place for their dog ear mushroom duck ox tail enoki and rabbit heck you can get both duck and rabbit for less than the cost that most place charg for chicken and i havent gotten here often enough to do more than perus the can good and spice and dem aisl is load with stuff can eel anyone

but i must say i was repuls by the fish tank not onli were the fish stack and drown  yes fish can drown  but they were smell unpleas foul i person wouldnt know eat ani of their seafood though the choic is quit vari so caveat emptor on the ocean go food 

on weekend it doe get a bit crowd and someon who accompani me swore it use to be a bigger store mayb space becam a premium or they use more space for storag and wareh two cart cannot negoti an aisl side by side well at all

th last thing i can say is that bewar the asian driver in the park lot ive work profession in a field that qualifi me to say there is a reason there are no profession asian formula 1 driver and the older the driver is the more exponenti wors the drive skill rememb drift is almost a control wipeout so i end with caveat drivorthis pf chang locat is conveni locat for the peopl that live in north phoenix metro  im not a big fan of pf chang for i think the drown their food in way too much sauc and i dont care for their rice becaus it almost alway too dri and clumpi  

i do think pf chang is aok onli becaus they offer a good varieti of gluten free option great tast app and my famili like come here  we are also somewhat limit with a few good place to eat in the far north metro area 

food  my last visit i had the hot  sour soup  it was ok but would be better with some chicken or beef  app were fri calamari  veri good with a littl extra saltpepp and a squeez of lemon  main dish was kung pao chicken  again way too much sauc chicken was veri good but the veggi were not cut even as a result some were over cook and some under cook  i was go to say someth to our server but with all that sauc it all tast the same  i ask for a substitut of noodl in place of my rice but that was an upcharg 

we want our littl desert shooter to go which they dont make it to go  our server brought us a contain to scrape our desert into  reali it a shooter desert and they give you this tini spoon to use  

go for the app have a cocktail and call it a night at pf changthe food is way too spici and the number system for spici level is definit off we order a 4 and a 5 spici level the differ between the two were more like a 7 and a 10 even for a spice love indian this indian food place was way off  

the naan is superb dont bother order the tandoori roti quit a disappoint also the shrimp were spectaculartoo spici but still veri good 

keep in mind that you might need reserv if you go on weekend or holiday just call ahead the ambianc insid is quit nice and a job well donestop in here for lunch with mike c today  we split a larg bull durham pizza which had salami pepperoni ham sausag beef  linquica  there a clean simpl decor it a littl expens   the pizza is veri good

lg bull durham pizza 14 pile up good with everyth abov 2069  a 12 medium at 1709 would have been sufficiafter a strenuous day tri to turn nickel into million at my favorit monopoli slot machin and play all the hard way we end up at blt burger at the mirag where we were stay awhil back

their signatur blt burger was pretti good a gf and i share the salmon burger and some salad i guess i was tri to be healthier but unfortun also it didnt hit the spot actual the cobb salad was decent but the salmon burger was dri noth wors than a dri fish patti luckili the bf was kind enough to give me some of his burger to wash down the salmon fri were pretti good but comment on food in a casino can be tricki cuz usual your either drunk your tastebud are kill from all the smoke inhal or
your brain is half zap from get zero sleep

but it all made the stop at studio b buffet on the way home all the much betterdinner while surround by tabl of rodeo fan with countri music in the air bull ride championship and footbal air on tv and a beefi burger in hand  i have to say  i couldnt help feel a littl manlier after eat at blt burger

similar to holstein in the cosmopolitan blt burger serv up a varieti of specialti burger and alcoholinfus shake in a casual yet trendi atmospher  the menu also includ altern like salad and a varieti of startersappet and dessert but let be honest  the burger and drink are all you realli need

although the menu offer more uniqu varieti like the lamb tandoori burger  i kept it simpl with the blt burger doubl smoke bacon lettuc tomato and blt burger sauce13 and ad monterey jack chees 100 and a fri egg 150  howev look back on it now i suspect my order was flip with my friend sinc i dont rememb get ani lettuc or tomato in mine  in ani case whatev burger i had was still pretti good httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbltburgerlasvegasselectvz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2toba15vvfhsg8yps4b9ouo17dg  it was cook exact as order had a decent char and it was still fair moist though not quit juici  the patti could have use a littl more season but it was fine given the egg chees and bacon httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbltburgerlasvegasselectvz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2tobabhfvbjeqjszwbjzed4zqa  i wasnt a big fan of the bun though

sinc the burger dont includ fri our tabl decid to share order of the onion ring and the sweet potato fri  on both count they were fine but not must tri item either  the onion ring were wrap with a thick crunchi batter httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbltburgerlasvegasselectvz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2tobaldhqumhwzfwsqrlfxtwbiq while the sweet potato fri were nice thin and crispi httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbltburgerlasvegasselectvz1vhnldqzavwhnhd2tobagc1m4oxomtixeksirbika

whil i certain wouldnt have a problem come back to blt burger i round down my three and a half star if onli becaus im not sure the valu is there  it realli not that expens overal especi for the strip but id rather go back to holstein sinc the fri are alreadi includ and their menu offer are a bit more appealmy fianc request my presenc at voce last tuesday night for a late dinner and entertain from the bad sneaker band

id never heard of it befor nor had i ever been in the shop center that it locat in  not the case for mani regular there  it was pack when we arriv  

fyi  they charg a 10 per person cover for their live music so be prepar for that and you may also want to go earli if your plan a night at voce to get a decent seat  

it was a fair larg menu  we had a tough time decid what to order  at our waitresss suggest we went with an order of the rigatoni with sausag and pea and a pizza la rustica  pasta was was great pizza just decent  add wine and your meal can get pricey 

65  tip for our date night

check it out for their live music and intim dine experi  it not go to be a regular stop in the rotat but id for sure return  especi for bad sneaker on a given tuesday nightit a buffet so honest i dont think i could ever give it 5 star   they had a veri good varieti about 68 entre about 4 side a small salad bar and a small desert bar 

the flavor were pretti solid the biggest problem was that most of the entre item had dri out and it was onli 12 noon   if they had plastic cover or cover the meat item with sauc it would have been much much better

th starter item of plantain were good but a littl sweet for me  i didnt finish them

not bad and i might go back but if im go to a buffet id rather stick to my indian buffetit taken me a while to get back around to this one becaus there are so mani excel place to eat here in downtown phoenix  so today arlin b join me to stop into rightw world here for lunch  your proprietor nicol is cook up freedom toast freedom fri  so on  youll recogn her by the semiautomat pistol hang off her side

ok so you order  i went with a pastrami hero  just told her to make it good  with lot of mustard choic of yellow or spici  everyth els except mayonnais and extracost cheese

soon my sandwich was up  it was fair big built on a soft roll cover with sesam seed  delici  

pastrami hero 775 plus 50¢ for a cup of water  but no extra charg for new york attitud     o

whatev  ill probabl be back     noth here actual wowd me
noth i ate realli made me think i have to have this again

thi was like eat in a librari everyon was quit theyw were afraid to talk becaus it was so pretenti the classic music featur such hit as httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvwodmudlnpafeaturerelated
listen to this song and you can imagin the set 
i was seat on a purpl velvet couch with pillow after fidget with the pillow to prop myself up right at the tabl well i notic a foot stool odd for such a fanci place i thought but i had walk quit a way in 4 inch heel so i use it  i later found out this appar is for you purs awkward

first of all the waiter seem to hang on your everi word which was annoy if i want to talk to my date well i dont need anyon chime in i ask my date what do you think this mean refer to someth on the menu out of no where pop a waiter who answer just as he is about to answer that what i mean the whole meal we had to whisper we final start text each other that pretti bad

if i smile the head waiter would come over and ask if i need someth i would say no im fine pretti soon i just kept smile to drive him crazi it work he kept stop at everi pass he probabl now think i had the hot for him

quick tip for those of you too embarrass to ask if you see a menu item that say supp 40 after it that mean on top of the menu price they add 40 dollar to it for whatev reason like the truffl chees souffl they said it was becaus of the amount and price of truffl use the lamb well i guess it was a babi lamb fed gold flake and the milk of the god 

anyway on to the food 
the amus bouch aka gift from the chef was a tin on a plaqu it look like a tin of caviar but it had someth creami under it it was interest i ate it to be polit but it was noth special in fact it was rather flavorless and the textur was off put it look pretty

everyth was plate beautifully
th crab salad was my favorit menu item and my second cours it was excel and almost too pretti too eat the flavor and textur combin were amazing

mi date chees souffl was too rich for me the date ate it and was not impress  the expens truffl realli did not seem to add anyth to the dish other than a present factor

th main cours i pick was lobster it was beauti but a littl tough i expect it to melt like butter in my mouth it didnt in fact it was hard to cut the flavor was ok noth special

i tri my date lamb it was veri good it tast like ani other lamb i have had at a restaur which made me wonder again whi the upgrad in cost

th best part about the meal to me was the bread cart oh my god it was pure heaven they realli need to open up a bakeri for these cloud from heaven they had the flakiest butteriest most flavor wonder assort of goodi well i almost fill up on bread 

you can have as mani cart item from ani cart as your heart desir dont be afraid to say one of everyth when a cart come stroll by after 2 trip of the cart i pretti much did there was garlic rosemari twist brioch chees bread croissant crostini baguett almost everi type of bread imagin and the absolut best

th 20 martini or specialti drink were delici worth 20 a pop not realli i did not tast or feel ani alcohol i think we should have gone for a nice bottl of wine

our actual dessert that came with the menu they were odd a strang menageri of ingredi that i still am not sure if they went togeth well i did not finish mine

th dessert cart was pretti none of the candiestreat were anyth special coffe and water are extra

aft the meal here  680 for 2 i wonder if rich peopl eat like this all the time and if so well i am glad i am not that rich or stuffi i am howev a food connoisseur someon who has alway dream of eat at a 3 michelin star rate restaur someon who would realli appreci the whole experi i was somewhat disappoint but i was truli happi for the experience

not i talk about price a lot but in actual  is no object for me so it is more fyi for middl incom averag diner visit for special occasi have mix feel about joël robuchon and im perfect will to admit that it becaus this joint is way out of my leagu financi  we read mani review about this place and found them to be accur particular when they address the qualiti of the food  no question this was the best food we have had in vega and perhap ever everyth and i mean everyth was just knock your sock off delici complex interest and indulg  the servic was beyond impress too  everyon knew what everyth was the wait staff was choreograph to negoti huge tray with or without food on them in a way that made the whole oper look like a balanchin ballet  so you can imagin how hard it is to find anyth to complain about  the culinari experi was nearflawless

wait a darn minut what do mean near  well two thing a the portion size and b the price

i still stand by my statement about the qualiti  i had a lobster cook with uni sea urchin roe on a bed of truffl risotto that was to die for  the problem is that the portion fit on what was basic an oddlyshap ramekins soup bowl  and so it was with the other portion bare enough to teas your palat have you hum in delight and it gone who know the portion were so small that i suspect evapor might even be a factor

then came the bill  good grief  let me digress at seat one of the waiter ask if we want to start the even with some champagn we said sure to which he repli white or pink  what the heck one of each  that statement as it turn out ad 70 to the bill

im not go to divulg how much the meal set us back but ill give you enough for an educ guess  not be abl to even think about the 16cours 495 chef cours we opt for the 165 prix fix which had four cours amus bouch appet entré and a thin plate of chocol for dessert the bread cart came by befor the appet too  a bottl of riesl clear the centuri mark you know how much the champagn was one of the appet came with a surcharg i think it was becaus it had extra truffl or someth and we did have some hungarian tokaj to sip with the chocol  the term sticker shock doesnt quit cover it

il end this my first yelp review by emphas that if i were a person of more affluenc in this case much more i would most like not care about the bill becaus the food was so good it would eclips the expens  we came we ate we enjoy we marvel we learn and well most like never be backwent here on christma eve for a special celebr like most i was excit to go to first 3 michelin star restaur was expect to be blown away by food and servic and ambienc so not the case

food

everyth was good but not great mani of the delici were monotextur soft soft and more soft no crunch no textur perhap i order the wrong dish but how mani type of gele and you put in your dish

food temperatur was good but not great 

famous robuchon potato are delici perfect smooth and creami i think it should be call robuchon butter serv with a hint of potato

bread and desert cart were awesom what doe that tell you when i rememb the bread cart more than the meal i could probabl just eat the bread cart all night you pick and choos your bread and then it is return perfect warm to mealt the smooth butter but when you ask for second it come back cold ok whi heat the first batch and then just give me the second batch right off the cart which lead me to the next category

service

michelin star rate is base on food and servic they go hand in hand right wrong we were seat i went to the restroom when i return the host had drop off the menu to the onli guest at the tabl and left no intro no explan no welcom nada

th tablecloth had a big stain yes a nasti chocol like dish had smear into the top fishnet pattern cloth so there was piec of a meal embed in the interstici wow someon wasnt pay attention

i should have ask for the special limo and come in via the mansion but were run late and had to get to a show 

tips

when the waiter ask you for water expect to pay 1020 a pop on the bill

dont bother ask for the a la cart menu unless you want to pay 200 for an entre dish 

you get a delici piec of dark chocol to go home with 

mi wife has gone to per se 3 michelin and i have been to coi 2 michelin and countless 1 michelin star restaur michael mina gari danko villag pub quinc and robuchon is at the bottom of the list in term of food servic and valu 

next stop the french laundrii cant bring myself to give this place more than 3 stars

th food was fantast  perfect cook well seasonedag and delicious

th servic was good but be train in front of the hous for high end restaur i cant help but take notic of some glare mistak  one that wouldnt bother me if we were have a 150 pp meal but at 400 pp i expect perfect  while train my professor said that the cours would ruin mani of my dine experi and well this is one of them 

exampl  i ask a serverback server for more bread  1 i should have been offer more bread i should not have had to ask  2 no problem  my train has taught me to hate that phrase when was it ever a problem 3 when we got our first order of bread they took it back into the kitchen to heat so we had warm tasti bread to enjoy upon our second and third order the bread was not heat and was cold  where is the consistency

next was the atmospher it was great modern french remind me of some of the wineri and french countri hous ive dine at in that part of the world but there were the tabl mat  the goddamn tabl mat while veri pretti were pain made of this hard plastic substanc they were pokey and went the length of the tabl had i been wear a sport coat i may not have notic but it vega summer begin and it 90 degre outsid and the restaur seem to have a casual dont dress like an asshol dress code so i was wear a short button up shirt  and the mat were relentless like wasp into my arms

wel that my rant

al in all i did realli enjoy our experi it would have been veri hard to complain about if i hadnt ruin futur dine experi by studi the subject  and i feel bad about rate onli 3 star but at the price point i feel like everyth should be perfective never expect great decor from vietnames eateri but a viet restaur insid in 50s style diner is someth ive never thought id see  it strang but understand after the econom crash and restaur close over night caus properti owner to rent out space quick and cheaply

lemongrass is the exact place where you shouldnt judg a book by it cover  it serv up some of the most authent everyday vietnames dish there are even a coupl of specialti ive never seen anywher els in vegas

ther are the standard pho noodl soup vermicelli noodl salad and banh mi sandwich which allow me to never have to drive to chinatown if i have a crave for the usual fare

but if your a nonvietnames and have never had someth besid the dish list abov let me draw your attent to a few viet offer that are lessknown but just as delicious

1 stuf calamari fresh squid stuf with minc glass noodl shrimp and ground pork and then deep fri  this dish is timeconsum to make and doesnt yield too much profit which explain whi ive main had it homemad but complet yummy

2  tuna in tomato sauc a peasant favorit that stand the test of time it bring me back to the day of when my grandma use to cook this for me  it sound simpl and it is tuna filet are fri and then top with crush tomato with garlic and basil  simplic in peasant food is usual what make it so emotional

3  lotus salad usual seen at parti a rare except we dont have too mani salad in vietnames cuisin that work  thin piec of lotus stem are mix with jicama pork shrimp and mint then top with roast peanut and serv with tamarind fish sauc  a healthi altern as an appet or main entrerandom that it is in an old diner  they have heu tieu on the menu  my favorit dish when i visit vietnam  not near as good here but the closest ive gotten to it here at home  the broth is a good flavor  thin clear noodl the seafood in it is not fresh so that is the main downfal  i still like it better than pho the pho tast good  the fresh spring roll were veri good and clean tast had an overal good experising it with meree robinyum 

oohhh my goodnessmi brain cant think becaus it is soo loud in here  now i rememb whi back in the day i would bring my babi here  becaus no matter how loud she scream no one notic lol  i think it so loud that you actual have to yell to communic with the person you are with so it all an ugli vicious cycl 

sunday afternoon we decid on a burgerlunch and thought it had been so long sinc we had been here  now we rememb whi hahah the wait area was full but must have been for a larg parti becaus our parti of 2 got seat right away  everi seat in this place was full  ton of larg parti full of famili and friend  mayb the afterchurch crowd as well  so much i forgot about this placenot a frequent favorit just for the fact there arent too mani healthi option here  if you can control yourself they do serv salad  im just not sure how healthi they are sinc im not the one who can order salad with a menu that has fantast pictur entic your blur and echo think  

we were liter seat for less than 5 minut when our waitress came to apolog for the wait  wait  what wait  veri nice girl but a littl ditsi  i dont general go for burger anywher  i usual opt for the grill chicken for a healthier choic  today i was go all out  here what we ordered

whiski bbq burger  slight greasi bun top with a juici on the insid burger with crispi onion string and a smoki bbq sauc  yes i didnt go for the lowest in caloriefat option  it was pretti great though  i had to cut it in fourth so i could actual eat it in a nice nonmessi way  my onc a year indulg didnt fail meeruntil just nowshow stopper  might i say how disgust i am now that i look at the nutrit valu of this burgeroh my freakin gawd1138 calori 70 gram of fat  holi shit  my hour workout that night didnt even put a dent in that  not even funni right now sniff snifftear

to continuebf order a regular chees burger with mustard and crispi onion string  he said it was the best hes had in a long time  he order a side of coleslaw and love it

and dont forget the bottomless steakfriesit what they advertis on tv  and i am not even look at the nutrit valu of these god help me here  i have to say that im not a huge fan of steak fri but i ate a few anyway  ive seen other review about the season on the tabl  noth at all special to me  the fri are dri anyway and the season doesnt even stick  so eh on the fri mayb i will substitut them next timefor salad disgust still  btw we didnt need bottomless as there were plenti that we didnt finishthank god

custom servic is outstand  the manag check on our tabl sever time  drink never ran low and our server was super attent in the midst of her mani other tabl  i am often amaz when someon can juggl all that and still be pleasant and attent  i know  yes agreedthat how it should be

overal the place is fun loud and perfect to bring your realli boister famili and friend to clog their arteri  enjoy that would ya  i realli like this place but they screw up some easi thing which i think is problemat 

when my cousin and i got there we were eventu greet by a server who was super casual dont get me wrong i dont need pomp and circumst but when the kid at in n out is more profession then houston we got a problem

second for some crazi reason the booth behind our had about 25 outdoor seat cushion stack up i know they are for outsid and need to go somewher but this is saturday night at 7 put them away they spent thousand of dollar on ambianc onli to ruin it with a stack of cushion weird

ok keg those are some issu that need work the food was good as usual but it not enough to carri a sketchi servic otherwis iron we chose keg over durant which in retrospect was a grave errorim not a big fan of the concept of the walmart neighborhood market  accord to walmart it suppos to woo shopper with easier park less crowd aisl and quicker checkout i can see how that would be appeal to someon who treat walmart supercent as the place to do their primari groceri shop in that case the individu would probabl welcom the opportun to skip out on the toy electron home good and massiv line that character your averag super walmart they would probabl be thrill with the fact that this version of walmart maintain the low price but downsiz the space and speed up checkout and for that matter has selfcheckout which larger walmart do not 

howev sinc i shop for groceri elsewher my love fresh and easi or frys onli get food at walmart if im also there shop for other thing and see walmart as a place to find home good paper product cat food towel at realli low price the neighborhood market doesnt realli serv my need when i went to this locat last night to check it out on the day of it grand open i discov that the select of nonfood home good is pretti small as an exampl they onli had 23 brand of cat food they also didnt have hard alcohol onli wine and beer and the deli select look pretti slim 

to sum it up if you frequent larger walmart for food limit hous good and the pharmaci you will appreci have a downsiz version of the store if you like go to walmart to find a realli larg select of everi kind of product you will probabl not find the neighborhood market too usewhen arrowhead grill came up as next on my list of place to review the first thought that cross my mind was i need to give this place anoth shot so here is my first impress of arrowhead grill great place if they step up the servic 

i visit ag with a friend dure restaur week the restaur had just open up and server were still set up here and there we were seat immedi and we wait to be greetedand wait final our waiter made his way over to our tabl here my thing when you open your door for busi you should be readi for busi readi for custom you could tell he was unprepar to help us out 

what about the food fantast i thought the food was great i start with hog island kumamoto oyster they were small fresh and sweet oyster no funki smell or tast total fresh and delight 
for my entre i had the 10 oz delmonico steak rare of cours what a great slab of beef i sent my compliment to the chef the steak was cook beauti and season perfect on the side i had the yukon gold mash potato which were delici 

i was full of meat and potato good but we had dessert come i chose the creme brule which was perfect consist and finish tabl side which was a nice touch so in between cours our waiter would vanish the restaur wasnt pack at allso i can onli guess he was still do set up work but that left my drink empti on too mani occas and me need a set of silverwar i was annoy unfortunately

i will certain give arrowhead grill anoth shot the food was veri good hope the qualiti of servic will match the food on my next visita girlfriend and i stop in for wine and appet on tuesday even  we sat at the bar and were there for about 2 12 hour  it not my first time at ag and ive alway enjoy the food and servic as be ok  this visit was no differ  the bartend was not attent whatsoev and actual seem distrac by a femal in workout attir sit at the other end of the bar mayb his girlfriend  he was somewhat pleasant but it was hard to get his attent and we had to ask for everyth  he never offer us food menus or inquir if we plan on eat  i realli like the fact that this is not a chain and the food is usual better than the chain too  but for the price here i think they could do better  im pretti certain my bill would have been bigger with more attent servic and i can guarante his tip would have beeni had want to tri the happi hour here but just miss it end at 6 and decid to stay and tri out dinner they have a nice big patio along a not too busi street this is a nice place to come on a date in this area 

i ask if they made ani of their pasta in hous and the onli one that i was told was made fresh was the fettuccin so i substitut it in the garganelli carbonara dish it was yummi a good balanc of pasta sauc chicken and spinach i usual never have enough chicken for the pasta but i actual had chicken and not pasta left my boyfriend had the lasagna i took one bite and thought it was realli good he said it had some hard chunk of tomato that he wasnt too fond of we ask for more bread which never came becaus it was frozen or someth we were told it was delay but it never came 

we had the vanilla bean creme brule and caramel creme brule it was serv in these small tea cup which were the perfect size for an after dinner treat the caramel was my favorit and they were onli 245 each 

i didnt tri the bruschetta but it look delici and i will definit come back to tri it 

pleas bring your patienc it took over an hour and a half to have dinner here and all we had were our pasta dish and dessert no appet or saladcame here for hh on friday and had a pretti good time no drink special for hh but they have a pretti decent appet menu with about 6 differ thing for 295 we order 3 appet a glass of wine and a beer and paid onli 20 befor the tip 

we had the spici shrimp and eggplant my favorit the slice steak bruschetta and the sausag pepperoni and ricotta flat bread minus the sausag the flat bread was realli thin more like a small thin crust pizza these three appet alon would have cost us 35 at dinner 

the servic this time was great we got our food in no time the bartend are super friend and were alway check up on us and joke around well definit be back for happi hourtotal east coast dive deli and there noth wrong with that ccc is a place that has what your look for when you need a quick lunchtim meal coffe fresh cooki daili soup special salad wrap hot wich it all there while the menu on the wall list about 20 item dont be afraid to make a custom sammi they have a decent select of bread meat chees and top for you to make a beauti lil hoagi for yourself while noth will blow you away here it nice to know that there still a sandwich shop in town with a friend owner run the place and some homemad food on the special boardi realli want to give this place anoth star but cant as of yet it is korean famili own they are in the process of get their liqour licens so their menus were a bit confus they didnt have the beer pictur on the menu and they were out of or did not have what we realli want to order from the menu no fatti tuna etc etc i suggest either not have those menus out or mark out what is not avail it was a bit confus 

we final start with the green mussel and crab angel they were ok imit crab eh the ikura was good see pic the kid love those damn thing the roll we order tast realli good but i cant rememb the name it had red snapper on top it came apart easili and their mayonnais sauc was a littl too orang look compar to what i have seen the meat eater seem to love the dolsot bibimpap with all the littl side the tuna titaki was differ hard sear at all 

i have been here befor it a cute littl place i love the staff they are super nice there was ton of peopl pick up food while we ate there were also sever other diner be serv the best thing about this place is the pictur of all the dish on the wall i think that is pure genius 

the new sign say jk sushi it was also known as the japanes bawl not bowl i agre with aletheia on this place though it truli is better than hana on 7th ave httpwwwyelpcombizjkbowlphoenix

i agre with what mani say that the place is overpr but we clear had a better lunch than mani  dont know if theyr inconsist or if we just order better  here what we had
shanghaines pork dumpl a pretti basic dish that is hard to do bad  the dumpl did take a while to come out we were told this in advanc suggest that they are fresh  they were fresh steam and pretti good
cantones roast duck this dish was small but veri tasti  the duck was nice cook and the skin was flavor and crispi  enjoy this
satay ox tail noodl soup our waitress was veri pleas that we both knew what ox tail was and that we like it  appar most of the whitey that go there dont  live in la we eat everyth  this was super interest  vietstyl  pho with thaistyl satay base with chinesestyl ox tail  it say it spici and im sure it is for some  i want it hotter so we doctor it with some of the sauc on the tabl  i enjoy this dish a lot  great mix of flavors

wildflow   then target  costco and the gas station but here is the deal  i never know what the food will be like big portion littl portion  strang tast  no tast  awesom tastei am tire of the drama pleas decid on a mode and stick with it i need to know what to expect from this relationship  pleas let me know  hug and kiss and see you next sundaytorn over my feel for chill out i have decid to debat with myself like i did in front of my child psychologist

 what i love about central phoenix is like no matter what im in the mood for there alway someth close by that can satiat my crave it a good thing i dont crave fri chicken and mongolian hot pot too often i guess 

 oh shut the fuck up you werent crave anyth until you heard someon at tammi coe say the word gelato it just happen to be there

 still you cant deni the awesom of a gelato place on the row 

 right becaus no neighborhood is complet without a generic altern to ice cream shop 

 it is not generic 

 let do a rundown shall we pain clich pun on someth coldrel namecheck tacki decorcheck same assort of predict flavorscheck

 okay you serious need to stfu this isnt baskin robbin you cant blame them for have a limit select it gelato a dessert that while delici is simpli not as popular or as easi to mass produc as ice cream you cant fault them for not splurg on crazi flavor and top you have to serv what you know will sell besid they had a coupl uniqu flavor like the banana foster you know the flavor i uh we had that day

 oh my god after the third spoon or so i thought there were cut on my tongu it was so sharp and tart it stung i couldnt even tast ani cinnamon or brown sugar 

 i detect just a hint of rum flavor

 your the last person id talk to about flavor you who swear up and down that the sweat behind your ear smell like pizza hut breadsticks

 okay now that was out of bound 

 and sorbet nice and all but would it kill anyon to have soy gelato on hand i know it exist ive seen it at whole food i mean im not bash chill out for not have soy i just you know im just tire of sorbet

 you have never eaten sorbet ever

 i could eat sorbet

 your negat bullshit asid i still think it was pretti good especi at that price i mean as long as your buy the gelato and not ani of the coke product ugh im so over drink in plastic bottl so not green

 and what would be better for the environ miss earth day

 just carri a reusabl bottl or thermo and have them fill that up for you well if they had a fountain and not a cabinet of overpr high fructos cornim start to sound like you arent i

 cthulu forbid

 i think in time if they tri to expand their menu it could be a real cold spot get it you know instead of a hot spot

 die in a fire you vapid twat 

 bite me lilith fairwhen i was young my parent use to tell me that we would all meet up again in heaven at the time it seem pleasant and reliev to think that i could just do my own thing now and catch up with everyon after we were all nuke to death in the zombi apocalypse

and then it dawn on me that heaven might not be my scene i imagin an afterlif where i was forc to spend all of etern with all the guntot bibleb homoxenophob i spent my whole life antagon them look all fuck smug and happi peach christ it make me want to throw a shark at a mailman

so i have sinc decid that i will do whatev it take to get into hell with all the drink and sex and you know chang my gender and all im sure eventu ill check off enough box to get me a backstag pass to damnat 

i occasion burn down a villag and smash a goblin head in with a rock just in case i can get into valhalla

it sound like heaven a pizza buffet under 7 dollar as much pizza soup salad and dessert you could ever gorg yourself on everi varieti of pizza you could imagin fettuccin and spinach pizza taco pizza hawaiian pizza macaroni and chees pizza bbq chicken pizza 

and like the meal dispens machin from red dwarf the kitchen is infinit flexibl want a flavor of pizza not current avail on the buffet line theyll special make it just for you theyll even send out one of their underpaid lackey to bring it out to you on a tray like a secret waiter without digniti who wont expect a tip

ahh yes it a vener heaven for a pizza lover

until you realiz it everybodi els heaven everybodi els you hate

par who bring their five kid becaus littl timmi hasnt develop tabl manner yet and would just embarrass them at a real restaur 

the unreason picki eater who keep take one slice of each pizza on the line take the smallest of bite and decid it too salti too cheesi too sauci for his tast and throw it away forc you and the staff to watch at least three whole pizza thrown away befor he find a flavor he likes

th famili that wise figur that sinc grandma has a hard enough time walk to red lobster they might as well bring her somewher shell have to give her leg some exercis just to get some salad

al the underpaid bitter and apathet high schooler who all lost their job at harkin when they show up for work with their name tag missingth third time this month

it a shame ci cis has such a suck infest becaus theyll probabl be shut down by the health inspector befor anyon realiz that they arent just pizza maker theyr wizard no alchemists

on an alchemist school by the beast himself would be abl to take a lump of dough and make it into breadstick pizza chees bread cinnamon roll and appl pie

the first time i went they alreadi had 4 thing 86d off the menu at 7pm and sinc they had a slimmer summer menu in place it made it even narrow of a select 
i did have fresh softshel crab for app that go around with scallop for entre the scallop were over cook and the accompani risotto was under cook 
the most recent dine experi there i had pork belli as app and lamb loin for entre the pork was delici and the lamb was good but the spinach and babi carrot coin that came with were oversalt 

dessert were pretti good both time i went of cours everyon marvel at the cotton candi as well as the takehom cooki 

all and all if this place didnt price goug the shit out of you id might come back but after spend 200 on a mediocr dinner i am not like to return on my own accord072511

i have a new crush and it christoph restaur pizza  

ive been hold onto a restaurantcom gift certif id purchas to use at crush loung for a long time now and decid it was time to use it  i arriv w high expect of both the ambienc and the food and i wasnt disappoint much  the servic was a bit spotti at time we were immedi greet when we enter and were seat quick but the wait that came after water deliveri was a bit long at a time when there were no other guest seat around us  perhap there were other guest seat elsewher but they werent seat at the loung at the food bar nor outsid inde it seem like were were the onli one in the room besid the cook at the open kitchen area the server and the bartend  bread was deliv but we were each given onli one oneinch slice of a baguett  how strang especi when the butter cup held enough butter to spread over a whole loaf  whatev  two of the three dinner special were relay to us w the promis of come back to tell me about the scallop dish but when our server final came back ten or so minut later he ask if we were readi to order so i had to remind him about the scallop entre what was in it and how was it prepar and how much  hmmm mayb he was readi to go home

cam in w mom so we had to tri the calamari  i also chose the duck confit goat chees and fig pizza  for dessert we had the profiterol  i realli like the calamari coat light batter and fri goldenbrown  my fave piec of the squid are also my mom fave the tentacl so these were soon finish  at least half of the remain piec the slice bodi were undercook poor valu for the 12 menu price tag and i was charg 13 on the ticket  the pizza was terrif  love the semolina thin crust and the duck confit gave the entre a great smoki flavor i thought perhap there were lardon includ in this dish too but all the smoki came from the duck  mmmm the goat chees was veri creami and there were love chop fig all over the place id order this pizza again in a heartbeat  the profiterol were fantast as well  three slice choux pastri round fill w dark chocol sorbet vanilla and chocol ice cream sat on a pretti display made of chocol ganach and creme anglais whole blackberri and blueberri and a slice strawberri  more ganach was pour over the top of one profiterol upon present  i ask if i could have more ganach and our server quick oblig thank you  we love the crisp flaki of the pastri so perfect and out of the three flavor we like the fudgi dark chocol sorbet the most  i tell you if i couldv lick the plate clean i would have    excel dessert i total recommend

pizza reheat well  still love in flavor and just as crispi as it was when it was first deliv  cant wait to go back and tri the other varieti  happi hour uye anyoni couldnt hold out ani longer and final came out to a nightclub for the 1st time sinc be a new las vega resid i had heard about lavo befor i alway thought it was a pool kinda like wet republ but never went also the thing about vega is if your a dude and you wanna go out to these popular nightspot with your boy and plan to get in in a decent amount of time you either gotta 1 spend  like there no tommorro 2 get lucki walk in with some girl you just met come up with some bs stori about how you know someon there etc 3 come in late past 130 or so 4 or have a hookup fortun we had a hookup so off we went

th downstair restaur part of lavo is nice they were give us appet and drink on the hous all night so no complaint there a sizeabl group of saint fan congratul were at the bar parti up at about 1130 we walk out and walk right past the line to the club that were the hookup come in handi lavo remind me alot of the bank nightclub at the venetian small we had bottl servic but there was no rope to keep away the stragler so everyon was just mix in just like at the bank nightclub i thought the whole point of bottl servic was to have your own space the dj was beyond terribl i kid you not he did not play one song that was made after 2004 until right befor i left just all lil jon song im not a dj never have been and probabl never will be but i could have came up with a better list the chick who won the first season of for the love of ray j i think her name was cocktail is a gogo dancer there i mean i had fun i guess but there are definit better placebeauti italian restaur insid the palazzo with an outsid terrac which is where we dine we took my sister and husband to celebr their anniversari the insid is trendi soft light romant and veri comfi when we were taken to our tabl it took a bit long for our waitress to final come greet us throughout our meal she was just ok she seem to be in a rush everi time she came to our tabl not sure if she was swamp but when you are pay good money i do expect better servic 

we order a few cocktail and a bottl of wine i chose a super tuscan at a reason price when the bus boy brought over these aw littl by the glass thick short stemwar um yeah if i order a b bottl of wine pleas give me decent stem after i polit ask him for nicer glass he did bring over much nicer stem of cours my sister and brother in law thought i was be a wine snob it all good they have no clue ha ha

door open at 1030 pm 
friday and saturday and 11 pm sunday tuesday wednesday and thursday 

cover is 20 and local are admit free tuesday wednesday and thursdayok i hate do this but i wasnt wow at all 

i had never had rice pud in my life so i didnt have ani idea of what it should tast like 

the rice pud was veri bland i would actual never eat it again 
the dude in that day was veri veri nice and help i give the servic 5 star but the food 2 star 

an exampl is i hate cupcak but ate one at this place becaus i was starv and i fell in love 

this place made me realiz rice pud is bland and not someth i want to eat again

it wasnt vomit enduc so that good but all in all not worth a trip 

i was hope for a new treat discoveri 

someth els that was a turn off was the unsanitari look plastic contain that look like tupperwar they keep the pud in 

if i could chang one thing it would be that i almost didnt eat there becaus it look kinda gross 

but they get a 3 becaus i didnt want to puke and the servic was good 

mi girlfriend who love rice pud said it was bland and didnt eat half of the kid size she said it was veri averag 

i hope they make some chang and kick up the rice pud like tri it colder or more flavor  

sorri but i wont be backthe origin plan was to go to the bellagio buffet becaus one of our friend had never been to vega befor so we want to take her to a buffet experi and bellagio imho has the best

of cours it was a late start and when we got there the line was so long and no one want to wait so what could we do we were starv and walk around  this was the first place we saw  so we went in to grab a bite

it one of those cafe where you order and they give you your food and you find your own place to sit

w order the chorizo quich veget quich  both were okay although the chorizo one tast much better textur both were the same

th antipasto platter was nice with 3 type of meat chees oliv grill zucchini and mozzarella ball 

salmon platter was also decent with salmon laid onto flatbread and sprinkl with all the condiment you would find at a salmon spread

chef salad was nice too i order it becaus i felt we should eat someth healthy

our entir bill came to approxim 62 which is pricey for a nonservic cafe but this is the bellagio and it tast fine so that all i care about it was conveni and there wasnt a hoard of peopl in therelook for some huge croissant  this place has it  big dessert and coffe with an even bigger price tag at this joint  but hey were at the bellagio where price are expect to be high  palio is locat across from the galleri of fine art  insid youll find a well decor spacious and even a semiquiet cafe  palio has your coffe latt ice coffe dessert bagel muffin cooki sandwich croissant and even some premad sushi  all are price to profit and peopl buy it 

i admit i am not the biggest fan of palio with the main reason be price  the cheapest item on their menu is their basic americano for 450  think about it  starbuck carri this for 2 and we all know they are price high too  but when you have that 230 feel you do what you got to do  

servic is just okay and if they were abov and beyond id probabl up the star to 4  as of now just 3 star mean palio is just okayive been to season sever time and it ok  they general have someth that grab my attent and there someth that want me to take away a star  when we ate here sunday that stay as usual  

the grill veget were veri good  i alway like their roast garlic piec but this night the roast beef was cook until the cow could walk no more  it was deep deep brown  overcook completely

th spici tofu in the asian section was veri good and the desert round out the even on the plus side  i had some peach ice cream and a piec of carrot cake  a nice way to end a meal

th servic was veri good  there werent veri mani peopl in the restaur sunday night so the server were stretch to the limit  ill come back here and ill find someth quit good again and someth that i avoid or isnt quit as good  the place has lost some of the luster it had when it first openso let me start off with a basic fact about mei am not a buffet person  i will never ever  suggest we go to a buffet  i onli go when i am outnumb or when famili is visit so take this review as you may  

i went here for the first time this week sinc i had famili stay at the silverton  i have eaten at mani of the restaur there and have alway been happi so i was awar of the food qualiti level and just went with it  

it start off with us in a short line to pay and be seat  even though it was a realli short line it took over 25 minut to get a tabl  im not sure whi becaus there were a lot of open tabl that i could see and they seem to be adequ staf so i am not sure where the disconnect was  so that just put me in a bad mood becaus i was pretti hungri  just a warn for yall when i get hungri throw a cracker or someth at me becaus i turn into that girl from the exorcist when i am starv  you have been warned

next up the food  i was actual surpris how mani section they had avail  there was a soup and salad bar pasta bar pizza american comfort food chines mexican roastedgril meat and a dessert bar that includ fresh made ice cream  it wasnt a huge buffet but i found plenti of item that look and tast pretti good  no it wasnt as big as the world buffet at the rio or fanci like the wynn but it was ok for what it was  so yay for that surprise

th servic across the board was hit or miss  our tabl server was veri nice and on her game  she did great  the hostess were all a bit grumpi  some of the chef behind the food counter were not happi to be there but the chef at the meat crave station was just ador  the chef in the dessert section was happi  so it was a littl all over the place

so season is an averag buffet for vega qualiti  if you are a buffet person and in the area it is an ok placeit not taqueria guadalajara ill tell ya that much 
but it better than a dorito loco at 2am and that say a lot come from a guy whos a 2am dorito loco connosuimy first impress was cute cafe like italian restaur subt insert in a wall of the venetian

you might just walk by this littl restaur if you dont pay attent among the mani shop and littl store within the venetian trattoria reggiano may onli catch a glimps of your attent becaus of their outdoor patio it more just some tabl set up nice outsid not bad but i think they do that just to seat more peopl insid the restaur seat just a few parti becaus there are about 10 small booth more or less their kitchen is tini their ambianc definit catch the intend theme of an italian street side cafe

it a cute littl place if your crave some italian food great garlic roll almost drench in the oil and season some might complain but i person realli like it we order the margarita pizza and a pasta dish that i cannot recal the name of but neither of the dish were memor and i realli cant see myself order anyth other than the basic spaghetti or alfredo the next time i go there main id be back for their garlic roll the food was okay the servic was okay slight rude the ambianc quaint

th last impress ill be back for some good ol spaghetti and garlic roll but that about itfelt like carb up after a funfil memori day weekend

thi littl restaur was tuck in behind the lobster me stand there were about 68 small tabl outsid and 23 booth insid the ambianc was interest it was somewhat an authent italian feel but was off put by the venetian traffic walk by the staff was attent but seem hasten nevertheless they were veri sweet 

our noms

complimentari bread garlic knot  should have been a bit warmer im a season nazi and i think if they ad more season to the dough and ad lot of garlic it would be delici outsid was veri butteri i took these guy home and bake them and ad some garlic season which made them bomb

start fri calamari appet  larg portion light bread and fresh tast not bad but not the best ive tri either marinara that came with it was warm but strang i had to add some more s  p  crush red im start to think i just have a salti tongu 

entre i cant help but get pasta at everi italian restaur i come across the man got the spaghetti  filet mignon meatbal he thought it was ok but then again we are spoil by enoteca adriano in san diego spaghetti and meatbal best ive ever had for filet mignon meatbal i thought they would be moist and tender they came out a bit dri spaghetti was noth special 

mi entre linguini w shrimp in white sauc this usual come with clam but i had a bad experi with eat clam far from a coast i looov this it was light and refresh linguini was perfect al dent i finish the entir thing and even mop up the sauc with some garlic knot a squeez of lemon and fresh parmesan made it even better refer to pictur post 

all in all i would come back for the linguini 35 ohh the struggl of round up or down for a 35 star place im gonna have to round down becaus of the boyf lacklust spaghetti and meatbal sorri guys

honor mention oliv oil  balsalm were absolut delici they were obvious import yum 
note pasta dish rang from 1828 18 be the most basic pasta so i would say it is almost toward 

happi eat xoit probabl been about a year or so sinc ive been here i order the 3 piec combo with a larg drink for 905 pretti pricey for 3 piec of chicken and two smallish side and a drink 

ill let you in on a secret i pull the fri stuff off of my chicken and underneath all that fri stuff are juici and tasti piec of chicken the cole slaw at all of the kfcs is the best nobodi beat the colonel on cole slaw the biscuit was good i usual throw it out 9 time out of ten becaus it usual hard and rank tast so the colonel has definit step it up a few notch in the biscuit depart more mash potato instead of all that gravi peopl i didnt come here just to eat gravy

th place is clean and the employe seem to do a good job whi onli 3 star that constant drive up bell drove me nut i was tri to get some read in and the bell keep ring nonstop it kinda remind me of the acdc tune hell bell in the begin of the song imagin this bell sound everi 15 second while your in the din room    httpwwwyoutubecomwatchv0g1rqpuvw8ia neighborhood joint that we pass by all the time  coupon for this place come all the time so we figur we may as well give it a go

th restaur is split up into two section  dine in establish on the left bar area o the right  

they start you off with tortilla chip salsa and a bean dip while they get your drink order in

th husband order the mexican pizza larg 1045  it your choic of protein with all the standard fix of mexican food pile onto a crispi tortilla  

i went for the combin plate 3 item for 995 and chose an 
enchilada tamal and soft taco  for the most part you can choos your own fill a few cost extra and sauc on them  with it you get rice and bean  

when the order came out we thought they were both pretti generous  unfortun for me the request lowfat green cilantro rice and lowfat boil pinto bean were not replac the red rice and refri bean i had ask for  the waiter immedi took it back and they fix the problem  not sure if it was the waiter fault or the kitchen fault but it was done quick without too much drama

mi enchilada and tamal were both tasti although the chicken soft taco was a bit dri  that was probabl my least favorit part of the dish  it made for good leftov the next day

they also have a lite menu special for those 60 year and older game promo and more

servic was fine it wasnt too busi on a weekday for lunch so no real problem there

overal it a decent place for lunch when you want some mexican food  it help when you find those bogo coupon that come along thoughbest sandwich ever it was 1050 or so for just the sandwich and a small ice tea though

okay i have to tell you i got the capres sandwich i have not tri the other item on the menu so i chang my star rate to 3 and after i have sampl a few more thing i will let you guy know 

dont want to be misleadhob nob coffe hous is in this quaint littl old hous on mcdowel not far from the downtown area  upon enter i wasnt clear as to if i was in a coffe hous or a trendi gift shop with art for sale everywher you look  i also did not experi the aroma of fresh brew coffe as i walk in but i was greet by a veri friend person behind their counter that offer to make me a cup of joe

their coffe was congeni and pleasant  they had a limit amount of the normal coffe hous accompani  a few pastri and cooki to coffe  they seem to be more of a café or dinner base on what they are offer their custom  pizza at a coffe hous  now that differ  

they have a huge select of pizza sandwich and wrap  salad and a few breakfast and bunch option as well  

it was veri difficult to get as comfi as i do in most coffe hous but then again im not sure this is realli a coffe hous but more of a café slash gift shop  noth against the owner and i dont blame them for tri to maxim their revenu through addit avenu other than coffe  but you might consid chang your name to hob nob café and gift shop

thi is a cool place to meet peopl for lunch you dont know  

hear me out  their tabl and chair are not veri comfi so it make it easier for you to end your convers  this can be a good thing you know  as an old laveen even though im onli 24  im still old it crazi to see field develop into someth differ for the longest there use to be field worker sell their surplus crop and now  there is a strip mall where a field use to be and on the north east corner of said field is new and huge jumbo buffet

i first went to jumbo buffet dure their grand open we enter into their brand spank new place and saw a veri clean and kinda tacki dine room i gotta admit  i think it kinda cute but just kinda but what i do like is their gigant plasma hung high in their dine room it on but it mute and you dont notic it unless your look for it despit it size they have uniform and friend enough staff but mani thing get lost in translation

i thought they had decent food  noth great but decent they have a huge variet of food that attempt to be better than the run of the mill chines buffet howev  becaus there so mani dish the cook realli cant concentr on the dish they do put out so subpar all around it was crazi busi which is to be expect howev  we were frustrat with our server who had troubl understand us and get our drink refil was an uphil battl 

one funni thing is that the buffet featur a veri well maintain mongolian bbq and someon ask for a hot dog yes a hot dog what was even more odd was that they had it lol pretti soon everyon was devour hot dog 

recent i ventur back to jumbo buffet i was disappoint to see that they rais their price to 11 a person and their american food was slip no longer were their roast potato and onion were these light crispi chunk of good  now they were oili and onioni hunk of mashi  blech the sushi is just as mediorcur as it was the first time i went howev their salmon maki was decent their soup  i wouldnt trust their soup nuff said the sweet  sour chicken was the biggest disappoint  the first time i went it was fresh and yummi this last time  it was dens and hard and it hurt my teeth to bite into it ouch 

what did stay good were their mani seafood select the octupus still scare the crap out of lil kid their fri shrimp was still good as were their crispi egg roll the mongolian bbq is still well maintain and thank everyth was at a nice cold temperatur their orang chicken was yummi and or cours the hot dog still stole the show 

i would like to suggest to the owner of jumbo buffet that they close the smaller dine room that is obvious a differ store within the strip mall and rennov it into a hotdog place and if they were to bring back the old potato  onion dish in place of fri  that would kick asscame by for dinner buffet last friday paid 11 plus tax  bewar if you order anyth els but water to drink you will be charg at least 150 for it  i arriv sometim around 4p so i wasnt sure id be charg for lunch or dinner  id alreadi visit the buffet line twice when i notic there werent ani crab to be found i was told that they were still cook  im guess that the crab were place in the buffet line around 445p

love the frog leg  these will be one of the first i will sweep up on my next visit  i also enjoy the bake mussel salmon roast cinnamon sweet potato chinesebbq pork from the grill and fivesp crab  i also spot crab leg but thought id save those for my next visit  i also ador the steam bun the differ textur of the bun were perfect with red mung bean insid and especi the lilyleafwrap sticki rice and red bean for my sweettooth  there werent mani when i saw them there were onli two actual and despit my inquir for more none were brought out

lik the omelettop sushi  coudnt tri the other as they contain allergen  tri the sashimi even though they still look and felt frozen  i end up trash these  i took a few piec of octopus to the tabl and like the two bite i had befor sit down  howev after have a few bite of the other food sampl i went back to the octopus pcs and it felt like i was chew on leather and the tast wasnt that faroff from leather either  even though i had my fill of sweet with the red mungbean bun and sticki rice i had to tri the softserv ice cream  jb need to enlarg their top area i ran out of oreo cooki bit  i didnt tri it but i spot a greatlook strawberryrhubarb piei took a trip out to goodytwo to see about stock up on littl gift of toffe for the holiday the woman gave wonder direct to help me find the shop 

the shop is beauti 
the packag is beauti 
the toffe is beauti 
everyth is beauti 

it is also expens 

i realiz toffe is not an inexpens product to make but i think a lot of the cost at goodytwo come from the packag  which is beauti but i would rather my gift give dollar go toward the consum treat 

i did drive all the way out there so i couldnt bear to leav empti hand i bought a small packag of the doubl troubl and a small packag of the 2 alarm peanut brittl as gift 

person i think there too much chocol on the toffe  it cover top and bottom of cours i say that and then i go and buy the doubl troubl but hey you might as well do it if your gonna go there right besid peanut butter cup 

anyway it certain a classi look treat but for the money i dont think ill be load up on toffe for all my friend sorri guy youll have to purchas your own if you want it mayb we can split a bag everi onc in a whilei dont love district 
it someth that i medit on all day befor sit down to write this review i have final come to term with the fact that i dont love the newest downtown phoenix gem i simpli like i had my first visit to district last night after i made a last minut decis to go celebr my birthday a littl earli with mr hotti i was a littl worri about get a reserv at such short notic but to my surpris i was abl to secur an 830pm reserv over the phone 
we arriv dress to kill and feel excit to tri the new restaur we opt to use the valet which is free for the first 3 hour of your visit when you get your ticket valid we were greet veri warm by the valet attend and direct to the restaur when the door to the hotel open the first word out of my mouth were oooh pretti the open floor plan of the entir place was just breathtak as we walk toward district i even notic the new hotel smell which was nice
when we got to district we were met by the hostess who found our reserv and walk us to our tabl we were seat close to a big pictur window with a nice view of the street our waitress anastasia introduc herself and subsequ butcher mr hotti last name under the assumpt it was also my last name and said heard it was your birthday happi birthday ughmayb i was just hungri and cranki she ask us if we had been there befor and went on to describ the style of food and when i ask who her chef were she ask if i was with starwood umno i didnt let her know that a review would soon be written about this new spot after she finish stumbl through who the chef were we were given a basket of black bean  corn roll with a jar of chow chow  a flavor butter drizzl with honey i wish the roll were warm i think they would have been so much better and possibl releas the full flavor of the butter i tri the chow chow wow i was immedi transport to louisiana at my grandpa kitchen tabl talk about fresh crispi and tangi good we order a drink befor dinner i had a glass of mumm brut sparkl wine mr hotti order the ocean martini after our waitress stumbl through the ingredi of each martini she couldnt rememb the name of the alcohol that were use in the drink after a bit it was like we were play a round of an alcohol theme guess game slight annoy but again i thought mayb i was be over critic it was time to order the food 
to start i chose the chicken tortilla soup mr hotti chose the local field green and herb the soup was serv in a larg bowl that came with dice chicken dice queso blanco dice avocado a larg dollop of sour cream and thin strip of tortilla chip the soup is then pour over the ingredi talk about delici the soup was creami and savori the onli thing i wish it had was just a littl spici kick but the soup was so good on it own mr hotti said the salad was just ok the dress seem to be a littl light in flavor that the goat chees over power the salad flavor 
just prior to have our main entre serv we had order a glass of wine to go with our meal we were well into our meal onc the glass arriv point off oh well on to the main event
for my entre i had the grill ribey rare the steak came with skillet potato toy box tomato and was top with chimchurri the steak was perfect cook and the meat was extrem tender i was delight by the qualiti of the meat the onli bad thing about it was that it was a veri fatti steak even for a ribey it should have been a bit more trim up the tomato were fresh and provid a nice bit of acid to the rich plate of meat and potato mr hotti had the brown ale short rib the entre came cheddar jalapeno grit and the meat was top with roast carrot what can i say about the dish the grit were an absolut tragedi they were runni and came with a skin over the top of them the grit were just soupi and disappoint the short rib was veri good it wasnt fatti rather it was a rich slice of meat that was well season i didnt tri the small bit of carrot that came on top of the short rib but they look veri good for dessert i was offer a complimentari hot fudg sunda i was full but accept it for the sake of tri it the sunda came with a cold browni the hot fudg was lukewarm chocol sauc  so yes you guess it point off our waitress come fumbl back to our tabl to deliv the check and state that she gave us the wrong and subsequ cheaper wine ah point off  a neat end to the meal was the free cotton candi i dont know if ill return to district mayb to tri some of their other small plate and have a few drink it just isnt the great dine experi i was expect and im ok with thathigh blood pressur folk watch your sodium intak at the district

i had high hope come here  nice look place friend staff impress menu  i gave it a shot becaus realli there no way im step foot in the hooter across the street

i have this thing with scallop so when i saw it list on the menu it was no contest  howev list underneath was mushroom pepper grill italian sausag  sausag  oh dear but i dont eat pork  i ask  the waitress if there was anyway i could substitut the sausag for the grill asparagus list under the side portion of the menu  she explain that the scallop were serv on top of a mixtur of the three item but i could choos to have it serv on top of the asparagus instead  sure whi not  that sound good  i also order the bake tomato soup becaus of all the great yelp review and good lookin pictures

whil i was wait for my food the bread and butter came out  the bread was sprinkl with what i think was fanci sea salt  neat but was this possibl an indic of the meal to come  soon thereaft my soup came out  i didnt even get tomato soup when i was a kid but i feel like this soup brought me back to childhood  it was creami not overseason at all and the chees on top was just right  i suggest save one of your dinner roll to dip in it and you my friend have quit the meal  

the soup was pretti hot so it took me some time to finish it and by then my scallop were readi  my bowl was taken away and in it place were my scallop in the oddest shape bowldish ive seen  it was like a huge bowl with an asymmetr curv so that it like your food is perform for you in a miniamphitheat  it great for present but a pain to actual eat off of  i had a hard time rest my utensil on it and it left no room to use a knife and fork  made me long for the day of plate and flat surfac  the scallop themselv 3 huge one were sear to perfect on top of a bunch of suppos grill asparagus  howev everyth on the plate was over salti  i thought mayb my switch of the other ingredi had somehow upset the balanc of the poor scallop  was this sodium fiasco my fault  i ask for more bread to counteract the overseason salti of it all  ala my effort were in vain  it was just too salti  i went through 2 glass of water and 2 dinner roll  my server apolog and ask if there was someth els i would like instead but by then i was too full from the water and bread that i just ask for dessert

mi server came back with the menu and as an apolog she said dessert was on the hous  horray  i want someth nice so i ask her what the prettiest dessert was im a sucker for plate  she suggest the appl pie whoopi pie and sinc she was a chocol lover the chocol cake call heaven can wait  wow realli  ill have that 

the chocol cake was simpl but decad drench a rich ganach and a sea salt chocol stick cmon what with the salt  nonetheless i still through enjoy the chocol it was the perfect amount of sweet to balanc the salt

al in all i expect more than what i got  one pleasant at the end of my meal was the free cotton candi with my check one not so pleasant surpris was the 1 charg for the distil water i was serv  great staff veri friend but ill come back just for the soup25 start for realli crappi service
for such a nice place youd think theyd have better servic  holi frijol it suck  i went for the game night that glenn and bri plan  i final saw a guy walk by in a suit and said in my notsoquiet voic ill never come back here again  he came right to our tabl with more yelper and said are you guy the yelper  i had to actual rais my hand like in 3rd grade the rest of the night to get refil on my drink
th food was good  onli good  the crab cake were awesom  huge hunk of crab and onli crab coat with a light crumb and serv on a sauc with real horseradish  the fri  not so good  their onli save grace was that they were coat in old bay season  they were just normal shoestr fri though
i realli doubt i would go back just to eat  
the ambienc is realli nice though  i just think that for a hotel restaur which in itself is in the hospit industri theyd have better servic  at one time our server even chang color  he said he was from cuba  i call him fidel  he laughi know i enjoy food when i think about how good it was laterlik day and day later it has been about a week and i am still crave the mac n chees i inhal dure my happi hour visit the macaroni was cook to perfect the chees was the perfect consist and textur and the addit of spici sausag realli set the dish apart 

while the servic was imposs slow everi waiter i came in contact with was extrem nice but nice or not i was suck on melt ice for half the night while i wait to get my drink refil no bueno 

the atmospher was relax and casual and the bathroom were fabul well lit great aroma and my choic between cloth hand towel or paper the bathroom had well place mirror which made the space feel big and clean

i will definit come back but next time i might sneak in my own drinkim write this from the perspect of someon who is current avoid sugar and has alway hate spici food one might say avoid eat thai but im not a person is easili dissuad 

order was difficult due to me and my funki restrict  it went someth like this 

me im tri to avoid sugar  what do you suggest

waitress are you like allerg to sugar becaus we have noth that doesnt have sugar

meno not allerg just tri to avoid it what about the duck

waitress duck price have gone up dont have any

m the beef salad with no dressing

waitress sure how hot

m mild



i was then brought the hottest food ive ever eaten rather than be a total brat and send it back i attempt to get it down ive never been so hot in my life i felt nauseaus the room was spin i down 5  twenti ounc glass of water i dont get how you spice lover do it   it was trueli pain to eat  

so i know this was not mild becaus my cowork got the tri color curri also mild and it was perfect a nice subtl heat that build as you eat the dish not someth that knock you on your a on the first bite i realiz heat level are hard to regul but it one of my major pet peev when a place cant show some consist when both dish are mild and one is 10x hotter than the other there an issue

on a side note the tri color curri was fabul and addict and i complet understand the love it get one of the best curri ive ever eaten although im hard an expert in curri 

after lunch my cowork and i were both feel pretti lousi all afternoon not stomach lousi but i want to pass out lousi had troubl stay awak killer headach etc after eat freak lettuc  a few ounc of slice beef and 2 bite of curri i shouldnt feel like crap i suspect too much msg but i know im pretti sensit to msg so other may not be affect 

overal it was cute homey and the tri color curri was damn good it will probabl be awhil befor i return  the msg and the rage heat level on my mild salad have scare me off came here for lunch yesterday and the food was pretti good 

you walk up to the front and put in your order and then go find a tabl we came here befor noon and it was pretti busi it actual die down after noon it take about 10 minut or so mayb more for your food to come to your tabl so dont come here if your in a rush 

some of the order come with bean and rice and other with just chip and they bring a green and red salsa to your tabl i had a carn asada burrito with chip and it was just enough to fill me up my boyfriend enchilada meal came with rice and bean the horchata was pretti good ive had the homemad stuff and noth compar but not as good as the one you can get from a beto place 

the guy take order said their carnita and blacken chicken were their specialti so ill have to tri one of those next time i stop bythis place has decent food cute atmospher but the servic is problemat i was stuck in mesa for train and had lunch there on halloween my pal and i order lunch and about 20 minut later it arriv minus the condiment we order earlier sad our server was no where to be found and then when she final check on us i ask again for ranch and she said sure like it was the first time she heard the request anoth ten minut pass and final she rememb the ranch and bring it by at this point the fri were cold so it was kinda pointless i understand this is mere wpp but most other place can figur it out so mayb this spot can up their gameup front apolog this is a slight rework review from other ive done on brazilian bbqs in the western state and know that id like to have given texa a 375 star if it exist but have given the new fogo in lv 4 star main for the meat qualiti 

our famili is brasilian here in orang counti ca we and our group of friend have tri just about everi churrascaria that open or is still open in the southwest mani of us dure busi travel have also had the opportun to sampl us base brasilian bbq both on the east and west coast and some inbetween placeslik salt lake citi ut restaur review need a refer point and brasilian bbqs most especially

ov the last 20 year weve watch them come and go some veri good some horribl yoli of las vega for exampl and imho is on the horribl end problem with the brasilian bbq restaur is their abil to be consist while good food is a necess the style of servic call rodizio is critic and well train gaucho or meatserv are usual the breakpoint as to whether a churracaria is go to be rate high 

consid that most review have had limit exposur to tradit churrascaria in brasil a churracaria can be a contain in a bus stop  gas station area or as a fullon upscal standalon restaur regardless of size or ambienc it primarili about the qualiti of the buffet meat and the servic exampl the servic here was excel that probabl true and understand if youv never had a server bring filet to your tabl multipl time but excel servic at a brasilian churrascaria includ a gauchoserv that know his meat ask you for your perfer know how to pass your tabl and show what avail without disturb your eat and again they should be more than will to help you with special requests

what you should expect from an excel churrascaria is a hot and cold buffet style entre and salad bar in brazil and at high end establish this includ high qualiti sushi and sashimi and of cours rice black bean and various vinigrett and dress if you are a vegetarian a great churrascaria should be abl to keep you as full as your carnivor friend with equal or better qualiti item servic and food are usual what brasilian speak of when chat about their restaur experi it a threepoint system and proper rate you would seper them rate them and then total up the score

travel through the us my opinion is that there are no great brasilian bbqs fogo de chao in dallasft worth so far is the best experi ive had while their bever hill locat was veri dissappoint t de b is adequ but definit not great  

if meat is your pleasur then make sure to let the gauchoserv and staff know your prefer if you dont want to wast time on chicken and bacon frufru item then just tell your server to for instanc just bring you rare filet tritip call picanha peecahnya or whatev you prefer if you arent get rapid return servic on the meat then by all mean and becaus your pay for it let them know you shouldnt have to but if want to enjoy your meal get that issu resolv earli on

id say that texa de brazil is worth a moder 3 star rate if compar to fogo dallasfw locat it is certain much closer to tradit churracaria than ani of the lv strip hotel restaur ive tri them all and was sore disappoint if your in the socal area and close to john wayn airport tri agora at main and mcarthur if in the long beach area a good blue collar consist ok spot is greenfield 

if you travel to boston miami or the new jersey area youll find larger popul of brasilian and better food overal just dont get too excit over texa de brazil yes it way better than most other spot in town but i promis there better

btw most of the churracaria run a bit high on mix drink and also the dessert but if theyr good theyv prepar them in housthis review will probabl get lost in the 100s that have preced it but i feel like my opinion should be known anyway that so yelpi of me  

honest it realli not worth it to eat at this restaur great servic and pretti good food but i have had a waaaaay better experi at a churrascaria for way less im talk 26person for buffet and that restaur offer snake allig etc in addit to the normal varieti so i was not impress by texa de brazil

first of all their meat werent veri exot they had chicken beef pork and one lamb varieti they had garlic and baconwrap variat but that was it furthermor they were just okay noth that made me want to drool

ric mash potato and the banana were veri good side dish but you are at this restaur for the meat right my favorit thing was the pão de queijo aka cheesi soft delici heaven bread

w got free cake it was our anniversari and my man birthday just a few day befor that was a nice touch so i did write a rave review about my waitress on the comment card but unless i have a coupon i wont be come back heresometim i go into a place and then i start to think that itd be dicki to write a bad review of a place realli id like to give this place 2 star but it get one extra one for no reason other than im feel nice

i order the chicago style vienna beef hot dog i ask if they had more than one type of dog to choos from becaus i prefer schnauzer just kid lighten up peopl anyway the owner presum told me that they onli have one kind the best kind sure you do pal i prefer like polish firedog which some vienna beef place have or mayb polish sausag make all your littl joke go ahead but as a general rule ive never had a vienna beef hot dog i didnt like

wel this seem to me to be more of a bar than vienna beef and i felt total aggrieved

mi pal chris g a man among men who yelp spare had a chicken gyro which he said was so dri he had to eat it in the rain whatev that mean the fri were lackluster

so im gonna give this place 2 star but i guess ill put three up there becaus i just feel baddo not even attempt to go here for lunch dure the week between 1130100 there are xavier kid everywher 

you know what just stay off camelback all togeth youv been warnnow we stand at a crossroad perhap a dilemma is it truli mexican when it not made by mexican is a taco a taco just becaus someon said it is or a burrito the philosophi and debat of mexican food can go on for hour but i like to think of it like this if it tast good who cares

thi is the case with two hippi beach hous open by the same two hippi andi and jan goldstein who brought us two hippi magic mushroom burger they use word like taco and burrito but never actual say they serv mexican food

what they do serv is an access most delici wellpric menu realli ani three taco are 5 anytime

if youv ever been to some of the surf shack in san diego youll notic it like they pick one up and drop it on the corner of camelback road and 5th street â€ san the sand of course

in true two hippi fashion everi squar inch of this small establish is absolut cover with kitsch of all kind such bliss tacki the front is about the size of a postag stamp bare enough room to stand after order at the counter onc your order is readi they call out your name you can take your stash home or go around back and pull up a picnic table

whil you wait take in all the decor though if you have some condit of ocd you might have a problem with the clutter and want to start arrang and organ i had to put my hand under my seat so as not to give in to my secret urges

th emphasi on the menu is taco as well as the hot dog and lemonad two hippi also can make ani of the taco flavor into a burrito like the red beef 5 the burrito are massiv if i had to guess iâ€™d say they probabl are close to a pound they are load with tender red chile beef rice and bean and they fill you up big time

th chees crisp with chicken 450 is also huge and fulli pack with tender chicken onion guacamol tomato and cabbag itâ€™ much lighter than the burrito but still veri filling

on anoth other visit i stuck with the taco order up the taco 3 pack 5 and choos fish cactus and chicken these taco are massiv like all the food at two hippi youâ€™ll never leav hungry

interest two hippi doe not use corn tortilla opt instead for the medium size flour variety

im alway leeri about order fish sinc we live hundr of mile from the closest ocean and on one visit my instinct were spot on the fish was so strong i could onli manag a few bite even with the delici red salsa it couldnt help that poor fish

although anoth visit reveal the fish to be spot on flaki and mild so the fish taco could be a crap shoot the chicken taco was a chicken taco good with a nice balanc of veggi and meat howev my favorit was the cactus taco tender slice cactus top with cabbag onion tomato rice bean and cilantro the cactus had a delic sweet flavor and with so mani textur was a delight to chow

beach hous also serv up sever differ top all beef hot dog i had the pleasur of tri the no 6 375 which is pretti much the kitchen sink model a soft squishi bun cover with pinto bean chees jalapeo mustard ketchup mayo and guacamol whew this is like the daddi of all hot dog i think this could have been even a plain dog and i would have love it
im not sure where they get their hot dog but the meat in this one was just so tasti the top onli ad to my pleasure

ther are eight other hot dog that also piqu my interest like the no 4 4 that has feta pestomayo bacon tomato and onion and the no 8 375 which is cover simpli in guacamol i had forgotten how much i enjoy a good hot dog look out costco

with 16 base flavor the lemonad 3 are a great way to to complet your meal they use shave ice so it almost like have a slushi â€ complet with a brain freez if you dont take your time you can also combin differ flavor to come up with your own custom lemonad flavor the fun part is tri your differ creation cherri and raspberri were nice and tart but one combo was even better the strawberri and peach for me this almost had a creami from the round flavor of the peach this could be my signatur drink on ani upcom visit if there werent so mani other choices

two hippi beach hous doe a pretti good job of bring the walkup taco shack to central phoenix and it certain entic all sort of peopl so if you decid to check this place out and you see a big bear stuf his face with a yummi hot dog or one of the cactus taco pleas feel free to say hijohn cutter is a fun littl restaur it is total aok in my book  here whi i think it is ok

1 decent size menu with a lot of interest option  lot of your tradit stuff with littl twist to make them a bit differ from the rest  we went dure breakfast so i will focus on that for now  a coupl of exampl of fun food would be the breakfast quesadilla crunchi french toast and a breakfast philli chees steak i look over the lunchdinn menu and it has a lot of thing that look tasti as well  it isnt a huge menu but ok overall

2 the flavor of the food  i had the breakfast quesadilla with steak and i was quit pleas  you get a huge serv becaus they use the biggest tortilla ever and layer them instead of fold them in half  the quesadilla was stuf full of egg and chees with an ok share of steak sprinkl throughout  it could have use a bit more steak especi for the 5 surcharg to add it but overal it was pretti good  the tortilla were crispi and held togeth nice even be stuf  my hubbi got the crunchi french toast  it was a fun twist on your averag french toast  it didnt blow my sock off but it was averag  my hubbi realli enjoy it though for whatev that matters

3  the price  the price all seem to be a 1 or 2 too high on the breakfast menu  the food was ok and with good size serv but it seem a bit high especi on the kid menu  the kid breakfast is 7 and the lunchdinn kid menu is 10  i guess they are go for a more upscal place with the price but they just didnt seem to fit

4 the interior is pretti especi right now with the christma decor up  there were big wreath along the wall huge snowflak everywher and even some mistleto  it had a rustic cantina look mix with a bit of modern leather accent  it realli was nice decorated

5 the servic is on the mediocr side  everyon we talk too was super friend and polit  the problem is they were also absent most of the time and a bit on the ditzi side  my hubbi had a cup of coffe that was never refil or even offer to get a refil and the same went for my glass of water  we were check on about half way through our meal and when the check arriv but that was it  i dont think we are demand but a refil everi now and then is more than reason in my book

so over all john cutter has some good thing go for it but it has some miss as well  the food is tasti but a bit pricey  the interior is love but the servic level is hit or miss  when you averag everyth out i think 3 star is a good averagstop by to take home some pan de sal and pan de coco  wouldv purchas an egg pie for mom id have enjoy it too but lesli didnt have ani  i also purchas though i didnt want it some bibingka serv about four although it was miss the usual accoutr of grate coconut and salt egg which was freshfromtheoven  i thought lesli meant to have me tast it first sinc id never had it here befor but next thing i knew he was charg me for it  thus a lower rate

when i walk into the spank new store today one veri import symbol was visibl miss  the hot now sign  to me the best part of kk has alway been a gooey warm origin glaze right off the belt  it just melt in your mouth  instead i receiv a slight cold donut which did not even come close

i was told by the numer servic peopl some of whom were obvious still veri much in train that the donut are made in their central facil in mesa and transport sever time a day to each of their 3 phoenix neighborhood locations

in this past month weve been on a donut craze so ive eaten more than my decent share of dunkin rainbow and now kk  my conclus is that the independ run rainbow donut near cave creek and greenway is the best tast of the lotwhen you take a humbl hot dog snuggl it up with a chile pepper wrap it in bacon and top it with multipl condiment you can onli end up with one thingth sonoran dog

a street food stapl in sonora mexico and a high sought after late night nosh in the greater phoenix area the sonoran dog is a culinari marvel

on the corner of indian school road and 20th street in phoenix in a park lot of all place you will find a cart bear the name nogal hot dogsserv none other than sonoran hot dogs

a few picnic tabl and a popup tent are all that separ this street food vendor from other i sidl up to the cart and place my order sinc this was my first visit i ask to have my pair of dog the way the vendor like his for the paltri sum of 7 i got two dog top with tomato bacon mayonnais cotija chees and pinto bean along with a 16 ounc mexican coke old school glass bottl pure cane sugar frosti and absolut refreshing

from the first bite to the last i enjoy my sonoran dog experi although i would have like a bit more depth of flavor mayb more zest i would drop in on the nogal dog crew for a snack anytim if your in the area and feel a rumbl in your gut drop on in an have a coupl dog i didsushi roku use to be our favorit sushi restaur in the area weve been here to celebr an anniversari a birthday and fun date night whenev we got the crave for sushi unfortun the qualiti seem to have declin in the past year our most recent experi left a bad tast in our mouth and i dont think well be return ani time soon

w came here on a friday night befor the christma holiday and were surpris the restaur was play such loud club music we joke that we felt we were eat on the danc floor the ambianc just wasnt as invit or classi as it was previous thing went downhil from here 

the katana roll was not as flavor as it has been in the past and the present was differ for a 17 specialti sushi roll we were expect someth special and were left quit disappointed

th caterpillar roll was also not as good as it has been in the past i couldv sworn that this insid out roll use to includ crab meat insid but our server said that i must be think of their dragon roll i high doubt it becaus the dragon roll isnt even on the menu in ani case this roll was also quit disappoint and definit not worth the hefti 16 price the roll had a tini piec of unagi insid which was cold rather than hot and fresh cook 

all in all quit disappoint and sad that the qualiti of this onc 5 star place has declin to the point that i cant rate it higher than 3 starlasvegashilton weekend brunch is 1799 per person serv crab legsprim rib a full breakfast and more

they have made to order egg steakbbq ribsfri chicken loxbagel and cream chees plus they have lot of donutsrol and pastries

servic is good line move real quick so real wait plus the sportsbook is right there so you can watch the game while you wait in line

for under 20 for a weekend brunch a pretti good deal and the food is realli good so it well worth itnow that i have tri other buffet for comparison i am downgrad the hilton buffet  there take that mediocr buffet  hahave low expect about this place it actual allow this place to exceed expectations

stay at lvh we got complementari coupon to tri the buffet  know we were go to pay for a big dinner we want to grab a small snack beforehand  sure a buffet isnt quit a snack but i wasnt expect to eat much and sinc it was complementari the whole eat what i paid for concept that usual happen at most buffet didnt appli here

but the food was actual quit tasti  theyr current have their festiv italiano  i tri a few item  a coupl of their pasta dish some meat from their fresh slice section  they even have a made to order pasta station if you want to be so bold as to creat your own pasta dish

i was a littl bum we couldnt have ani of the complementari beer and wine  appar that is onli for the weekends

overal a pretti decent buffet if your stay at the lvhfirst off i feel bad give this place just three star after read all the review i was realli hope to like it a lot more than i did ive heard for month from friend and fellow yelper about how awesom this place is so we decid to give it a tri for earli vday dinner 

the atmospher is veri veri nice nice littl cottag with a kitchen where they have a few tabl next to the chef a dine area and an outsid patio area there are lot of candl and can be romant place the waiter were all nice but we had some issu with the servic a group of 4 that came 20min later than usjust 2 sat next to our tabl and kept get food quicker than us the most annoy part was that the waiter kept tell us our food would come but the speed and servic was definit lack 

as for the food it was definit worth 3 star except for the main chicken pesto dish it was just two butterfli chicken piec with pesto sauc no veget no special sauc noth special i did love the appet 1 white bean soup with side of bread with asiago chees appet 2 barley and poach shrimp w sweet asian chili sauc and one of the main dish pork tenderloin with a sweet chutneyhint of curri sauc and asparagus the dessert was just some strawberri and fudg browni again noth special

al in all i did like the experi but the food left me think there could have been more or that it could have been better mayb i went in think too high of this place i am will to give it anoth tri but it not 1 that i would recommend to a friend

 i want to add someth chris the owner of the restaur sent me an apolog via email and phone call this say a lot consid chef will get veri offend if you talk remot bad about their foodcreat i have to admit i feel bad if i seem veri cruel in my review but i feel that i was not overexagger anyth i like to think that i speak the truth and hope reader can appreci that one last thing chris point out to me that the chicken pesto had provolon chees and spinach i am sorri chris i have a dull palat 

again i would like to tri cafe monarch again and will updat on my next visitcafe monarch dine concept is such a fun and excit idea fresh organ local sourc meatseafood and produc with a fun and excit new menu everi night depend on their find for the day for 4500 a person simpl and fun for foodi like me who enjoy tri new thing the problem with cafe monarch lie in the execut of their menu i applaud the new owner christian for all of his hard work and be a new restaur owner is never easi so if i were abl to have a convers with him regard his establish these would be my critiques

 the whole idea of a set menu is fantast and work with peopl food allergi is need but when you onli offer such a small select of item they should be execut to perfect there is unfortun no room for error there was perhap a continu issu between the cours i felt as though the meal didnt flow togeth and there were sever misstep with near everi cours 
on my most recent visit the amus bouch was a tast of smoke salmon with a pistachio  it was kinda a strang combo the salmon lack flavor and the pistachio overpow the delic piec of fish when we transit into our salad cours the pork belli that was in our salad was over cook to the point that the beauti smoki and fatti piec of belli resembl more of a piec of beef jerki  it should have been the star of the cours  but instead it wound up on the side of the plate that even the entre choic were a pork shank or a scallop the pork on this particular even was the real star  beauti cook tender and flavor the scallop were both high qualiti and cook to perfect but they lack ani sort of real flavor the desert consist of browni which were so over cook they werent even edibl the wait time on the particular visit between cours was unbear we wait near 40 minut between our salad cours and our entre it would have been nice to have some bread to munch on while we wait  they realli need to work on the time of the entrees

w order a coupl bottl of wine which were great and moder price they have a full bar when we ask the waiter what their special cocktail was he recommend their moscow mule when we receiv the mule in the proper copper mug i was excit but then i tast it  it was flavorless and lack ginger and lime 

the servic was fantast  our server was veri knowledg and was attent our plate were clear in a time manner and we were check on regular throughout the even 

the build itself is beauti and rustic and they have a love romant patio for those nice arizona even 

with a few simpl improv i see a long and posit futur for cafe monarch but without ani chang i cant see how the hype for this place could continu for long when your spend 15000 for two for dinner you expect just a bit more than what you are receivwas entic to have dinner here when one of the owner mention that on the 14th and 28th of this month the restaur featur 50 off  dont know if this is everi month i thought it would be 50 off everyth on the menu but upon arriv was given a menu with a few item that are 50 or almost 50 off  i ask her if they use rice wine vinegar for their sushi rice and she said yes  i was quit hope to see if theyv improv on it

th restaur was busi and there were at least three sushi chef busili work the sushi bar  i usual tri to dine at sushi counter of japanes restaur but the seat here are too low for me to enjoy the experi  measur at 50 i know im a shrimp but the counter here is too low for anyon to be abl to watch the chef in action so after tri one more time to sit there tonight i got up immedi and sat at the bar

aft studi the menus and ask question i final settl on the norway pepper salmon reg 5 now 3 and the bomb reg 15 now 9  the restaur was quit busi it took at least 25 minut befor the twopiec salmon sushi arriv  the present was quit pretti with an orchid and a coupl of sauc pineappl and raspberri for garnish but the sauc did not add anyth to the flavor of the salmon  i was quit hope that the rice would be much better this time i met anoth owner john who told me that hed read a review on a blog where the review mention someth about the rice  howev the rice tast just like it did on my second visit  he did come by to inquir about the rice and said hed tri to find out what the problem was

sinc i found the bomb 35 minut or more waittim under the the sushirol menu the descript state bake spici scallop with salmon wrap spici tuna i expect to see rice in this dish but the present was neither in sushi nor handrol fashion just said ingredi  no matter i still enjoy it so mani textur here  i love the plump of the scallop  i particular like how they werent chop into tini piec like ive experienc them in other venu  i didnt find the tuna to be spici at all  it was howev serv tartarestyl and so ad anoth textur compon to the dish  the salmon piec were beauti to behold and slice thick yet were velvetysmooth on the tongu and melt in my mouth  veri freshtast no fishi aftertast at all

i also order the pan asia beefsteak and grill salmon entre under the chines menu reg 26 now 13 to go  while i detect cornstarch in the sauc that cover them i did find the coupl of beef piec nice pepper and the sliver of salmon i tast to be delici  definit someth worth check out on the 50 priceplan  i did find it strang that this entre didnt come with rice either instead orang slice were wedg between the salmon and the beef  

btw i was abl to tast a littl bit of the green tea ice cream serv here it is exquisit  i was tempt to order some for takeout  from what i gather the dessert cost 6 and is serv with a warm banana a sauc and whip cream  a singl scoop will set you back 4i was sit at work wonder what the heck to eat for lunch i hop on yelp pop in my work addi and did a search after get a few result i settl on tri pan asia 

i hop in the gride and head over when i walk in to this strip mall locat i was veri surpris this was modern and sleek decor with flat panel tvs and cool music bump over head wow 

i decid to sit at the bar for my meal i was starv so i chose to go with the delux sushi combo i was just drink water and had to troubl 2 peopl to final obtain a lemon for my drink it was a slight annoy when my plate arriv i was delight by the present on the platter were 2 piec of yellowtail  a salmon a tuna a black pepper tuna and the dish usual come with 8 piec of spici tuna roll but i ask for spici yellowtail instead i was so glad that i was starv 

the qualiti of the fish at pan asia is soso it isnt bad but it not without a bit of aftertast and certain isnt the highest qualiti again you wont get sick or you wont be horrifi by the sushi it just middl grade 

on my second visit i got to tri the fire roll which is a california roll insid saute garlic shrimp all cover with eel sauc and bacardi 151 lit on fire it make a great present and is veri tasti for those who dont enjoy raw fish 

i would high suggest this place for runofthemil sushi i would especi suggest it for those who are with fellow diner who do not eat sushi as pan asia offer a full menu of chines cuisin 

i know that pan asia will becom one of my regular lunch spot for a quick sushi fixwa i like about big wa the most wa the servic  they were attent and polit without overdo the service

i went with my oldest daughter and we split an appet and one entre  the appet wa their version of crab rangoon  crab puff  they were pleasant fluffi and plump with fill the fill wa pretti good but could have use a littl more crab

i cant rememb what the name of the seafood dish wa  it wa one of those dish with a light white wine sauc and 67 type of seafood  most chines place have some version of this call happi famili or ocean delight or littl mermaid bit or someth like that  anyway it wa pretti good the seafood wa not overdon which i alway appreciate

pric were the go rate so we walk out after an appet and our seafood medley for about 16 buckso you wont believ how i end up here somehow i had it in my head that the wild wild west was the hidden gem of vega buffet well when jami w and i drove there we discov that it was a tire motel fill with frogvoic smoker next to a denni sure my mind was play trick on me as i realiz much later it was sam town i was look for but regardless we were jones for breakfast thank to the trusti yelp app on my iphon we zero in on waffl cafe 

surpris surpriseit in a strip mall just like almost everi nonstrip eateri in town it realli look like a smoothi shop sinc i couldnt tell if they even had a kitchen the overhead menu would have you believ it a virtual wafflepalooza in there perhap but i didnt hear the sound of a griddl or the plop of the batter which made me think the waffl are made elsewher and heat up in the back it was just too quiet in there anyhow both of us went for the 549 breakfast special  which consist of a larg round waffl a coupl of egg bacon or sausag and a cup of coffe 

i order the pumpkin waffl and had blueberri and whip cream place on top it was good and the meati sausag and scrambl egg help a lot jami show greater forbear and had his pumpkin waffl plain with a pat of butter but he weaken and went for the bacon all in all it didnt feel substant enough to be the breakfast we desir but it did tie us over until the dog we had at pink for lunch not becaus of the server who was quit nice and cheeri but i doubt if ill be back simpli becaus it is slip from my memori as i write this 

food  3 starsnic larg belgianstyl waffl but the oomph factor seem miss 
ambianc  3 starssur they sell jamba juic here dont they 
servic  4 starspeppi and respons 
total  3 starsjust not quit memor enough for me to return for a wafflone of the few asian shop center in the phoenix metro area  there an asian market various restaur thai vietnames boba chines and a few retail shop  it doesnt have the select or energi of the chinatown market in vega la or orang counti  kind of shock actual when you consid that there are 3x more peopl in phoenix than vegas

return factor  90  where els am i go to go for my asian fixi got a crazi boba crave tonight at like 920 my normal goto place the street wasnt answer their phone and i had no idea if they were open or not i like how i call this my normal goto as if i have been a custom forev let be honest ive been like twice but i like it enough to call it my normal spot

anyway so i saw this place and decid to check it out i call at 930 and the ladi said they close at 9 but still had custom so i could come i rush my behind there so fast for my boba i was not disappoint 

this time i decid to get a few differ flavor and put them in my fridg for tomorrow i now regret this decis but what can i say you do crazi thing when you need a fix 

so i got the following
r bean ok
green tea  no thank you
thai tea enjoyable
milk honey tea yes please

i drank half of the red bean befor it was too much and toss it it had a chalki textur i total toss the green tea after a sip and now i have the thai and my milk honey in my fridg for tomorrow

th cons
i spent 18 serious what the heck was i think 
they charg you 50 per drink to add boba and i think it was room temperatur my drink was cold but the bubbl were not i think they should chill them like the street doe it make them way better
and they charg to use credit so thank i had cash  

so i will go back if they stay open just for me and i am desper but if  the street is open that is my first choic 

thank you for give me my fix tfe you have a sweet spot in my heart


btw boba goe bad in the fridg it get hard and gross dont do what i didif your truli crave some true vietnames food then this is the place to go they offer such coloss portion and the servic is wonder too 
   howev it honest wasnt for me not my kind of tast but trust me if your a true vietnames food lover then this is your place of food
 it also conveni locat in a plaza that has other small restaur and a groceri store 
 have funyes the bean and chees burrito was good  yes im glad they dont use lard then it vegetarian  it was hot and cheesi  but it was just bean and chees  noth fanci  i wont rave over it
th chip and salsa were ok  i would have like more salsa but sinc you have to pay extra to get them in the first place i didnt want to get charg more
th highlight of dinner  the horchata  i even got a refil to go as i left
i will probabl go back but i wont be crave itamerica is a place that i had to visit more then onc befor i review 

it is good the carn asada was tender and had a nice char flavor 

the bean and chees burrito was good 

the chip and salsa were bland the salsa was tomato sauc as one of the 10 year kid said 

the price was a littl high esp 150 for each can of pop that is 9 a six packmy husband decid we should go out for a nice lunch today  that mean he wear a collar shirt and i wear someth other than my standard summer attir of an old tank top and short i would never wear in public  too bad the woman i just saw at basha didnt have the same philosophymi husband was temporarili blind when he wit the horror   i digress  we chose metro sinc we had onli been onc befor at the yelp adoptafamili uye last year and unfortun miss the yelp eat week

w arriv about 130 and were given the brunch menu  as both the websit and the menu list lunch and dinner avail at 11 am on saturday i ask for an altern menu  it was disappoint that onli brunch was avail for the next 30 minut and most of the entre were breakfast items

w went ahead and order cocktail and they do have an impress cocktail menu  i had someth with blueberri lemonad and a ginger liqueur  it was perfect not over sweet at all  sinc lunch option were limit we share a petit plateau 42 which includ shrimp clam and oyster  i realli have no idea whi i suggest this sinc im general not a fan of oyster or clam unless garlic and butter are somehow involv  the clam had an odd tast to me but i had never had raw clam believ it or not  the husband comment they werent clean quit to his like either  the oyster were veri nice onc i thorough soak them in lemon juic but hey that just me

sinc this raw shellfish lunch had virtual no calori i was not about to share a dessert  i order the sticki toffe pud whi do they call it pud anyway and it was the best  the cake was caramel and crunchi on the outsid and moist on the insid  the pistachio gelato was a nice accompani  i also tri my husband peach cobbler  there were two great thing about it  one the peach still had a nice bite to them  two it was huge and i am alway a fan of a big dessert especi when your sharing

our server was great and we never felt forgotten  unfortun the time it took to get food and drink was complet ridicul  the restaur was not that busi yet cocktail were excruci slow  the bartend certain did not appear to be stress  the seafood took so long that by the time it arriv i am certain the lunch menu was avail   dessert was at least 20 minut to arriv as well

i had so much time to kill that i found myself becom increas irrit by both my husband and the restaur  for exampl if they are go to put butcher paper over the tabl cloth then whi dont they chang the paper befor they bring your dessert   god know they have ampl time and i didnt necessarili want to look at the paper that was spill on and wet where the glass had been  yes i am posit it a pleasur to dine with me

overal i will come back and could easili see ad on a star or two if onli the kitchen could get it togethi want to tri sen more than onc befor i review it and now i have so i feel just in my time 

aesthet i enjoy sen it small but it out of the way so that fine i have the same chair in bar chair form 

the food i have to say is ridicul amaz so far i have tri the special spring roll citron tofu and  crap i cannot rememb the other one wasabi tofu well it so good i order seconds

i had a glass of wine onc which was fine you cant mess that up i tri the saigon martini last night it wasnt veri good evident the hot and dirti martini is the way to go but it made me want to hurl 

the onli reason i do not give sen a 4 is becaus of the servic the first time i went the servic was just not good it was signific better last night but when i ask for a drink suggest the waiter could not provid one 

there is noth terribl about sen but imo the food is except i will be back and i hope that by that time they have fix their servic glitch 

oh i have becom quit fond of the bathroomthe food was pretti tasti but it definit got a littl bit of the over the top not quit authent feel to it everyth seem just a littl too commerci to me which is whi i gave it a 3 instead of a 4

their sake menu is reason enough to go back but be prepar to spend a littl it is a tapa onli we order 6 tapa between two of us just to feel satisfi the cheapest tapa on their menu are about 4 or 5 buck but there onli 2 or 3 thing that are that cheap and i think they were most the vegetarian tapa most of the tapa seem to averag out at about 7 buck so with sake and tip you probabl averag out at about 40 a person i would definit suggest get a side of rice to help fill your belly

they did an awesom job of atmospher in the restaur and johnni chu came out sever time to make sure we were enjoy our food they also had a dj who did a great job of choos good music to play while we ate  im just not sure that the time was right for them not veri mani peopl in downtown are quit readi for a place like this on a regular basi 

sad we were the onli 2 peopl in the restaur for about half of our meal at about 730 on a friday nightok so i sort of promis amber w that i wouldnt give sen a bad review after a dine experi this weekend 3 star isnt bad but it not good either 

first off i have been here 4 time now and figur that is enough to judg the place is cool i will give it that a new hip downtown asian tapa place it a small menu in an even smaller venu but a place to be seen 

the have a good beer select and have my new favorit a japanes white ale it is realli tasti dalli enjoy the hot n dirti which is a dirti martini with chili infus vodka let just say it is an acquir tast 

on this particular night they were abl to accommod a parti of about 15 of us that was great it be such a small place here is where it goe south we order our love waitress morgan is kind enough to split everyon bill i order some sort of sugar cane pork i got it 15 hour later other diner food came out random if at all it was ok but i am not realli sure that is what it even was though the other time i had food there it was a shrimp and pork dumpl which was veri bland the one thing i have had which is good are the fri wonton thank georgi 

overal it is a cool place take a date there who has never experienc downtown and it will impress her or him whichev 3 star for now i will have to go back and give them anoth shotyogurt builderz didnt quit knock it out of the park for me  i must admit this review is base on four sampl but they were enough to decid id rather purchas froyo elsewher 

i wasnt wow by the qualiti and textur of the yogurt  the hous vanilla is solid as is the oreo  peanut butter and chocol were noth special  i didnt like the ice factorit seem like the sampl start melt realli quick  probabl explain the slight wateri tast  the top bar didnt grab me like at yogurtolog either 

the decor is nice  there a fresh young vibe to it you definit cant miss the flavorstheyr label with veri larg sign  pretti heavyduti machin too 

dont get me wrong the yogurt was just fine i just prefer a creamier product that can surviv the drive back to my apart814
came in for a late lunch  place was like a can of sardin with a line that wouldv form outsid the door had it not been so hot  instead we all cluster around the host podium  surpris i was seat almost immedi  see there are advantag to dine solo

the salmon sandwich was excel  everyth that compris this sandwich was fabul from the wholegrain and veggi bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slather on it to the ohsomoist mediumrar salmon tomato and the notsousu leafi top shiso  it took all my willpow to not eat the entir thing  i wish i could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash  the kale was so tough to chew  howev chew wouldnt have been such a task if the kale wasnt also veri dri  my salad was pretti rough so i abandon it right away  i know that kale is so veri good for me but sometim what good for my health isnt so great for my digest system    i wasnt a fan of their hash in the past and tonight side dish didnt win me over either  i wont give it anoth chanc  anoth disappoint was the onion tart  first the present left me wonder who took a chunk off my plate and ate it  no this was just how it was assembl and bake i was told  varianc he said  the exquisit crunch i so love in this pizza was gone and so was the flavor  veri bland  anoth menu item i must cross of my list  

oh but the dessert  veri moist cake which sat on silki rich organ dark chocol sauc with love  crush cocoa nib love that crunch  i think i surpris my server by guess correct what those nib were  ive had them befor in trail snack bag from whole food  the best part  whi the homemad butter ice cream  i need to go back and have anoth scoop or two veri soon

excel servic veri inform  kudo to my server who never show impati after have to answer all of my question some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few time too  thank you veri muchif i can tell ani of you dear reader two thing it is thispeopl who wear black robe are extrem picki about when you show upand if you meet one in an alley way behind a bar in tuscon they will charg 20 dollar extra for thing that should be included

that be said my southwest tour of remov for legal reasonsha taken my down a long and wind path so i am get readi to see the  again and befor it was time to go to  my  said that we need to eat befor the  bargain was go to be announced

i agre under few conditionsit had to be thai food and it had to be thai food on a nice sound streetand the restaur had to have a realli stupid name

her come ping pong on east sunset  ping pongi did a lot of that while  in that horribl  and and dream about it when i spent 8 month in the hole  okay i can do this let go  so we went in and i have to say and it isnt becaus i have spent most of my life in  facilitiesbut the girl who work as waitress are all veri nice look good beginning

on of these sweet young thing sit us down at a tabl give us menus and tell us she will be right back  i think she will make a great wife number 7  the lunch menu was complet with all of the standard favorit pad thai yellow curri hot and sour soup etc with the pad thai yellow curri and other dish you can chose your own meat

aft order we get a complementari bowl of soup which was veri good great coconut milk flavor  

a few minut later the food came veri good portion size and the qualiti of the food wasnt except but it was good  for exampl i pick the chicken as my meat with the yellow curri and i found two piec of gristl that should have been cut away befor cooking

anoth complaint is that i was ask how hot i want it and i like my food spici so i told her that not onli was it not that spici but all they did was ad red pepper flake as far as i could tell the broth of the curri was not spici unless i direct ate a red pepper flake so it appear to me they do what most place who serv the anglo dothey make it mild and they use a cheap way to make it hotter i am rex marvini can tell when you do that

which is a shame that their prep work was sloppi and their food made too pedestrian for the mass the other techniqu they use were great the veget were clean and cut well they had been proper marin in the stew and soup and they took on a great flavor the hot chick in great outfit were nice the portion were good the price was right

unfortun this is the case of exot cuisin be american to a point of lose what make it realli special

i tri explain that to the chef but i am not sure he could understand me with all the scream and my  pull at me and sob about all his hard work down the drain i like to think the chef understoodbut all i saw was fearal i heard was mad hope he was abl to wash those friggin red pepper flake out of his eye by now

from now on if i want thai i am either go to this great hooker i know who also doe this bead trick that is out of this worldor mayb archi sure i had to alley whip some punk last time i was there and i am ban but who is go to stop me

 i am rex marvin you are not3 12 star brought some client in for lunch sinc they pick ping pong thai this was my first visit here and we arriv befor the lunch hour which was a bless bc it get busi after the noon hour

start off with a thai ice tea  larg and refresh i went with the soft tofu pad se ew and request no broccoli the food arriv prompt although they includ broccoli i blew it off and didnt make a stink about it but even my client mention he heard my request the dish was still tasti and fill so i  was content

thi is my client go to place sinc it near their offic so ill return again here and give em anoth tristop in here saturday  morn after some friend suggest it and of cours i had yelp it  juli wasnt sure when they open 6am so i got there about 645 and the place was alreadi about 13 full  the waitress who appear to be old enough to be my mother made sure i knew about the senior menu on the back cover

th servic was pretti good  they initi forgot me as i had been seat in the front corner but after that i was check on on a regular basi  i am pretti sure all 3 of the waitress were senior and they put a lot of younger server to shame as they bustl around take care of their and each other custom  definit teamwork in play  mani of the custom appear to be regular as they chat with the waitress and folk at other tables

i may have order the wrong thing  i had the sh on a shingl with 2 egg on the side and a larg glass of orang juic  it consist of their standard white gravi with some shred of corn beef on top  the basic gravi had a pepper tast which i have had befor in diner but i would have assum the dish would be made with chip beef  probabl not order consist enough to make it worth while  even after eat my egg the gravi was scald hot and i was surpris it had not separ or film over which would have been my luck do it at home  total bill wtax 951 and i was full

overal the place had a good vibe to it  it open earli enough i want to stop in and tri some of the breakfast special that are onli avail on weekdayronni is a good place to have a nice breakfast or a decent lunch the staff is good they keep your drink full and will help you in ani way possibl 

we went for lunch i had a pastrami sandwich and it was good but not great there was noth that made it stand out and say here i am i am the best pastrami you have ever had while i am glad the food doe not talk to me i was hope for a littl more lol 

if i were a huge breakfast fan i would tri this again otherwis it will be in the distant rotat if i am ever stuck and cant find a new place to gowhen i found out that my cowork love pho i start dislik them a littl less just kid in case they read my review let not make this awkward for everyone

they were rave about this pho place realli close to work so we decid to make a lunch trip and reserv a tabl for 8 when we arriv at noon we found a mob of pretti disgruntl peopl insid wait to be seat i quiet ask if they had put their name down or anyth and was cut off by a ladi in full rage about be in line for a tabl becaus no one had taken her name down

to anger the ladi even further i grab a server and let her know we had a reserv for 8 in which we were immedi seat in the first 2 avail 4person booth unfortun for me i was face the angri ladi sorri yo we made reserv awkward look away

although this pho place serv a pretti big thai menu wtf i figur go for tradit vietnames pho was the way to go i got my usual roundey steak and brisket pho while my cowork went for the 1 all the meat pho our food came soon enough and after drown it in herb lime juic and chili sauc we dug in  

i have to say i have no complaint about the tast of the pho but i cant dare give it 5 star it was tasti as pho usual is but the broth wasnt particular aromat or flavor and the meat was not good qualiti  was it tasti yes would i eat it again sure would i take peopl here over other pho place in the area no way there are way tastier place with better compon nearbi at 8 it was a decent lunch but noth to rave my fellow yelper aboutgo against the grain here and give them 3 star i found this place thank to a yelp search and was realli excit with all the 5 star review im a seafood fanat i cant get sick of eat it i wouldnt be surpris if i have mercuri poison anywho we took a bus to leith specif to eat lunch here we arriv right when they open at noon we tri not to be the first custom i hate that the staff were all welcom we had plan to share a coupl item a must for me is oyster i cant get enough we order a dozen unknow they were enorm no realli enorm and way too salti i dont know if this is normal for scottish oyster as im use to kumamoto kusshi and fanni bay oyster im not a salt lover and my friend is she couldnt even eat these thank the west coast mussel made up for the oyster a coupl glass of sancerr also helphmm oh dear how the great can fall i came here for a wee birthday dinner with some friend as last time emili v and i came we realli enjoy it

th food was still good if in fact even better i order the same combo platter of tuna with crab flautus and this time my tuna was actual rare as request if a littl cold and the margarita are goooood i do need to give them that

but the servic left a lot to be desir the waiter was friend and smile and seem like a nice guy but it was incred slow at time border on arrog and veri cheeky

i arriv 10 minut earli to find emili v alreadi earli herself wait for two other we sat and wait we were one of two tabl i saw mani member of staff wander to and fro the waiter didnt look busi he never came over to our tabl but when i final manag to catch his attent and ask could we pleas order some drink he respond with yeah ill be over in a bit in a veri nonchal manner in a bit not a case of oh yes ill be over whilst grab his note pad it was liter a case of im not yet take drink order a bit turn out to be 10 minutes

fin dure the meal itself but when it came to pay we paid by cash it was taken away and not return we wait again and wait and saw him clear tabl serv other peopl still no chang eventu the polit brit in me overcam my anxieti of appear rude myself and ask for the chang to which he brought it over straight away this make me think he was hope we wouldnt ask for the chang and leav the in excess of 20 chang as tip which was realli quit iron consid how slow and nonchal the servic had been

it was also quit cold in the restaur when we first got there and i didnt take my jacket off until the main arriv a small note but when your eat hot spici mexican food you kind of want to feel hot and spici not shivering

now i dont know if i would go back their margarita realli are sooooo good and great valu i like i said the staff were nice not flat out rude but their attitud of serv us when it suit them and the veri cheeki trick with the chang put me off slighthave dine here most recent with amongst other a wee girl around the age of 2 ive decid that bop bop is a far better name than chop chop and that babi dumpl are alway a winner 

for the first time i final tri the unlimit banquet for over 6 person that £1995 per person for a good select off their menu  and as much of it as you want the onli thing is chop chop  bop bop fill you up pretti quick so by the time the first round of dish came to the tabl we were almost done

th lamb with cumin seed was contenti i like it but i agre it was a littl dri the aubergin and green bean were obvious winner as were the dumpl both steam and fri are goooood id say they were perhap the winner of the even and yes if you ask for babi dumpl youll get a big plate of almost three time the number of dumpl except mini they were for the babi but it was main the adult that ate them

on the other hand the fish ball yes fish ball werent that excit and for some a littl too fishi onli complaint though really

th servic is realli friend and effici too i guess the onli thing that get me is the ambienc or lack thereof it fine but just fine

it is great for famili with babi as even when said babi was get realli excit about the babi dumpl and be quit vocal it wasnt a problem for staff or other customers

i also think the key is do some sort of banquet here or at least all share whatev you order as the food will ljust show up whenev it readi they state this on the menu as a disclaim the onli thing that got to me a littl was the boil rice came out almost last after all the sauc has cool and well i mean it boil rice

definit great for a group of friend and babi and a veri hungri tummii had been look forward to go to the mission sinc the yelp offic hour event i was unabl to attend  the restaur is quit beauti sophist yet relax  absolut impecc servic from the hostess and our server

w start with the tablesid guacamol  although expens 12 i realli enjoy the option to adjust flavor or addin to my tast  it is onli made with one avocado howev so if your with a group larger than 2 or 3 youll definit need more than one order  chip were hot and crisp

i order the tecat skirt steak taco  simpli prepar tender and delici  but i will warn you these are littl itti bitti babi taco 3 with no accompani side dish  nice for me sinc im tri to learn the art of have a light meal but not for everyon  i was a littl put off by the serv size given the cost 10  i actual would not have even mind that if the taco were price individu and i could have the option of choos a varieti of fillings

so by now your on the edg of your seat just die to know whi onli a 3star rate  it was my husband lunch  he order the pabellon which is a sandwich of brais beef and pepper  i will admit i did not tri it but i observ the eat experi  the fill had so much greas that the entir bottom half of the roll was ruin  the top half of the roll howev was like a stone  he attempt to cut it with a knife he couldnt pick up the sandwich becaus of the greas and could not  he probabl should have sent it back  thank to the mission i am now tri to get the stain out of his new shirt that result from this eat fiasco  therefor my own experi was tarnishi am give 4 star but i am a littl skeptic about this restaur stay power i know it just celebr it 1 year anniversari but there is someth suspect about this place 

i had dinner here with my famili for my brother 28th birthday the interior is veri warm and dark there appear to be a nice bar area and the dine area was nice and open i did like the way they present the menus they had this leather bound cover and it fit veri well with the decor 

we start with a tabl side guacamol it was good the guy that prepar it gave us a play by play and had veri infomerci type voic a littl annoy i almost felt bad for him the portion wasnt veri big howev the chip and salsa were good but when is that bad the select on the menu is quit small and if you are vegetarian there are no option i had the swordfish with a shrimp cevich and rice it was actual veri good but the portion was small by eat out standard i actual it was probabl the perfect amount of food the pork and chorizo was a hit at the tabl as well i was also abl to tri the scallop they were good but a tad undercook 

here is what make me worri about their stay power the server to diner ratio was probabl 21 we must have had at least 7 differ peopl help out our tabl we notic a lot of other server runner busser hostess and manag mill about how can they afford to pay all of these peopl oh yeah the food is on the expens side 

it was good but i wont be rush back therei am torn between two star and three star even though the food was exquisite

short storygreat food but smaller than barbi size but full price

long story

i had the halibut that was over mayb two tablespoon of rice and had a delici tomato sauc pour around it that tast similar to campbel soup but better becaus i couldnt tast the tin can and it had a great layer spice to it that was just right the top of my fish was sprinkl with some crisp taro thread and my petit halibut was cook to perfect and season perfect veget were not a part of this meal 28

mi husband had the chorizo porchetta it was impress come out with a flame rosemari stuck into it i notic that it look like a petit filet  across the tabl in the dark but was a pork shoulder and the chorizo a hard style chorizo was stuf into it the plate had a veri tini dish of white bean pure on the side i am look at my measur cup right now and the dish look like my quarter cup but the dish of bean wasnt fill all the way so it was less than a quarter cup also veget were not a part of this entre 24 

both of us and the two tabl seat on both side of us thought it was too dark in the dine room you realli hurt your eye tri to read the menu in such dark no matter how young or great your eyesight is
th tabl are too close togeth so much so that you have to pull your tabl out of the way for peopl seat on the bench to get out servic was casual

petit protein less than quarter cup side with entre 12 cup is correct amount of food veget side not includedful pricei wouldnt mind pay 10 more an entre so we could receiv 12 cup side portion and a veget portion                              

 we will not returnin the area for a yelp event and in need of a veri quick bite we were limit to the food court and tt i perus their happi hour menu and figur it was a reason deal i have been diet late so was limit to basic just guacamol on the menu my friend order the nacho 

sinc we were in a hurri we  didnt make our order too complic food came out quick and it was standard noth amaz but i did enjoy that the spici guacamol i order actual did have quit a kick my friend enjoy her nacho as well portion were and we walk our in just enough time to get to our event on time even better our meal was just over 11 not bad ill admit for strip dinejust aok pho in las vega but veri good place in the southwest area of las vega becaus they dont have anyon around this area 

what i think do not tri tomato soup pho i was so disappoint becaus it smell seafood not tomato at all and veri oili this is a big no no no to me that the reason whi i throw up after ate here 

also im not veri happi with their spring roll  sinc im a big fan of it and after i tri it in mani differnt pho restaur 

howev ill come again let see hope it will be much bettera less than enjoy sunday brunch was had here recent and it was enough to make me reevalu my enjoy of vh

as a deli it great as ive said befor there a plethora of meat chees vinegar oil they have a good vari and unusu rang of savouri food for lunch and dinner everi day so if you were need a tasti dinner option didnt want to cook but still want homemad meal pop in here for a reheat delight serious tempt stuff their cake are also scrummy

but this is all for takeaway to sit in i realli havent ever had a love expereinc yknow when you want sunday brunch you want to cosi up somewher for an hour or two deliici food the paper warm and cheeri enviorn everytim ive sat in the staff have seem a littl fluster the girl are all love but there general seem to be an air of subdu panic 

most recent the boy and i came here his order was taken and i wasnt ask what i want as a result i order seper and my food came out 10 minut after his so hed finish his soup which was delici and sandwich befor mine arriv when it did the order was wrong id ask for egg benedict without hollandais i cant stand the stuff it came with hollandais i saw the girl write down without on the tab so it must have been a misread in the kitchen it was duli replac with a fresh one fine but this on top of my order be taken seper and arriv later than my dine partner left me eat it whilst he watch me without the same share glow of mmm isnt this sunday brunch love it felt more that right now my food here i need to eat it yknow

ok so that was a mini rant i do still like victor hugo for all the delici food it provid but the sit in experi has alway left me slight jade and this particular instanc put me off dine in again a piti realliif your a fan of az88 and are expect hanni to be a downtown clone youll be part pleas the design decor  ambianc will feel somewhat familiar as will the qualiti of drink at the bar asid from much smaller martini  but the food at hanni is a strang departur from the topnotch bar food found at it sister restaur in scottsdale

whil still bar food hanni offer an odd assort of pizza sandwich and salad and not a big assort either everyth we tri tast ok but sound better on the menu than it actual was portion were also disappoint for the price especi the chop salad which was half the size of the chop at az88  and half as good  for about the same price 

the ovenfir pizza had a nice thin crispi crust but top were just soso and felt uninspir sandwich select were more inspir but onli slight appeal from char pork to the pat a fanci blt made with pancetta and arugula the bar plate was probabl our favorit item though still just ok  fresh prosciutto slice at the bar on a veri cool eurostyl slicer chunk of parmigianoreggiano slice of melon and ciabatta bread  good but noth to write home about

what is worth write about is the place itself  a mustse and just what downtown need sleek urban and the coolest industri rehab around  from the clever open elev shaft to the maze of bathroom stall and onc the rooftop patio and basement loung open this place will sure be the hottest spot in town

a for now stop in check it out have a drink or two or three and enjoy the begin of a new era for downtown phoenix just hope the menu improv with agei would rate this place 35 star  i realli need my 5 star for mani of my review  again we pick this restaur part of it name and good review  the name is veri catchi and i wont phoget for a long time  howev their pho did not live up to it name  

it unphogett but not in a good way  the broth was a littl too strong  i think the cook ad too much star anis so it was quit overwhelm  dh order bun bo hue  he said it was onli okay  my friend also order pho bo and they thought the same thing  the servic was excel  our waitress kept ask if we need anyth els  

the owner also came over to say hi and ask about the food  i wasnt sure if i should tell her the truth or not  i end up tell her that everyth was great  i should have told her what i thought of her broth and mayb she should go easi on the star anis  oh well mayb next time

what do you say in this situatwhi hello dear friend   how is darl buffi today  good good so glad to hear she is recov from that absolut hideous pavement rash from the tenni court  dreadful

jim w belong to a countri club  perish the thought  jim w eat lunch at the countri club restaur bolero on a 2 for 1 coupon  certainly

i found the indoor dine area to be a bit stuffi and i might even ventur perhap a bit pretenti  perhap  shall we take our lunch out on the veranda  quit so inde  the view of san tan mountain is alway so splendid this time of year  do say

th servic was veri good in an obsequi sort of way  if you enjoy the feel that you are be fuss over becaus you might be a big macher look it up here httpwwwkoshernoshcomdictionahtm then you will get off on the servic here

i opt for a cheeseburg and fri  i was a littl disappoint in the fri thin slight coat and unremark  the burger was veri good  the set was veri nice

ok countri club lunch been there done thati think with time this place will be pretti awesom the food was pretti good for the most part and the servic was great and extrem friend we went on a friday night and the place was pack with what seem like veri happi diner 

highlight the pot roast was better then my mother ask for horseradish the lamp chop special was great and a super bargain at 18 buck the hummus was realli good but the pita was a problem was veri hard though i told the server and he brought out a fresh batch right away was good

al in all this place is go to be decent after they work out a few kink in the kitchen consid that they have never open a restaur befor i think that they are do a pretti good job though they need to qc the kitchen more

fyi 18 buck is the most expens thing on the menu though most itm are 12 and under seriosuli cheap eatthe husband is all about some good barbecu and first heard of dickey dure a recent visit to reno  when i mention that there was a locat in vega he was all over it

on of the bigger pluse on our visit was that i had an entertain book coupon for bogo free  score

w both decid on the 2 meat plate to maxim on the coupon and the varieti of food to try

 the 2 meat plate 10 signatur chop beef brisket and slice beef brisket waffl iron fri mac n chees  although it their signatur chop brisket the husband prefer the slice one more  the waffl iron fri could be season too  the mac n chees was veri creami though

 the 2 meat plate 10 spici hot link and fall off the bone pork rib fri onion tangler bake potato casserol  the spici hot link werent all that spici or impress sad enough  and the pork rib were just okay  we were expect someth differ from the bake potato casserol when all it end up be was mash potato with some fix  the onion tangler were just limp onion ring and were onli okay as well

both order came with a bread roll and you can help yourself to dill pickl slice and barbecu sauce

they also offer sweet tea in their signatur plastic yellow cup that you can take home

ultim it sound like a lot more food but in realiti it wasnt all that much  

overal it was just an okay experi with onli okay food  on the particular day we went there was a line go out the door becaus of a promot they were offer  other than that we probabl wont be back  it just didnt live up to the barbecu hype we were expective live around the corner from shari diner former under 2 differ name i think but ive never been there  whi  well two reasons

1 in my eye you are not truli a diner if your not open 24 hour and shari isnt even open late

2 the place is a kitschi 50s style diner and im not 12

nonetheless my girlfriend was in the mood for some pancak and this place is so close we decid to give it a tri  it was wors than i thought as far as ambianc  we show up on some sort of special night and they had a dj that was take request for oldi music  whi do i know this  becaus the creepi owner came over to our tabl and awkward told us so  on top of that there are obvious religi tie to this restaur and id prefer my food without be preach to

a for the food it was delici though  the pancak was one of the best pancak ive ever had and i dont even like pancak all that much  we also share some egg hash brown and biscuit and gravi  all were realli good and our entir meal came out to just over 10

if i find myself in the mood for breakfast food and it earli enough ill go to the bagel cafe  if i dont mind a drive ill go to blueberri hill  if neither of those thing work then i guess ill be back at sharieh this market was ok but it didnt do it for me

a farmer market is suppos to be a market for local farmer to showcas their fresh good for peopl to select buy and use as they will dure my visit i saw a grand total of one local farmer from phil somethingoroth sell produc  an itti bitti stand at that with mayb 4 type of veget from which to choos there were two or three other produc vendor one of them the giant mcclendon sell a boatload of attract produc from california and washington um i can get that at whole food there was some local oliv oil with no price list im sure it fab but with no advertis price and this be scottsdal uh uh

ther were prepar food and good and the like but that not what a farmer market is for nor is it what i seek in one i didnt feel ani communion with the vendor  some of them didnt seem to care much about what they were sell or even know how it was grown and travel from farm to farmer market mcclendon just look like an outdoor groceri store with multipl checkout lane and everyth i doubt veri much they could tell you the perfect time to pick that variet of appl or how to best harvest this type of potato much less have experi do it themselves

i understand this be arizona and all there not a lot of prime agricultur land to be util but thing do grow here  prick pear anyon tomato melon citrus herb but nobodi was sell those did i miss the part of the market where the actual market was

i give it a star for the mcclendon produc be afford and attract a star becaus they have a coupl of stand cater to pet and a star becaus their prepar good look just fine but minus a star for miss the point of a farmer market and minus a star for have next to 0 local grown foodthere onli one reason to order from napoli and that their 30 monster pizza  it is without a doubt the largest pizza i have ever seen  the initi reaction from other partak in this beast is worth the price alon  we had a parti of 6 and still had a ton of leftovers

i order at 10am on a footbal sunday  obvious a busi time for them so it took over an hour for it to arriv but no big deal  i was veri impress that i could view the entir menu make my order and pay for the pizza through the yelp app via eat24 with such eas  deliveri was the onli way i could get this pizza home unless i want to clean out my car trunk to make space or rent a uhaul anyway  

we order the suprem which had all the usual suspect for top  i honest thought the crust wasnt go to be veri good due to the size but it was alright  someon take a blindfold test between this and metro would probabl say metro was better but it all about the show with this piedont get me wrong  this is an awesom place just not for me

w origin plan to go to lolo but it was close so we head here as i knew they had chicken and waffl instead the chicken was over done just like my mommi use to make and the waffl well it was fanci not your normal waffl which is what i had kinda want dont get me wrong it was okay just differ and came with no syrup caus it was chees base and that wouldnt work so well

our real server was kinda push out by anoth server thank god as our real server look like he had a few year of substanc abus behind him and our new one was great we collect assum that that this our origin server last night at the place

that said my girl absolut love the food so take my review with a grain of salt also it should be duli note that the place is incred hip and beauti and drink price reason two great four peak beer ontap

so here the deal  go here and ignor this review sorri i wast your time 

oh shit i almost forgot  the free desert chocol cooki dough is the freakin greatest treat ani restaur has ever given me  evermeh  ive had better  

the decor was pleasant and trendi and the waitress seem veri friend well except for the guy who sat us he look like he realli didnt give a crap if we were there or not but the food was just meh  

i had the lemonad and it was a perplex mixtur of not enough lemon or sweeten  it tast so water down that i wasnt even sure it was lemonad and the sweet was just bare there  i even ask the waitress what it was to confirm that i actual receiv the lemonad  everyon is rave about it here though so i mustv had a veri bad batch 

we share some chees curd and they were veri tasti  horribl greasi but quit tasty

i got the lobster mac and chees  my macaroni noodl were mushi the chees was too greasi puddl at the bottom of the bowl and salti the lobster was overcook and chewi and the whole bowl was boil hot a tell tale sign it had either been under a heat lamp or microwav  not exact the wonder on a fork that i envisioned

mi husband got the meatloaf that was on special that night  the red sauc that it was swim in was veri spici in an acid way which is not a good thing and the acid natur of the red sauc clash bad with the more mute cheesi scallop potato that accompani the meatloaf

overal this as a pretti weak and expens experi at a restaur that i had much higher hope for   

ill tri it one more time to be fair and then ill decid for good if i just hit it on a bad night or if it just a case of averag food in a trendi set be over hype by soulless hipster who in a bitter twist of ironi have almost no tast of their own  

probabl the casei want to shop local   i appreci the fact that my local purchas support local peopl but i am not sure next  is realli interest in my busi  
the line on a wednesday was 4 or 5 peopl in  which first made me think it must be a great place but then after watch  i am think it just a matter of worker who are interest in be help  they appear to just leisur make the order with  littl enthusiam or interest when  i got to the counter i had a few question  i was wonderf about their holiday flavor  if it could be blend etc  but i felt as though get info or suggest was like pull teeth i felt embarrass like i was inconvinc him but i then i rememb i was pay them to make my order
when the equal apathet barista made my order she also refus to intereact or say anyth to me as i gave her my sweetest polli anna smile  she may have even grunt at me i hate grunter   guess the big chain will get my buck next time

pleas next  make an effort to engag the custom and tri use those nifti word  thank you  pleas and your welcom mayb even  glad i can helpif youv never been to a churrascaria or brazilian steakhous your first experi will like be 5 star simpli from the wow factor of unlimit sumptuous meat be carv tablesid and the opul of a lavish salad bar that could serv as a meal in itself  pretti much everyth i say onward will like be inconsequenti  howev if youv been around the block a time or two as i have and want the tale of the tape between two local heavyweight texa de braziltdb vs via brasilvb go at it for twelv round let get it on

round 1 ambienc 
this may come down to person prefer sinc there is definit an upscal vibe with sooth waterfal and romant light upon enter vb but not sure if i like the feng shui of the salad bar in the middl without ani partit of the tabl into separ littl room for ad intimaci  tdb definit has a more upbeat vibe with a casual bar area where you can await guest and separ littl room although definit more crowd and noisi sinc it is more bustl with turnov of guest   winner push

round 2 chees bread
if you took the most perfect chees puff and turn it into bread form this is pretti much the pinnacl of that transform  tdb has a slight cheesier flavor which give it a slight edg  winner tdb

round 3 salad bar
for firsttim or as i like to call them churrascarooki you never want to overfil your plate on the salad bar as tempt as it may be  howev it good to wet one appetit on some item to balanc the meat fest to come  i felt the overal qualiti was superior in the salad bar at tdb sinc they offer lobster bisqu and focus more on artisan chees and light seafoodveggi option wherea at vb there was one too mani pasta option like chees ravioli and other pasta salad which are like underhand tactic to fill you up to limit your meat intak  winner tdb

round 4 beverages
vb took a knockdown in this round sinc the waiter sat us down and present us with option for waterstil or sparkl and upon choos still he charg us for two bottl of some premium water at 7 bucksbottl without clue us in about the option for tap water sinc we assum it was complementari  they also fail to carri antarctica guarana the most popular soda in brazil and someth i look forward to anytim i ventur into a brazilian restaur  tdb would never allow the water fiasco to occur and alway carri my nonalcohol beverag of choic   winner tdb

round 5 open meats
surpris vb open with a bake salmon serv with passion fruitmango saucenot what i expect but realli good and the tablesid present was a nice touch  usual at tdb they start you off with some nonpremium beef wrap in thick bacon or some heavi porkchicken option  winner vb

round 6 lamb
leg of lamb was suffici juici and came with a nice mint jelli but tdb offer multipl cut includ the lamb chop which was unavail at vb  winner tdb

round 7 fowl
vb definit had some interest option includ chicken duck and chicken heart upon request wherea tdb onli has a singl dri chicken option which i tend to pass over to allow more room for other meat option  the chicken and duck were veri succul and tender and well season here  winner vb

round 8 brazilian sausage
lik the chees bread fair standard and not be a huge sausag connoisseur im not the best judg on this one  winner push 

round 9 side dishes
tak an intermiss from the meat i think vb offer some addit brazilian side like friedboil yucca root and saute turnip green which have a more stirfri crispi prepar compar to the stew version in soulfood  tradit favorit such as fri banana and mash potato are present at both  winner vb

round 10 beef
mayb it was the pace of the meat brought to our tabl but i felt that the overal qualiti of the beef cut were superior at tdb sinc there were a few cut that were over dri and tough at vb although certain cut were veri tenderflavor  winner tdb

round 11 service
waitstaff definit more attent at tdb and the pace of the meat parad was more even so i didnt feel like i had to overcrowd my plate and lose track of which meat was which  the tdb meat carver also wear a uniform that give them some more profession flare which i appreci  winner tdb

round 12 value
somewhat tie into servic the server initi took our groupon voucher at the begin but conveni left it off in our final bill until we remind him  take account the varietyqu of meatssalad bar would have to give slight edg to tdb    winner tdb

bi decisionwinn of this fight goe to texa de brazilbut dont count out via brasil in a rematch  a new fierc challeng has recent arriv into townfogo de chao so a tko may be in our midstyou know they say when someon like your busi theyll tell 1 person but if they dont like it theyll tell 10  ive been go to via brasil for almost a year and ive love it until recent  i still love the rodizio dinner which is expens but compar to other brazilian steakhous and the food is delicious

i turn sever of my friend on to vb as a goto happi hour spot  they use to have a bartenderserv name jule who was amaz  order were quick accur she was witti and attract which my singl friend appreci we would go week or at least a coupl time a month

sad i went back three time over the past two week and was inform by the hostess that jule was no longer there and their servic has plummet  the first of the three most recent visit involv delay drink argument with wait staff about how to split cash and credit card payment on the bill which are usual over 250 with 68 peopl and delay food orders

th 2nd of the last three visit the same delay occur  the waiter tri to blame the kitchen but when i ask about whi my bruschetta which take all of 60 second or less to throw togeth wasnt out after 30 minut and the rest of my parti was leav the waiter acknowledg he forgot to put the order in  then he put the order in and rather than comp the order he charg the full price rather than happi hour price becaus he forgot to put in the order befor happi hour ended

th last time i went will be the last time i go for happi hour  i went with two other peopl  one of my friend order was complet forgotten  we had troubl get anyon attent for new drink and we wait after we finish our food and drink 30 minut until one of us went to the bar to get our tab for our tabl  then after anoth 10 minut we end up have to bring the sign check back to the bar becaus wed basic been abandon at that point

i love this placelov my friend made fun of me becaus id alway recommend it  unfortun the servic at happi hour has so plummet that it not even worth it  too mani good happi hour to wast time here bring back julethe first waitress we got was just horribl we had a parti of 8 outsid and she ask everyon what we want to drink got 1 order and then walk away

sh came back ask if we were readi to get drink we said yes she took my order and my boyfriend order and walk away again

then she came back got 3 more peopl and left ridiculous

so my aunt goe to the bar order  her drink sinc shes obvious be ignor and here the interaction

aunt to bartend can i get a beer please
bartend the server will be with you
a she hasnt come out yet so i want to come here
serv walk up can i help you with something
a im get a beer from the bar sinc you left our tabl a few times
 that is a complet lie
a realli i have a tabl of 8 that can attest to you walk away from us multipl time when we want drinks
 that is just not true i was out there and none of you were ready
b snake away and get the manager

needless to say the manag came out said we were get a new waitress and she total rock our world she was much better we were readi to throw chang on the tabl and walk away from the terribl servic but our parti was so larg it wouldnt have been worth it

food was good beer was alright and half of the server seem to be nice

can i mention that the owner is total kickass he was veri veri friend let my littl sister in we were there with the famili even though it was late and was just total greata live midrang restaur the crowd was mix but was compris most of famili strang they play clubbi music in the background 

servic was realli good there were about five peopl servic our tabl as a team everyth came out quick and they were abl to accommod all the bizarr dietari need of our finicki group

th food itself was pretti basic the big eye tuna cevich was a signific deviat from real deal it appear to have small piec of tortilla chip mix in which through me off the chicken fajita were fine but werent a huge step up from someth you could get at a chain

fin word ok for a casual or famili dinnerlove restaur in the borgata typic trendi decor that the fox restaur have go for them  my girlfriend and i met up for marg and lunch on a saturday it was busi but we were abl to get a tabl right away  

our server was slow and not veri friend  i had the cucumb and kumquat margarita with shrimp taco  the margarita was far better than the taco  they were just normal shrimp taco  my friend got a chees crisp which look amaz and i would high recommend that dish to anyonwe visit blanco scottsdal for the first time and came away impressed

blanco is one of the fox restaur group place and it is a nice concept in upscal gourmet mexican food httpwwwfoxrccom

th chicken fajita were flavor at 1500 as were the machaca taco for 1200 and bbq pork taco for 1100 see photo the ground beef nacho 1200 plus 600 for a side of guacamol went pretti quick 

our lunch bill for a parti of four came to 6853 befor tip and everyth was veri good though admit some of the portion were smallafter check into our love suit at the montelucia my hubbi said he was in the mood for some chip guac and a margarita i think he had mistaken scottsdal for mexico and unfortun the restaur at the montelucia prado had none of the abov instead we enjoy a glass of wine riesl for me a bowl of gazpacho and share the snapper cevich  servic was a bit on the slow side but the tasti food made up for it

w end up back at prado the next morn for breakfast we were quit starv after hike camelback or part of camelback  i was a bit disappoint with their breakfast menu they had veri few thing to choos from besid the 25 breakfast buffet i wasnt in a buffet kind of mood but it didnt seem like we had a choic howev i seem to get the most out of my 25 after stuf my face with an omlett mini breakfast burrito fruit yogurt parfait etc  our waiter did a bit of a disappear act but fortun we didnt need him much for the buffet

they do have some good food but they could use some more optionsand better servici am back up on review frank  so this one is a coupl month overdu  

i met fellow yelper brian s here for lunch  i order the gyro plate as i want some greek salad with the meal  well the plate deal here are huge  two peopl could probabl manag just fine share one of the plate meal  lot of meat sauc fri salad dressing

i didnt finish and still i had no room for baklava after  sad

th decor is pretti basic  i would class them as a good lunch spot or cheap dinner joint not in the out for a nice meal classgood cheap eat with downtown atmosphere

aft read the other review i realli dont know what new i can add

thi place is no frill cheap  ok fair with ok servicenoth memor but the atmospher and cast of charact you are sure to run across here

if you dont wanna wait in a long line pay alot of  for littl gourmet dish and you like a littl pie with your mealgiv it a go

warn sit at the counter at your own risk high traffic and it kinda gross they put all the dirti platesetc in bus tub right under the counter in front of you as you eatthis place is decent if you want that teriyaki fix i usual get the two item combin plate it your choic of ani two meat come with steam rice and salad i usual get brown rice instead of white and macaroni salad instead of their basic hous salad

i paid a total of 1053 for this meal that doesnt includ drink you would think that pay 10 buck for lunch would get you somewhat of nice size portion but i finish my meal with no problem i think they dont give you enough meat and the rice was like two small scoop they also charg you extra for brown rice 

dont get me wrong the food is good but the portion and the price get two star subtract also a coupl time my cowork got food poison after eat here for dinner they were up at 4 in the morn hang out in the bathroom im surpris i havnt got sick yet for i have eaten here sever time i think sometim they cook the meat too fast and not cook it long enough 

servic is ok and the overal size of the place is pretti good to handl the lunch and dinner crowd they are kind of tuck away in a plaza just off the 215 and stephani exit 

so overal if i can just get a littl more food for the price i pay that would make thing perfect either that or lower the price a bit becaus spend 10 buck for lunch a day is consid a luxuri for some peoplmy date and i decid to tri someth new and stop at the lodg for happi hour  we were realli pleas with the price and all the bartendersserv seem realli friend  and the deep fri chees curd were to die for  i am from wisconsin after all  howev the bar stool are incred uncomfort  we didnt stay long but thought we like it enough to tri it againat a tabl next time

p  we couldnt decid whether to yelp about the soscantilycladitwasalmostinappropri server  i mean i know it a bar and shes work for tip butgeezuzit made us look around the bar for her polei came here for the first time last night and it was a okay  i like how the place was decoratedal wood like a hunt lodg but classi and clean

i came here for happi hour and they had some decent drink special  downer though was when i went to the bar to order a glass of wine i step on a veri sticki peic of floor  eeeeewww  it felt like someon spill thier drink and no one clean it up  my feet kept stick and it was disgust  whi cant they clean up if someon spill  it was obvious dri so it not like it just happened

i did not tri the food but servic was fine  i sat down with some other peopleand the server was come back and forth with food and take order regular  also got to see a few scottsdal douchebag here too  they were in uniform and everyth  strip buttondown top blue jean faux mohawk pointi shoe  fun if your into peopl watch that kinda stuff which i amlol

wil return again to tri the foodthe lodg is the manliest of man bar and when i say man i mean midwestern man put on your camo and trucker hat pack up your pbr jump in the f150 and head out to set up post and shoot some fn deer type of man there are stuf anim carcass and head everywher chandeli made out of elk antler carv wooden bar stool and bear ahem adam w carv wooden bear alert and tree log use in everi way possibl to decor i think there was also a fire place but i was so fascin by the post taxidermi coyot that was pose so mysteri on the mantl i guess it becaus anyth dog relat i am gravit to either way it alway interest look at someth so close that youv never seen befor that or im 5 year old 

anoth type of man is that they use grill chees sandwich as the bun for a burger my friend order serious  a hamburg patti with all the fix in between 2 grill chees mayb this isnt man asid from the abil to be abl to devour that much food  so mayb it just ungod fatti and unhealthi anyon particip in the fat off should not come here to eat at all and anyway i tri that burger and it wasnt the shit howev i did enjoy the criss cut fri and their ranch dress is to die for i need the recip now i crave that flavor

it an interest locat for a place like this to be hidden among the trendi brodeo joint that i avoid like the plagu i like the rustic feel this place had and felt like drink my maker on the rock was complet accept in a place like this i dont care if it an 85 year old man drink i love it and no one at the lodg look at me like i had 10 head when i order it like everyon els doe at most place i go plus it got an extrem decent outdoor patio area fulli equip with heat lamp for those brisk desert even waitress are nice and cute which is alway a plus and the bathroom didnt make me gag so bravo 

i dont see this place as becom a regular stop while in old town but i wouldnt mind go again they have a super happi hour thing go on 3 beer half price app 6 burger  beer cant beat that plus  i love log cabin and this place certain remind me of just thatthe lodg is locat on douch boulevard just off of bimbo lane and around the corner from boob job squar 

there are time when ive come here and had a great time play some game with friend wasnt perturb by douchey mcdouchetard and drank some cold beer 

but then

i was here last night and arriv befor my friend the bar area was full so i had to take a seat at a tabl and then wait and wait and come the f on fake boob job waitress i know you see me sit here and just becaus im not a tabl full of dude pretend that my fat is realli muscl i would still like to purchas a damn drink for serious 

i final get my drink order taken and deliv after she flirt some more with the pudgi dude across the way i continu to wait for my friend 

like magic as soon as he arriv she appear almost instantan to take his order whatever

i veri serious doubt i would come back here of my own choic  mayb if i sprout a peni and wore an iron teeshirt or button down plaid shirt stuf with muscl i would but until then ill stay awayi had not been to a grimaldi in about five year prior to this visit i knew that it was a rather pricey pizza restaur but i was crave pizza and we were at san tan mall so i figur i would give it anoth tri i was with my sister and she did have her dog with her so we ask one of the manag if we could sit outsid on the patio with the dog at first she said no but then she told us if we could find a seat near the edg of the rail and tie him up on the outsid of the rail we could eat on the patio we did end up find a perfect spot where we were abl to tie him up and have him right next to us while sit on the patio it was realli nice of her to let us do that and accommod our need with the dog good start

w were pretti hungri last night and we both realli want a starter of some kind garlic bread bruschetta someth like that to our surpris grimaldi carri no form of appet other than salad salad are great and all but we just couldnt believ that they had no other kind of appet when we ask our waitress if they had ani sort of bread she  seem almost irrit that we even ask we decid that we would just end up order a starter caesar salad becaus realli this was one of our onli choic we also order a larg   pepperoni onion and jalapeno pizza the salad was okay the caesar dress was a littl to bitter for me a littl too much vinegar for my tastes

th pizza here for me is just okay some peopl realli love grimaldi and to each their own but it is just not the pizza of choic for me the crust was a littl over done which becaus of the coal brick oven gave it a slight burn tast i did like the fresh mozzarella and that was probabl the best part of the pizza but i found myself eat around other part of the pizza just to get to the bit of chees i am just not a fan of grimaldi pizza and i wont find myself come back here to pay 22 for a pizza i dont like the servic was pretti good our waitress was veri attent i did get a slight sens of arrog from her but overal she kept our drink refil and she did answer our question even if she was a littl snooti about it i did give a three star becaus even though this is not the pizza for me it is not bad pizza just not my tastwhat a nice day today 
i had a busi associ in from san francisco  i alway laugh when i write that becaus it make me sound like toni sopranobusi associ but we arent in wast manag so i guess were ok

daili dose the littl brother of fusion and in someth close to the standard definit of insan i alway get a dd burger there and expect it to be as good as the burger at fusionit never is and yet i tri it again it the old softwar dog in mei am well awar that i can run the exact same program 10 time and the 11th time it will perform differ often better
th servic was good today the weather was terrif and the food was ok not great but certain not bad the altern would have been a burger at fudd and i alway tri to support my local folk if i can
so go on a nice day sit outsid and watch the world go by and dont be like meorder someth other than dd burger and togeth we can break this cycl of mine32 39  416

took mom w me for breakfast twice and then final tri the 2 taco on taco monday  aja brekki and ashley dinner our server are alway delight  theyr both warm and friend and both pretti too and most import they patient listen and retriev the info i need should i requir it  i have to contend w numer food allergi it isnt funni  

breakfast consist of the ham benedict and the rosemari steak and egg  the benedict hollendais sauc was silkysmooth and not too heavi it had a nice mouthfeel to it  the egg that laid beneath the sauc were perfect cook  they were a beauti to behold and even more enchant to bite through  have i mention i like food w good mouthfeel  the slice of ham while veri love to look at were too salti for my tast  mom concur  the dd hash made w caramel butternut squash saute mushroom and caramel onion was good but mom prefer the countri potato and ill have to agre  i realli like perfect cook butternut squash and ala the squash prepar here has consist been hitormiss either not cook enough or too mushi but the countri potato are alway a hit  perfect season and brown everi time  perhap we wouldv enjoy the meal better had we swap out the muffin and hollendais sauc for a biscuit and some sausag gravi dd still serv the best biscuit and gravi ive ever had  it nice to know that this option is alway avail in ani of the benedict dish  

the rosemari steak and egg platter was a disappoint  first we had to send the steak back as it was definit cook to welldon we prefer medium rare to medium but no worri this was quick remedi  ten minut later we were abl to tri our first bite  eh noth special  leftov steak was less flavor moreov  what a wast  egg were a bit scorch on the outsid and too runni insid we ask for overmedium  if i want scorch and runni egg i can cook them myself at home  hehe  actual i make great fri egg  thank good that the toast was delight but in the end who want to walk away know they paid 20 for liter toast and coffe  btw the coffe here is veri weak  we havent order anoth cup sinc the initi attempt and should we tri again well have to see if theyll brew a stronger batch just for us  hey other venu have done so and quit 5star of  them too  so breakfast at dd that week werent too success but well keep go back for the creme brule and bananablueberri pancak tri the gingerbread batter as well as the awesom sausag and biscuit the chunki sausag chipotl cream sauc is todiefor

i cant believ i wait this long to tri the 2 taco special on monday  we tri all four varieti carn asada and one each of the crunchi and grill chicken and chorizo and mom and i like the carn asada the best we order two  i like all but the grill chicken of which i had a bite but mom enjoy it  if you have an avocado allergi be sure to let the staff know and doublecheck your order as well to make sure that the guac is deliv onthesid  the second carn asada arriv w the guac in the taco dd serv up good guac  trust me i suffer through day of pain and lethargi to be abl to say this is true  tri it w ani of the wrap if it doesnt alreadi accompani it

i dont let the issu keep me from a fave activ of mine though as some anonym yelper have suggest  i actual use it to my advantag when dine out as it aid me w find qualiti venu and the staff that help keep consum such as myself come back again and againpleas avoid order an omelett here it look like a styrofoam frisbe that been fold in half stuf with your favorit dice meat andor veggi it tast like styrofoam too becaus i dont think they use real egg egg in a carton fo sho and the omelett are steamedyuck i have visual evid post here for those who doubt me 

other than that they have decent price food the portion are big and you dont leav here still feel hungri i went here twice for lunch and i didnt have to wait in line at all the servic is polit prompt and accomod overal this restaur is a good place to go to eat for conveni if your stay at the palazzo and decent foodi dont know how i get sucker into the grand lux cafe but i do  it a decent vega coffe shop type place but more upscal and expens i get itbut the food is alway just soso to me when i dine here  my most recent visit we ordered

crispi caramel chicken 1650
httpwwwyelpcombizphotosgrandluxcafelasvegas5selectpkbbf5klpx7hag9hyrwapkbbf5klpx7hag9hyrwa

th slider were ok noth special  same for the crispi caramel chicken  neither one blew me away and made me want more

th servic here is alway hit or miss  they get realli busi and the place is huge so it easi for you to get lost  dure this visit i forgot to ask my server for thousand island dress for the slidersit took me a while to find him and flag him down becaus he was serv tabl on the other side of the huge dine room so it wasnt easi for him to glanc over to our tabl to see us wave at him  final anoth server ask what we need and she help us outoye

return factor  60the custom servic was good but the froyo and top just werent impressive

th worst part was that they didnt have mochi top and some of their top were in these horribl dollar store dispens i had to shake the coconut one so hard that it look like a snowstorm blew through there when i final got some out

they do not have mani flavor either onli 10 they say they have 15 becaus they count the mix version as their own separ flavor i dont

they sell at 036ounc and the one employe there was sweet but the froyo just didnt live up to my vega standard for froyo ie yogurtland uswirl etcferrari  fashion  filet  fogo de chao 

mayb it just me but i felt out of place here well i am get up there in age and no longer feel a part of the in crowd as we park our car yes we park our own car and didnt use the valet we saw ferrari merced escalad bmws and they were everywher my husband and i drive a lexus so were not exact chop liver but the car display here was overthetop 

then there the eye candi grant it was az restaur week so the restaur was bustl with high energi there were so mani gorgeous young girl in stiletto and spandex dress that were two size too small im not sure how my husband was abl to concentr on his food 

as for the food it was good the salad bar is huge with exot and high end offer includ tender fresh asparagus stalk appl salad hard salami and prosciutto shave authent parmigiana reggiano sundri tomato and fresh made buffalo mozzarella 

here how the allyoucaneat carnivor feast work after youv had your fill of the salad bar use your special coaster to let the waiter know your readi flip the coaster to green to signal food servic or red to take a break each waiter carri dramat skewer with differ meat there are at least a dozen differ varieti of beef chicken lamb sausag pork onc we flip our coaster to green those waiter swarm on us like fli to honey truth be told it was overwhelm almost scari so we quick flip our coaster back to red so we could enjoy our feast i was surpris that mani of the meat select were dri mayb they could set some flavor dip sauc on the tabl to provid moistur and a varieti of flavor but perhap that would defeat the purpos of showcas the meat 

at ani rate i can see how mani peopl enjoy fogo de chao but for me im not a fanat the airport at 530 am starv sinc i havent eaten in about an hour and with noth els openmi choic are slim there a starbuck open but the line was crazi long so it aunti ann pretzel for break the fast  custom servic was okay but could be better  the line was quick but i was the onli one in it then there the food i got their bacon egg and chees sandwich  the sandwich was small greasi burnt and did not hit the spot  the sandwich look like mcdonald version but nowher close to their tast  sad when mcdonald is the benchmark  good thing i pack some turkey meatbal chicken breast and shake for the flight

i guess i should just stick to what they are known for which is pretzel  not the best choic for meal 2 but it still food  first time ever eat from aunti ann pretzel and was littl disappoint still give them 3 star becaus it basic fast food and you get what you pay forsimpli not the best

    yesterday was about my third time catch the feast buffet at texa station act in feast buffet style the qualiti of the food could be good one visit and behind the eight ball on other on yesterday visit color me unimpress with the qualiti of the food

  i arriv on the cue for feast buffet around 315 pm it was a fair long line that move on the slow side becaus not all station were avail the upsid to the line manag is that when i approach the front there was a regist on both side if youv been to the feast buffet at red rock or green valley ranch you have to get off the line to pay then get back in line while be assert about prevent peopl from the vip line cut into your side this line manag techniqu rais my rate from 2 810 star to 3 the thing is that the buffet wasnt realli worth the wait 

  the admiss for a buffet adventur on sunday is around 1050 for all day brunch in my honest opinion the brunch buffet is a gimmick to rais the price of lunch just like red rock ad some peel shrimp to their saturday buffet and call it the shrimp and rib night to rais the price person at 315 pm in the afternoon i dont want an american food station for exampl to have zero corn niblet in place of scrambl eggs

  both the select and tast were bland the asian food station was lack on chow fun spici eggplant and cabbag for exampl the italian food station was most spaghetti meatbal and filler food and contrari to the major of the feast buffet an ice cream station was nonexist the food was so forgett for exampl the rib was most a sticki bone the temperatur of the coffe was below my expect my favorit part of the meal was the wonton soup i did not have the usual experi that i have at the sunset station buffet where the bowl of wonton soup is all broth and carrots

  what about the servic just like the major of feast buffet there is one overwork server balanc sever tabl worth of dish i did find it discust look at all the use plate at the vacat tabl to my left for a good half hour

   feast buffet at texa station is simpli not the best i know that they will never be the best but they could be a lot better than they were todayi had veri high expect for the breakfast joynt becaus so mani gave it 5 star which mean as good as it get woohoo accord to yelp  my experi didnt live up to that but im will to give them anoth try

thi locat was former a bar that was transform into a breakfast restaur  the actual bar is still there with a flat panel tv in the middl but surpris the shelv are still empti all the way up to the ceil  theyv onli been there around 6 month so mayb this will chang as they settl into the locat  it has a veri clean upscal feel to it  someth not out of place in north scottsdal  it also easi to find onc your off the 101 onto raintre and then north on northsight it on the right and share park with gold gym that is easili seen from the road

i found the egg to be good and recommend steer toward the omelet choic  be from the south it wasnt thrill that the biscuit were somewhat small and squar shape almost like a littl dinner roll  they have their own style and theyv inform me that they are homemad but i was look for someth more substanti to be smother in sausag gravi  the pancak were not serv hot with the other food item and they seem to have settl and were somewhat chewi and elastic

menu was rather straightforward and clear with section box with a nice highlight of their featur stuf appl pancak  i thought the descript of ham that fall off the bone was repeat far too mani times

pric were veri reason for scottsdal  the fresh squeez orang juic was excel  owner are veri concern about custom with less than a stellar dine experi so ill be sure to give the breakfast joynt anoth tri with friend and familiive been here a few time for breakfast and have to say that the food is ok but noth to rave about to the neigbor i usual get the omlet with onion green pepper and ham denver omlet 

lunch is not the greatest either i had the mont cristo last time i was here and it pale in comparison to other mont cristo sandwich i have had local blue32

i would rate the breakfast side about 3 12 star and the lunch side of the busi 2 12 star so the breakfast joynt get an averag score of 3 out of 5 star in my opinioni wasnt hate this as much as the other review but im be relat lenient with a few issu we had due to it be so new

decor i thought the wall and ceil chang everi 20 minut was fun kind of silli but it was a novelti 

food
french crab cocktail just crab meat that had been shell and serv chill with some sauc on the side fresh sweet succul delici 

lobster salad realli tasti and it wasnt just some goopi mayo mess like some other ive seen lot of lobster some avocado a nice light dress delish 

bread cold similar to the bread they serv at bouchon but not as good

risoto it appear anoth review didnt love this as much as i did it was parmesanchampagn flavor and delish 

steak awesom but we had sever prepart issu the peopl who order their medium had awesom perfect cook steak the peopl 3 who order them medium rare all got medium well steak 2 of the 3 ate their as is but when the 3rd diner ask for a differ steak he got some attitud from the waitress im sorri when the steak order medium rare is signific more done than the steak order medium there was a goof somewher they should have replac it no question ask the steak was a dull greybrown in the middl not  a hint of pink hard what id call medium rare

2 diner order their steak rossini style with foie gras tasti of cours but as you can tell from my review im a foie gras freak so unless they overcook it or ruin it im love anyth with foie gras 

we order sweet potato fri but the waitress forgot to bring them she belittl my 18 yo sister and told her oh you forgot to order them umm no the entir tabl heard her order them nice tri though oh well so we didnt get to tri these 

i do think this place has some potenti cool atmospher yummi steak when they prep them correct and some good seafood starter servic realli need to clean up their act though if this was a restaur that had been open for more than 2 week i would have definit give them 2 star a steak restaur shouldnt screw up cook steakdrive down e windmil lane we couldnt ignor the izakaya sign  spectacular review on yelp gave us the final push to check out this restaur weve been so curious about 

weekday even and happi hour has just end 5 pm to 7 pm so were see an interest mix of peopl hang out at the sushi bar

upon seat it hard to ignor the menu becaus there is just so much to go through  there the sushi and sashimi menu the you pick menu that includ side order the regular a la cart menu the dinner combin menu the vegetarian menu and the beverag menus

aft some care perus we decid to go with item from the you pick menu pick 3  1595 pick 4  1995 pick 5  2495  the waiter suggest we do the pick 4 sinc we plan on order other thing as well

 wafu yakiniku tender slice beef with miko special sauc  steam plate of tender and juici piec of beef  pretti good

 shishamo grill roe capelin  four piec of smelt in this order

 sashimi chef choic of slice raw fish  a nice select of raw fish about five larg slices

 oyakodon top with simmer chicken and egg  this dish arriv last  it was a steam bowl of chicken onion and scrambl egg on rice with sauc  we were too full to enjoy this so we pack it for home

 tonkotsu ramen ramen noodl and pork flavor soup  serv with miko gyoza 950  look quit pretti with it hardboil egg fish cake and veget green float on top the soup look pretti authent  howev the tonkatsu wasnt quit what we expect  were use to pork cutlet that been bread and fri and this wasnt the case  there was pork in the soup but not what we know as tonkatsu  mayb they got the order wrong  the gyoza was also a bit differ  it complet deepfri and look more like a flatten eggrol than a gyoza updat  candac c was so nice to point out that tonkotsu ramen is actual a pork bone broth ramen so that was our mistak that we were expect tonkatsu  the deep fri pork cutlet  see how one letter can chang what your expect at least now we know

 agedashi tofu fri tofu in special broth 3  the lone block of tofu was more fri than i hope and there wasnt much of a broth  it was more like a light sauc on the bottom

beyond the food we couldnt help but notic the dynam of the staff  sure it definit seem like it was bit understaf as the owner husband was the waiter and busboy for the even  we also notic one lone sushi chef and a prep cook behind the sushi bar  the latter two were not the most profession use languag like asshol etc from behind the sushi bar and holler up to the front  i also found it weird that the girl who was hang out at the sushi bar when we arriv eventu went behind the sushi bar to help out  mayb she work there  her purs and phone were still by her seat

servic was a bit slack onli becaus miko husband was respons for front of the hous and he was alon  we did have to ask for plate refil etc  he did bring us complimentari miso soup though befor our meal which was a nice touch  befor we left though he chat with us a bit and told us more about his wife restaur  have open in septemb of 2008 they were do quit well  then with the struggl economi they have sinc expand their menu to accommod more diner and their various like a 65 year old japanes chef oversea the kitchen and the recip are authent japanes one  howev with the younger staff up front they do maintain a differ imag for the younger crowd and domin this restaur and has pretti much taken over the sushi bar

im torn i want to like this place for what it stand for and where it came from  but i was turn off by the antic of the kitchen staff  when im look for more authent japanes home cook food this place would be a good consider  i think they need to work on get the food out at the proper time tooas we were walk toward the front desk we see a sign that say happi hour  2 for 1 mojito at the societi cafe heck yeah the friend and i decid to go get some mojito and sangria after we check in 

societi cafe is a classi bar but the bar area was quit small happi hour menu consist of 2 for 1 mojito and sangria as well as americanstyl tapa about 5 each dish

i order their strawberri mojito it was yummi i like how they use real fresh strawberries

i also order three tapa 3 for 14 mac  chees w truffl dip sauc pig in blanket and buffalo wing 

the mac  chees was uniqu u get six small littl bites
pig in blanket was not that great the pig were hard and wrink and dri 
buffalo wing was alright noth special

al in all the food was thumb down the drink were thumb up 
the food wasnt that worth it 

id come back here for drink onlimy milkshak bring all the boy to the yard 

mmmmm yes they do make a great shake the glass is rim with the most sweetest and thick caramel one could imagin realli add a nice tast blend with a vanilla shake when you scrape the side of the glass with your spoon can you say mouth orgasm

i use to dine here a lot with my boyfriend chris as he live around the corner from snap we ate here sever time a month for close to a year and a half so we have tri mani meal here we still talk about our old snap day lolol yes serious the restaur is call snaps

servic is hit and miss sometim we are ignor and sometim they are up my ass with servic me 

the food qualiti is good and so are the portion 

i realli like have breakfast here i think that is realli their specialty
c go wrong with denver omelet pancak french toast and their signatur skillet make sure you are hungri 

i have also tri from the chines menu and they make a great sweet and sour shrimp huge shrimp mmmmm 

they have a great sourdough burger in which i believ they now call the frisco burger mmmmm tri it you will see what i am excit about i have to cut this burger down with a knife everi time just to fit it all in my mouth to eat thick butteri fri sourdough bread bacon guacamol doubl chees 14 angus patti lettuc tomato purpl onion and fri onion string mmmmmm is soooooo good 

price are reason howev are slowli increas late and the restaur is veri comfort with booth and tabl 

snap is locat insid of the eastsid cannery

tri itif i was yelp 3 year ago id be the duke by a long shot  when i first move to las vega in 2011 south point was my home for the first coupl of month  so that meant a lot of breakfast lunch and dinner at the coronado cafe  now that doesnt mean that the coronado cafe is a must stop  it just mean that i was too lazi to leav the casino when the belli was call  

so here my review

servic  this realli depend on the day the time and how busi they are  ive gotten servic as bad as 2 star and as good as 5 star  iron the servic is actual better dure the weekend night when they are busi  busi here also mean a lot more employe work which mean pretti good servic i found longer wait dure the quiet morningafternoon 

the food  there someth for everyon here the menu is extens and there even chines food  

mi suggest  
egg  no one mess up egg coronado doesnt either
clam chowder  pretti good stuff  not new england or morro bay good but good enough that youll be want more
porterhous for 1299  bang for your buck  this is somewhat dri so if your use to a mediumwel get a medium plus  
sweet  sour chicken  surpris not too bad  
asparagus  not on the menu but theyll make it if you request it  good stuff
salmon  ive had good and bad salmon here  but ive had more good than bad  noth realli special  tast wise it okay protein wise it worth it 
chicken parmesan  just okay but worth the tri if your in the mood  

take my advic avoid these
gril halibut steak  flaki just how i like my fish but it too dri and realli fishi 
prime rib  tast like cardboard 
ani of their salad  ive never had a fresh one here


overal i have to say that the food is just averag at best  howev coronado fit everyon budget  the food is inexpens and if your in the casino the restaur is conveni 



yelp person challeng 2013  495500this place is probabl the best cheap er sushi ive had in vega servic is slow i mean slow it will take you a while to eat here so open up some time and go with a friend you havent seen in a while that you like obvious it easi to have awkward silenc here wonder where that roll you order an hour ago has gone  

in my stomach 
surf and turf  albacor tuna cover in medium rare kobe beef mmm
birthday roll  yum
spid roll  no lame without flavor
beef teriyaki  not badgener beef avail everywherebut it good if your not into sushi
staci roll  came with the combo beef super good 

they have mochi ice cream which i love but they onli give you one which isnt standard anywher els but they had red bean which made my mom happi not a date place to make a good impress  this is like  you have to take someon out becaus of some stupid meet or mayb you just need someth decent with friendi can onli give my opinion of their month wednesday late night menu so take this for what it is ive not been here for lunch or dinner

excit to find out about their uber secret month late night ramen gather five or six of us decid to make an even of it start out with one of their gin cocktail was a delici decis and i sip on it while share a coupl of item from the menu i like cabbag and was excit to tri out the okonomiyaki a grill top  cook pancak of cabbag a few other add in top with super tasti sauc bacon and a few other item san the shrimp caus of an allergi it is worth order again we share an order a the goma ramen pretti tasti similar to other ramen but notabl better unfortun there were a few hangup with the order some holier than thou servic from the waiter that even and issu refil drinks

aft the meal i chat with the chef for a minut or two he told me they were think about do their ramen menu dure lunch soon but i havent seen it happen just yet overal the experi was fun but that was most from get to watch the chef cook and hang with our friends

happi yelp phoenixholi mole i just got suck into an unbeliev vortex of senior citizen mental note never go here on a weekend again possibl never  yike  i am still shaken up   
okay so i am drive back from purchas my cow yes i said cow  actual a quarter cowanyhoo drive back down grand ave  and what do you know a big beauti trader right in the middl of nowher 

i think aaaha now i dont have to stop at the arrowhead onesweet 
but from the moment i got there there were these old peopl everywher walk in the middl of the road block the cart in the aisl complet stand there like a deer in the headlight ug
 i know that they need thing too  and i am so glad for their sweet old bodi to get some healthi stuff but for the love of pete move over 
let a gal thru and doe it realli take five of you to stand in front of the shelf to find one jar of pesto

i am sure trader joe had mani love yummi item but i couldnt find them i liter gave up grab some  green onion  waffl  and some yogurt for hubbi and boogi out of there 

consid yourself warnwhen i first move to edinburgh and was hunt out a brunch spot toast came up trump time and time again and my egg benni last time wasnt bad as neither was my salmon bagel

mi last breakfast here  pancak with bacon and mapl syrup  was aok two veri thick fat pancak two bit of bacon and the syrup the pancak were so thick and doughi they werent quit how i like my pancak i make american one at home dont get me wrong i like em big but these werent fluffi they were veri veri heavi also the ratio of bacon to pancak wasnt great probabl due to the enorm size of the beastin pancakes

it also veri cramp insid with tabl close to one anoth hard ani maneouv room between tabl and at the tabl i had my friend had her back near the entranc where peopl were often push by and the cold air kept creep in on her

i do quit like the neighbourhood local feel of toast some of the brunch item are great it remind me of the sort of place my grandma use to take me when i was a wee girl in a good way but i wouldnt say it my favourit brunch spot in town and next time ill avoid the pancakno warmfuzzi for this place  when i call to place my order the woman on the phone seem genuin annoy that she had to answer my question and that i didnt seem to know enough about her product  sinc sell cake isnt actual my job i figur shed be abl to help me but whatev  sinc i had a groupon i place my order anyway  when i arriv to get my cake the cashier seem somewhat confus about everyth  

on the plus side the cake is freakin fantast  it is worth 5 star for sure im a bundt cake lover but to spare myself the annoy servic ill probabl just bake my own next timeover the past few month we have been on a search for the best red velvet cupcak or someth similar to a cupcak in town sad we did not find it at noth bundt cake dont get me wrong it was okay but it didnt even come close to the qualiti and tast that we experienc with tammi coe red velvet cupcak i think we got spoil by have her cupcak first becaus all of the other variat have fail to impress us as much if at all there were two major problem with the bundt that we tri here first it was too heavi mayb that just the natur of the bundt itself but we found it to be way too heavi and rich which onli allow us to eat about half of the thing two it didnt have a lot of flavor i know that might sound contradictori to my last statement about it be rich but just becaus someth is rich and heavi doesnt automat mean that it has a lot of flavor which this dessert clear didnt have it was miss that wow factor that melt in your mouth so good you want anoth one type of feel that we get with tc cupcak im glad we tri it onc so that we can scratch it off our list of place to tri but i realli doubt that we will be go back for ani more bundt oh well on to the next place 

ps ani suggest for a place to tri red velvet cupcak or bundtsar welcomso in the cours of my various wheel and deal in phoenix i have driven past this empti build sever time i final saw it lit up and renam bantu bistro west african cuisin wow i final got a group togeth to tri this new littl place when i arriv i saw that my group was situat in the middl of the restaur i had made a reserv and the staff was kind enough to make a long row of tabl for us to sit at 

i was greet by a friend servic staff we had two server for our larg group i ask for a menu of beer and the staff seem a littl shaki on what was and was not avail it seem that they had various bottl of differ beer they also had white and red wineboth were refriger i went with a beerani beer 

for my meal i went with a coconut stew with chicken in it i chose fufu think grit and potato for my two side while wait for our meal we were brought out plantain with a chili dip sauc they were well cook and the sweet compliment the semispici sauc well after a bit of a wait our meal were serv it was a bit chaotic tri to figur out who order what but everyth got work out my stew was not so much a stew as it was a light thin soup the flavor were not robust and hearti but were light and refresh not quit what i want that night but it wasnt poor made the fufu and the potato had no season on it the purpos of the side are to add to your stew and let the main dish flavor your side 

dure the meal the ownerchef made sever visit to our tabl he even brought us some bean to compliment our meal he seem veri open to suggest and comment made by our group the onli thing i would chang about bantu are have a good beer select have a coupl wine by the glass avail and do not refriger your red wine have a staff that is knowledg about the dish and can make good suggest offer a week special that is not on the menu

now onto the servic i wasnt impress with the servic it as if we were forgotten about onc she set down the food i dont recal her return until she drop the check off which luckili for her i didnt mind it becaus i was have a good convers with my mother in law and enjoy be out fyi i use to be a server i know what good and bad servic is she wasnt that great so between her the hostess and the ok food im give this place 3 star i truli enjoy my time here though onli becaus of the great compani and mimosaugh im done i said as i wipe away my tear ive had enough of a certain friend of mine who had talk shit to me for the last time my sister feel my pain suggest that we go where everi sadden indian girl goe when feel bad the nearest indian casino whoo well okay mayb not the nearest indian casino but the one across the freeway and down the road the brand spankin new lone butt casino 

when we go into the nuevo rich diner i was surpris by how shini it all was there were deli case show off dessert that look meh and these pedest that showcas modern nativ art but it didnt mesh well with the decor of the place the dine room was big and the tabl were veri well space apart

w were escort to our tabl sat down and look over the menu tri to decid the best way to cap off the night the menu contain all american favorit in all their greasi good think of the late night denni menu but san the moon over my hammi and youll be dead on were told that alan or alec was our waiter and would be by soon to take our drink order so we wait and wait and wait and wait the last time i wait this long for a friggin drink order it was becaus the bar was be danc on by stripper wannab get their coyot sure ugli on  yeah ill wait for the clearheel one to vacat the bar sure whi not but this was not the case at cafe 247 

not want to wait around in this crazi color chang world oh yeah  did i tell you about the color omg these damn light in the ceil keep chang like from green to yellow to blue to pink to clear and back again it not even a gradual chang either it a sudden chang and the moment my eye get use to the new hue the color chang again it was distract and annoy especi when look at the huge multiscreen tv behind the deli case that for some reason was set to channel 12 and display everyth in green 

but anyway i digress i got up and went to the deli case and told two employe that we have been wait for a veri long time i learn that the staff is veri good at apolog and the hostess took over our tabl we order and got our food veri fast okay now the food

our sampler appet that came with potato skin chicken tender onion ring and mozzarella stick were good and light and crunchi and crispi and noth was over done or soggi i was happi and surpris i dont know whi but i alway expect casino food to be bad food the next round was our entre i order the angus burger with chees and bacon and this half pound bad boy had too much bacon on it i share with the sis who was happi to receiv it to go on her turkey sandwich more on that in a second my burger was cook well and was fresh as was the top and bun i was delight but i wasnt happi with have to pay extra for french fri serious  it should just come with it at the other gila river casino fri come with everyth boo on café 247 on this faux pas my sister turkey sandwich was awesom it was pile high with nice real turkey lol like someon took a knife to the bird minut befor it hit our tabl no prepackag water log sodium fill meat product here 

we ate and i tri to laugh and get my mind off of the night drama when we were approach by the café manag he inform us that the café is actual own by the same compani that is associ with chase stadium and not the casino usual food and beverag depart he also slight chuckl when i tri to serious complain about the long wait at the begin of our meal sigh just like a man huh oh well

to my yelper all in all  if your on that side of town and it late like realli late and your over 21 and the thought of go to denni by the freeway seem too disgust for word feel free to go to café 247 the food option are the same but it done so much better the servic might be shit like our was but get up and to go the deli complain and you should be alright i say go but dont go out of your way to go oh and leav your rosecolor glass at home cuz the color chang throughout your meal might make your eye bleed ill give it one more tri befor i die but just oneafter yet anoth night of insan vega parti  and enjoy alcohol aflowin  we got the munchi where did we decid to go when it late and you want someth cheap and easi insert favorit joke here veri littl top fast food

w drove to a random mcdonald with a kfc next door  fyi there are a lot of them between the strip and red rock our hotel at the drivethru we place an order for larg fri and 20 chicken mcnuggets

when we went to get our food we were told they were out of larg fri  how doe that happen  and were given hash brown as a substitut sinc it was between three and four in the morn we didnt press the issue

anyway the mcnugget were pipe hot fed us and i have no idea what happen to those hash brown what happen in vega stay in vega rightthis is the 2nd closest mcds to my hous the closest one is so inconsist that i come to this one more often the drive thru can be long  and they often run out of cinnamon melt but the food is at least the way i order it and hot when i get it the insid is clean and a mad hous dure breakfast time all in all a decent locatafter a quick meet with one of my attorney i swung by the aj here for lunch with my buddi brian s yesterday you know it just beyond wrong that it take more than one attorney to surviv these dayssadly

at ani rate while the lunch at the grill was as good and cheap as it alway is that grill salmon sandwich keep me come back when i went to get a cup cake for my treat after lunch i was dumbfound by the price aj is charg for these thing now

499 for one cup cake

seri eddi are you tri to fuel the jet by sell ridicul price bake goodi to the gullibleyour in bkyou might want to think that kind of price through

at ani rate brian suggest yogurtology

i have not had the best of luck with fill your own cup yogurt place in the past but im a sucker for ani place with olog in the name make it sound scientif and reasonable

w walk in and i thought i was in trouble45 an ounc for their yogurtit would need to be pretti damn good yogurt for me to be happi pay those pricesluckili it was discount day35 an ounceso far so good

then it turn out that brian had a coupon so even better

yogurtolog had a pretti good select of flavor includ vanilla the bentley of ice cream flavor and by default the onli flavor for me when it come to frozen yogurt

btw we call it ice cream even ice milk so whi do we call it frozen yogurtit lead to that unfortun alliter froyoalthough i can see problem with ice yogurtdoesnt sound appet doe it 

it was pretti decent for yogurt although my heart doe inde belong to ice cream and gelato

i cant and wont complain about yogurtologyw had 2 good size cup of yogurt with top out the door for about 350 and my lunch was save from the predatori cup cake price practic of ajs

if i was ever go to get more frozen yogurt and i was within 100 yard of yogurtolog i would definit returnunless somebodi open a gelato shop nearbii am alway on the lookout for a new bbq place and i found this one at n durango  farm just around the corner from mountain ridg skatepark

their claim to fame is vegasstyl bbq look at the menu everyth is veri reason price and they have beefporkchicken  link plus burger and all the standard bbq side and red skin potato salad

it a real small place next to dq and it has 6 small tabl is paint purpl and has a flat screen on the wall to watch while you wait  you will wait

wel i tie the beef brisketpul pork  hot link sandwich plus mac n cheesecoleslaw  red skin potato salad

599for a sandwich  1 sidewhat a deal

al the sandwich come cover in chees onion and sweet bbq sauc that vegasstyle

they smoke their meat so it was real tasti i dont get whi they smother it in a sweet bbq sauc the pork sandwich was the best with coleslaw on it and the bbq sauc mix real well

th link  brisket were good but id rather skip the vegasstuff mac n chees was weak potato sald was alittl runni but the colslaw was quit a supris real good

thi place has good price  good meatjust know how to order it without sauc  it a winnerjust anoth new breakfast  lunch spot in the vega valley of cours it close to my old condo so i had to give it a tri 

ate there twice for breakfast while i was make the move  place was hoppin  it in an industri park area  most of the custom were worker in the area  

decent 295 breakfast  the usual 2 egg potato toast baconsausageham also tri their version of the grand slam  cost 595 

if in the area and need a quick bite at reason price i recommend go out of your way for a special breakfastlunch  not the place 

happi eat so i might have been slight wrong about pita jungl becaus of the butterfli effect right after the ink on my pj review dri my buddi wife want their takeout and sinc i hadnt been for a while i thought it was onli fair to the yelp god that i check my assess verac 

mi decis to get the jalapeno and cilantro hummus was heavili influenc by my spritualculinari guid richard z hes usual right about two thing my neurot behavior that lead me to straight to crestfallon lace intern disharmoni and food 

it was tasti inde and spici enough to make me smile 

but here whi im bump up the stars

our server said the funniest shit

mi friend ask 

how the tuna melt pizza

awesom server 

it smell terrible

friend 

like farts

a 

like vagina answer phone

 take order put phone down

wel not like my vagina 

dalla and friend

 stare blankly

thre starso ive been on a low carb lifestyl as of the first of the year so option arent all that plenti when visit my friend out in the burb fortun the wing at bww are fri and not bread so for about 3 carb for everi six less the sauc you can have a pretti good and satisfi meal the garlic parmesan 2 carb per oz of sauc wing are pretti good with a side of ranch and some celeri perfect 

the servic was realli friend but for a bar type place the dine room was pack with kid not that i cant stand kid just that with all the beer serv it just doesnt seem like a famili kind of place talk about a bad exampl do you realli want your kid hang out in a bar

im just glad that there are more low carb option out this way though leav the kid at home or take them to oliv gardeni dont get the allur 
is it the furnitur 
the water pitcher 

when i go out to eat i want food that tast great it whi i have decid not to cook and actual leav my abod to go spend money somewher els and the food ive had just doesnt wow me now ive onli been for breakfast so mayb thing realli get excit around lunchtim add to this the fact that server are a bit aloof i find myself have to repeat ask for thing and the insan price for egg i get the whole true food thing i do and it just not a place ill find myself return to soonif i could sum up la brioch in one word it would be overr 

ive been to la brioch more time than ive like becaus i have an aunt in town who love it and we go togeth often also i use to work at the uwhc and would go to lunch with cowork there sometimes

i like that la brioch is attract their decor style is cute and remind me of an eccentr old ladi hous the hot pink wallpap on the back wall is the bomb i also like how the egg dish come with mix green on the side instead of carb 

here is what i dont like about la brioch 

it expens last time i was there a coupl month ago i took a new employe out for lunch we both drank water and order a sandwich each the sandwich come with green salad on the side my sandwich a blt in particular was tini it was more like the size of a halfsandwich from a place like panera the bill came to someth like 30 dollar with tip i thought this was ridicul and i didnt think the servic food or atmospher warrant that price

th egg are bland at least the time that ive had omelet and such there the dish contain littl flavor and were in desper need of some salt im also pretti sure base on flavor or lack thereof that they use nonstick spray to cook egg as oppos to use butter this is a cardin sin in my book butter is not to be fear but embraced

th servic is friend but sloooow the aforement lunch with my depart new employe took over an hour from the time we order to the time we got our bill for two sandwich noth even had to be cook this is not good if they hope to appeal to peopl on limitedtim lunch breaks

fin and this is picki ill admit but it realli rub me the wrong way that they have sign up on the wall and a note in the menu  that prohibit the use of laptop and cell phone i get that they want the place to retain an eleg vibe but at the same time it irk me as a function adult to be told what i should do especi in such a passiveaggress manner also la brioch if your go to take over an hour to bring peopl their bill from lunch dure a workday they will probabl have to check their email at some point to avoid get fire and thus be unemploy and unabl to eat at your expens restaurant

overal i guess id give la brioch 3 star but that be extrem charitable
whil  ive never had an appal experi here ive never been wow and ive definit been annoy on sever occasions

th breakdown
tast of food 25 stars
loc 3 stars
servic 3 stars
valu 2 stari cant resist a new thai restaur that come across my path thus i had to tri the new thai orchid garden that recent open a few door down from my favorit salon bella roug 

two other friend and i went to thai orchid for dinner a few night ago they were alreadi seat when i arriv i park and approach the door and an older gentleman was sit out front smoke a cigarett which immedi turn me off he start talk to me greet me and open the door to the restaur ahh  he work there

turn out he more than work there  he was the owner he walk past our booth and sat down in the booth behind us the smell of cigarett smoke was overwhelm 

after a while the odor dissip and our waitress took our order i had my old standbi phanang curri with beef cara had the pad thai and jenni had some kind of chicken and eggplant dish 

mi dish was wonder we all devour our meal and enjoy each other compani the onli time i felt less than thrill was onc when i ask the waitress for more rice  she look at me like i was crazi but then brought more rice  and when the owner came back over to our tabl and start pass out his busi card we were in the middl of a convers and he had interrupt  it was just weird 

will i go back yep the food was good but more like ill place an order to go when im over at bella roug and then enjoy my phanang at homeit get veri pack for game and friday happi hour

blu 32 is a good sport bar lot and lot of tvs clean nice decor the women restroom is luxuri as far as restroom in sport bar are concern  the servic is just okay

ov christma they had these specialti drink made with all the rich decad liquor  one of them was a martini with graham cracker crust on the rim of the glass  i had two of those holiday spirit sooo goodhow could i pass this up free grand slam breakfast to anyon show up from 6am2pm

thi is vega so anytim there free food to be found peopl crawl out from under their rock and show up

know this i went earli at 6am to this locat across from the colleg of southern nevada in the walmart shop center

when i arriv it was fair busi but no line or wait

servic was fast  friend they were veri excit about the big promotion

w order coffe  waterw both got scrambl eggs2 bacon2sausag linkss and 2 pancakes

they food was pretti good fresh and hot but still just fast food i like my bacon crispier and i like hashbrown instead of pancak but what they hell it freeright

th servic was realli good so we tip 5 and spent 5 on coffe for 2 peopl not bad 

bi the time we ate  paid there was a line out the door and past the first 3 store in the shop center i drove by again around noon and the line was still out the door

i did not let that deter meread my other reviewmayb if i write a review like dalla g ill get rotd  here goes

who am i but a slave to the forc of natur  as a slave am i free to pass judgment on those slave toil asid me dawn till dusk at which point i go and fornic with whomev may be will  no i am not and as this commonest of men will tell you no one should ever cast such nobl servant of the world order to the depth of a poor yelp review

so i say five star to ani old establish that can churn out even the most mediocr of food  qdoba is just such a place  good peopl with good intent make decent food for other ant in the giant ant farm we call life  go there enjoy yourself bask in the glori of it all

but i am not dalla g nor would i want to be becaus he is vegan and that make life inordin difficult  it also mean that his burrito had probabl 900 calori fewer than my burrito which was essenti the same except with two cup of queso sauc and a bunch of steak

of cours with queso and steak mean that there will be at least a modicum of tast and that is truebut i say that the food is averag there and onli deserv of three star becaus i dont know if it was the salsa or what but there was a strang flavor that permeat the entir burrito not a bad flavor but not a good flavorit almost was like eat two pound of roast tomatillo in a burrito

fin i begrudg them for have water that came straight from the bottom of an overlychlorin pool  qdoba is decent worth a meal onc or twice a month max  but order a real drinkwhoa a good plate lunch place in the desert 

it not exact hawaii plate lunch but noth wrong with some reinterpret for mainland tast mash potato as an option instead of rice or chicken katsu with brown gravi huh

th teri steak teri chicken and kalbi are just as good as ani back home  all are deepli marin light char cook well done and serv messi over rice and mac salad win  the portugues bean soup and oxtail soup are also both good but cant top the best back home  

the plate are larg 

price are extrem high  at around 10 per plate it even more expens than most hawaii plate lunch restaur  unfortun sinc you can get so much more for your money elsewher off the stripwent here the other day i had the gyoza that was awesom and i am so in love with the sweet and spici sauc that come with it i also had the pork tariyaki that was veri similar to chines barbqu pork it was veri tasti and came in a huge portion but the meat tast like it was one day away from be rotten ugh my mom had the teriyaki chicken and it look so fresh and good but she said it was bland i didnt tast it so im go to have to take her word on it other than that it was a great meal im a fan of their gyoza and am consid give their sushi a tri i say if your on that side of town  give it a go you just may like it i chose 3 star bc it depend what you are look for 
i see it as barcelona north boob and botox everywher 

it get incred crowd  which of cours is great busi  but  it get sooooo hot so loud so crowd 

again  depend what you are look for i guess i am total over the super crowd scottsdal bar scene 

they do have great happi hour deal but  their food  i swear they just go to safeway to pick up some thing we order a chees plate on a coupl differ visit  we had chees cube those littl chees wheel with the wax you peal off the cracker were definit straight out of a groceri bag get this though  we ask for extra cracker to go with our chees cube and chees wheel  and they charg us 

definit go for the scene and the fanci martini if that is your thing 

but  the best deal of all  they have these vip card the vip card allow you a free martini anytim you go as long as it is befor 9pm  and even better  if there is a line to get in and  or a cover  ladi  you and 3 girl get to skip the line and the cover now that is a good deal 

so i guess the 3 star are for me  onc again  i am sure it is 4 or 5 for some peopl and 1 or 2 for other 

have fun

p  park suck  unl you are cool with valet  otherwis  prepar to walk
ps2  melissa was an awesom waitressso ive been here twice  it definit an older crowd well older than me anyway and im in my midtwenti  that not a bad thing just an observ  i met a woman who told me that if she was my age again she would not be hang out at blue martini  anoth guy ask me if i was twelv so you can see whi i bring up the whole age thing  on a side note i was bare buzz so i dont think i was act twelv  

anoth thing i observ three woman not girl danc on a counter and pose seduct for photo  they took at least fifteen shot of just their butt  they were some classi bitch 

what els three peopl confus my male friend for a femal  yeah he realli need to cut his hair he is just too darn pretti  serious his hair could star in a vidal sassoon commerci  he even score a ladi vip card  good times

th night was cap by wit the saddest drunk i have ever seen  i thought that mayb i had accident teleport to vega or rocki point but no i was still in a park lot in az  he had his pant around his ankl a bloodi knee and dirt all over his face  i guess he fell down a few time  he couldnt get his pant up to save his life serious i actual tri to help him i felt so bad  he kept mumbl someth about medic school  ah the children of tomorrow  anyway someon final claim him  

what els  the waitress all wear bustier  i onc went on a thursday night and they had a live band  the blue martini had a glow stick in it  the bathroom are pretti nice  peopl will step on you on the danc floor  i think one guy serious shove me out of the way so he could spin his girl  he was a prick but i iet it slide he was shorter than memy douchebag detector was off the chart from the moment we got insid lot of fake peopl and asian hooker it is one of the few place this far north that offer live music and danc tho if your into that i think i would have enjoy this more dure the week when it isnt as pack and they dont charg guy a cover  i hear they let peopl sing with the band on monday  live karaok anyonive been here mani time with my girlfriend for happi hour and drink  im not sure if they still have them but i got a free ladi vip card that give you 1 free drink everi time you come  i would alway get a dirti martini extra dirti  it was quit larg but after your free one they are expens  the food on happi hour is great and pretti cheap  
ive also been here late at night for a birthday parti and had a lot of fun  the band was great and fun to danc to but the drink were veri expens  it a great place to peopl watch for most peopl get veri dress up to mingl     id come back here for some happi hour specialthe kitchen is basic dish 2 if you dont rememb dish was the place to get your gourmet prepar food which you can either eat there or take home and heat up yourself there was also a full servic restaur if you didnt feel like shop at each of the food station sinc the kitchen is in the old dish space it pretti much the same concept you go to each station pizza salad sandwich roast and fresh prep food order your food then go to the next station they give you a card that each station scan which add to your order then you take your stuff and your card to the check out and your on you merri way  they are also a market that not onli stock simpli bread bake good and bread but also various pasta sauc oliv oil wine and straus organ milk

aft a tour of the place self guid we decid to order a pizza a coupl of sandwich and a salad to go sinc waiter servic in the wine bar doesnt start until 4pm daili after we got order all of our food and got to the car the italian meat pizza 13 99 smell so good we couldnt wait so we share a piec man i burnt the shit out of my tongu but was worth it the pizza was tasti with a slight crisp and chewi crust everyth els we tri when we got home

th food was pretti good while the pizza was the star the rest was just alright jambon sandwich 599 was on a nice chewi baguett and had a nice cover of fresh butter and ham though need a nice glass of red to go with it the the napa valley sandwich 799 was good but would have prefer a differ bread sinc the sourdough it was serv on was kind of bore 

total disappoint includ the arugula with oliv tapenad vinaigrett salad 699 which was pretti bore and the crostini that came with it could have broken a tooth southwestern cou cous 699lb had way to much cumin and hit the trash after onli a few bites

with onli a few let down i think that the kitchen is a much better present than dish and will hope last longer on our visit the place was do veri well with short line at each station next time we go i think i found the best bargain in the hous a whole rotisseri chicken with 3 side 1899 

so whether your low carbin or eat regular food i think that the kitchen will have someth for everyonlet me make this clear that i am awar the owner are go to read this and they know who i am and what i do i am in no way go to let this fact influenc my review 

i came in for lunch with my dad and unfortun for the restaur we were the onli one in it almost for the better as dad had a lot of question about where the ingredi came from and we had the full attent of nick and the bartend the space is clean and has some local art on most of the wall one wall though need to be decor it veri empti the restroom are outsid the restaur which is onli a minor inconvience

i order the gnocchi and it was good but i have been veri much spoil by marcellino gnocchi so i didnt truli think it was phenomon the portion at this restaur are also crazi small i honest dont think ive had such a small meal at a restaur as long as i can rememb i understand about ingredi price profit margin etc but id rather the price be a coupl dollar higher and get a larger meal 

the overal experi was veri posit but id not be yearn to go back immedi ill save it for a somewhat special occas i think everyon would be happi to at least tri it onc thoughid give this place 35 star after read the other review i expect a half of a cup of pasta or someth ridicul but i thought the portion was adequ and i was realli hungri when i got there 

we order the oliv as a starter they are all green and serv warm and were abl to get some bread to accompani the reserv oil 

our server voluntarili explain menu item with import detail like it ricotta gnocchi not potato and the extra item in the puntanesca sauc my recip onli has 7 we both had the orecchiett with sausag and green i found it to be a bit oili but the pasta was cook well 

he describ the desert perfect and the chocol bark with almond was a nice finish with a second glass of nero davalo and by the way i though the wine price were veri reason 

without tip we spent about 36 a person and we each had two glass of wine and left satisfii dont quit get pastabar

thi place is 1000 right in my wheelhous passion about one thing focus on get that complet right focus on qualiti ingredi id heard posit recommend by mani friend and colleagu i respect i was expect to love it how could i not

i dont know mayb my expect were way out of whack they had been knock down a bit that same night by 3 or 4 friend that had been there  i was in the area and itch to go even though id heard multipl comment that it was kind of meh

wel we end up go later in the night

first of all i get the space it cool has charact no problem there  

servic was great as well no issu at all

no problem with the price or portion in fact i thought it was quit reasonable

i first tri the buffalo mozzarella basil pesto heirloom tomato it was nice i dug it would have happili eaten more no firework though and mayb im unfair for expect them

then i tri the two entre i most want both had gotten rave review in a recent articl  i order the chitarra alla carbonara guancialebacon farm egg local onion pecorino and i tri the orecchiett con salsiccia homemad sausag green pecorino

now over the past coupl of year ive realli develop an appreci for peopl do simpl or standard thing realli realli well that was what i was expect here 

the food was definit good but with all the pub that it gotten it definit didnt knock me off my chair  

and the thing is that ive recent been repeat knock off my chair by other spot do standard simpl homemad pasta with killer killer ingredi have been hit total out of left field and couldnt believ how amaz a pappardell with homemad sausag was or a linguin with clams

im guess that mayb my expect were out of whack but i left appreci the meal but sadden that i felt no hurri to rush backanoth 24hour joint i frequent off the strip in the suncoast hotel and casino  i end up dine here befor or after check out the band that play in the suncoast showroom  

this café has decent chines food for late night eat and their breakfast menu is pretti extens  i rememb the cheap graveyard specials2 buttermilk pancakes2 eggsand bacon for 399  they were actual cheaper than that back in the day  

three solid star across the board for most of the dish ive had in the past year 
hous salad
club sandwich
fri rice
beef broccoli
wonton noodl soup 
steak and egg special
prim rib special

th daili special end around 10 pm and the graveyard special were onli offer dure the weekday from 11 pm to 7am  i use to go here more often when they offer a midnight burger special for 3 includ fri and a drink  for that price the burger was except  

servic has been good for me late  for the past coupl of visit i didnt have to wait for a tabl as long as i did beforewhen that burger special was popular  i guess more peopl opt to dine earlier at the new tgif at the other end of the casino2013 halohalo challeng  

both terri r and i complet the vega 100 yelp challeng  new challengewho has the best halohalo in the valley  elena was our first restaur to visit  first impress wasnt good sinc we were immedi told upon walk in that we couldnt stay long becaus they close in 30 minut  then there the actual main attract their halohalo  decent price this dessert was miss red bean and flan  i was alreadi disappoint from that alon  i finish my halohalo and it was just okay ive never been a huge fan of elena pinoy food and their halohalo was no differ  

ps  refer to terri rs review of elena for more detail on their halohalo  httpwwwyelpcombizelenasrestaurantlasvegas2hrid66ptyqvzudrthxlgl74qwi came here for breakfast and have been want to come here for a while  it a bit of a drive for me but i final decid it was time to go

overal i had a good experi and enjoy my time here  it a fast casual type restur where you walk in place your order at the counter and they walk the food out to you  they seem to have a nice select of food most breakfast with some lunch item  

i went for breakfast and want to keep it simpl  i order two egg over medium with toast and potato  i found the toast to be a bit dri and a bit to dark for me  usual i like my toast a littl lighter with butter on it but that was not the case  also i found the potato to be a bit bland and boring

i will probabl be back but was not blown away by this place  i rate it high becuas i think overal it a good place and the food isnt that half badthis was the breakfast club  uye 2nd meet up and this time scrambl was pick for the place it was at 10am on a sunday one thing i can say is that peopl must love scrambl becaus it was busi from the time we got their to the time we left


a sometim i do i did a littl research on the menu and i knew exact what i want to tri the santa fe egg benedict egg poach lie on top of cure ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotl hollandais sauc cover the dish i also switch out the rosemari potato for the sweet potato hash visual this dish look freak fantast howev everyth was lack in flavor and my poach egg i think came from a mini hen bare ani egg white and small yoke  the ham was good had great flavor i had high hope for the jalapeno corn bread tast bud were expect to be hit with bit of jalapeno sad that didnt happen just seem like dri corn bread oh and the hollandais sauc have i told yall how much i love hollandais sauc oh high hope for the sauc too becaus cilantro it has it own uniqu tast and smell and i just love the stuff i love how it can go from a spici dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was alreadi perfect but the hollandais sauc didnt have the hint of cilantro and the sauc itself was lack flavor so i will continu my search for the great hollandais sauc in the valley  the sweet potato hash ok i had no idea what to expect on this it was bland like it need some salt and pepper but it was fresh it had mushroom zucchini and onion sauté  mix in with  slice of sweet potato never thought of do a sweet potato like that now i know go to have to tri it at home 

i order the cinnamon roll too just to tri it again visual great but the roll was dri and hard and ined but the ice was perfect 

servic seem to be ok for some tabl they were on it and other it was eh mayb they could work on that too

i dont think i will go out of my way to come back i came i saw wasnt thrill back to the east valley i wentlook for a place open on labor day for lunch my cowork and myself end up at sakun thai we were pleasant surpris by the size and nice decor by this veri unassum restaur we were seat prompt and our drink order were taken swift that where the quick servic stop our drink took a while to arriv and it took the waitress a littl longer to take our order i decid on the massaman with pork at medium spice level 

onc our food arriv i was happi with the present the food look veri appet and tast pretti good as well my curri was perfect spice but just a littl sweeter than i prefer it tast like there was too much coconut milk in the dish my cowork enjoy the sweet aspect but i was just happi that i didnt decid to order kang kua sinc that would most like be way too sweet for me they offer brown rice as well which i think is a good touch 

overal we had a pleasant meal here but it definit not the best thai food ive had in town ill be back sinc i work in the areathe latest discoveri on my cupcak crusadejust cupcak is hidden in a larg strip mall shop centerright around the corner from mountain ridg park  skateparki feel these place would do so much better in the regular mall

i will be back for some breakfastsoo this sushi place has been my go to for the last 7 year and have been here mayb 40 time but after last night visit i probabl wont be come as much anymor and main stick to goyemon

th last few time ive come their cut and grade of sushi have been get wors especi this last time super chunki weird cut especi the super white tuna gross the sauc they still put on it is still the same and still realli good though now the special roll my absolut favorit have been the cinderella french kiss mango style and danc eel so when i order them again last night all of them except the french kiss was wrong all of them were skimpi look to start look like they shrunk half in size from last year danc eel had one babi piec of eel on one piec the rest were cover with spici tuna no eel on danc eel roll realli mango style had no avocado on top like it say on the menu and the insid was also wrong all i saw was imit crab that all cinderella had no kiwi sauc or the other sauc that it suppos to have and main imit crab as well the bake green mussel have save them a few more chanc and are still my ultim favorit from ani sushi place warm and gooey and flavor thank you for not chang but serious what happen to you kaya  you were sooo good up until 1 year ago when i first start reaaalli notic a chang thank good my stamp card was fill out so i got one person free last night becaus it was definit not worth it i will give you 3 more chanc sinc weve had a long marriag but just warn you we might have to get a divorc i expect better food 

i met up with 5 other friend for some grub and some drink i had the corn beef with cabbag and it so so freak bore i need to add the spici mustard to give it a littl flavor

friend 2 had turkey burgerbland and bore

4 had a burgersam 
5 had fish and frysth fish was good the frys were cold 

the drink were good but i is not hard to make captain and coke stoli and coke jack and coke some fruiti drink and a beer 

i wish it was betterquit a few irish pub have sprung up in the west valley one by the peoria spot complex the auld dublin and most recent one at west gate i have been to each spot and i have frequent tad mani more time i like the atmo at tad howev i question the rusti farm tool and net hang on the wall after come here for a few happi hour over the last few month and take advantag of the special price happi hour is a good time to come some of the happi hour special are 1 off draft beer half price appet and extend lunch menu definit make this time of day a better valu tad has a select of about 12 draft brew includ one of my favorit smithwick on one visit i tri the fish n chip which are pretti standard and tasti 

bargain hunter alert  tie into the happi hour tad offer lunch portion until 6 pm  smaller portion and more cost effective

th auld dublin is a solid spot for happi houri visit hurri 4 curri on a saturday even for a take away dinner i believ i visit on their second or third day of operation

i enter a restaur with modern decor that was spotless clean have read about the restaur in the republ prior to arriv i immedi head toward one of the two flat screen televis to place my order order was easi and quick and the menus offer descript of the indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisine

i order butter chicken naan bread and basmati rice this came to 850 it was a pleasur to see as is done in mani other countri that the tax was includ in the price of each item while i could have swipe my credit card to pay at the menu monitor i chose to pay cash and receiv servic from the friend ladi at the cash regist she also valid my park in the az center garag my butter chicken you can choos naan or rice as a side was 750 and my naan was anoth dollar which brought the total cost of my meal to 850 becaus i was order take away i did not order a drink i did howev see that the restaur is appli for a liquor licens presum for the sale of beer given that there is no bar in the quick servic space

aft a wait of mayb five minut i receiv my food in what one might describ as higherqu chines food box the naan bread was wrap in foil

aft a short drive home i transfer my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner while the rice was veri well cook general fluffi and not clump togeth the naan as the republ also report was somewhat disappoint while it was definit naan and not pita bread i found my serv to be almost crackerlik in textur and too cool of a temperatur i assum this may be becaus the naan was prepar earlier in the day i wonder though if they could have devis a way to warm the bread befor serv in a convect oven my butter chicken was flavor but also rather cool in temperatur portion size were more than adequate

when i visit the restaur was empti becaus i hope this restaur will surviv i think the concept is novel i sent some of the concern detail abov in the form of construct critic to the restaur after eat my dinner would i return sure i enjoy a healthi fill and flavor dinner for a fair price and when i return i will be happi to adjust my star rate upward if some minor improv have been madei choos fresh  easi when i want a fresh meal for a singl meal typic lunch or dinner i dont typic do my groceri shop at fresh  easi but if im on a break of head home from work and want a meal i know i can alway reli on fresh  easi 

they have plenti of individu wrap food option rang from heat  serv item to sandwich and side i do think that sometim the food can be a bit overpr for the amount im purchas i also think that for be a store call fresh  easi they should have more caloriefriend item i find myself do a decent amount of packag turn to look at the calori and then place it back on the shelf when i realiz that it way higher than i anticip they also dont have mani bake chip option this is one of those store where the name can deceiv you into think everyth is healthi but it import to read the packag 

allinal im a fan of fresh  easi and im alway happi when one around i just wish they had one closer to where i livedecent food and the price are pretti good we went a few time but it realli not worth the drive without a groupon  too mani restaur in town that make a better burgerwell they may live up to it greasi name but they also have some surpris up their sleev for exampl they also have salad and chicken sandwich besid tasti look burger and milkshak on my first visit i enjoy the big kahuna chicken sandwich which is their take on the teriyaki chicken sandwich and i use all the will power i had to not order the fri to go with it instead i went with the side salad i sat on the funki patio and enjoy take in the old gas station sceneri such as gas pump i also notic a sand volleybal court in the back and it look like they do volleybal game and activ on occas the meal came out fast by the server with a huge smile on her face the chicken sandwich was juici and tender and the sauc on it was pretti flavor i was surpris that it was a creamybas teriyaki sauc which turn out to be pretti tasti and the grill pineappl were the perfect touch the food was decent but noth that id say is a musttri but the atmospher and decor has a lot of charact all in all it a nice spot to visit for a casual meal dure a day in cave creek next time i visit ill tri the kobe burger and a milkshak but for my first visit i can definit confirm that id visit this greasi eateri againi cant vouch for the sacred of anyth here but the frybread was veri good  my daughter got one with powder sugar  it had a lighter and more airi qualiti than other frybread i have tri thus far 

given ive onli had frybread 34 time in my life but compar to the other one sacr hogan was lighter  for frybread  is that sort of a foodi oxymoron  light frybread  hmm

the atmospher is pretti basic  i will give them anoth tri for a meal sometim  im sure even though their frybread is lighter a meal on frybread is not someth to toy with  serious  ive had a meal on frybread befor it has been larg enough to share or hold you through sever mealwe read about the open of region in the phoenix new time blog chow bella and found the perfect opportun to check it out when anoth food lover happen to be in the area  we were particular excit due to the lack of good restaur in this part of n scottsdal and went in with high hopes

upon enter we were told that the restaur seat area would be close in 5 min 9pm and that the bar would be serv until 10pm the bar look much more invit ani way so that was fine with us we were also immedi given a coupon for a free appet with purchas of ani entre which we happili accepted

th concept for region is that in addit to their regular menu which focus on comfort food there also a month menu that rotat through the differ region of the us  our main reason for come was that we were entic by the deep south menu which run until the end of march weve alway love southern food but lolo mrs white and staci are just a bit far for us to go regularly

from the menu of the month we order the fri green tomato  okra 6 and shrimp  grit 9 from the regular menu prime rib slider 9 rhode island calamari 8 and mac and chees 15

the grit were rich and creami  easili the best dish and deserv a spot of the regular menu the tomato and okra were disappoint not coat with a cornmeal crust which would have deliv a much more satisfi textur contrast  it just made us crave for staci fri okra

th slider came in 3 and were fill with slow roast prime rib which were unfortun a bit dri the fri onion and horseradish sauc provid good contrast and kick the top of one of the bun was miss upon notif the manag prompt brought one out and comp the cocktail one of us order 

with the calamari the batter bare adher to the calamari so much of the crispi bit were left on the plate mac and chees came in an entre size and was made with penn which was perfect al dent and the chees was creami and well balanc i would happili order it again if it came without the lump crabmeat and was price sub 10 we could visual see the lump crab meat but bare tast it as it was overwhelm by the chees altern they could take a page from the tuck shop lobster mac and present the crab on top

mark the bartend was veri friend and profession and the manag was veri respons the restaur had their soft open last wed and obvious still has some kink to work out especi in the deepfri area the concept is great and veri much need in north scottsdal  creativ comfort food at veri reason price given time i hope the execut will step up to the plate and deliv the home run that im rout fori have a bad feel about the longev of this one i went in want to be impressedit look super cute and just my style from the outsid how can you go wrong with the word bakeri in the titl but  after eat there i can say the food was just meh my kid both comment it was just okay  and they even  had some of the bake good 
the decor is  part bistro part old time feel  look cute with bake good in cover glass tier on the counter  the servic is just like paradis or wildflow bread but the food is not as good or creativ in my book 
mi chop salad was chop so small that i couldnt quit eat  it and wish i had a spoon  flavor in the salad was uninspir and got old quick  
as my oldest said  i cant quit see us go backpanera  paradis  wildflow  corner bakeri  i would rank them

1 wildflower
2 
3 
4 panera
5 corner bakery
6 paradis bakery

thi is of cours onli a rank of these upscal concept sort of place where you can order thing like soup or salad  half a sandwich and a muffin or cookie

and you can pull out your laptop and use free wifi often what bring me inmy friend heard of a new buffet off the strip in the m resort hotel  for 2595 you can enjoy an all you can eat seafood buffet with all you can drink beer and wine  and if you sign up for the imagin reward program you get 2 off the buffet price  

the buffet is pretti huge  i went straight for the king crab leg and shrimp  on my first round i fill 2 plate with food  i would have to say the best item were the crab leg and shrimp  all the other food was just ok  ive had better prime rib and their sushi was just ok  on my second round i brows the asian food and noth realli call out to me  they tri to make a pad thai but it look dri out  it could be that we just went late so they werent make ani new batches

th dessert were pretti good for a buffet  they had lot of mini version of tart meringu eclair creme brulé flan and other stuff i cant rememb  there even a whole case of ice cream for you to choos from  

i wasnt abl to take advantag of the all you can drink beer and wine  i had to run a half marathon in the morn so i onli drank half a glass of beer    

ill have to come earlier next time and give this place anoth shot  mayb with a higher turnov rate the food will look more appeal  2595 for all you can eat and drink is a steal35 stars

i read paulin cs review about this place and i had to go to studio b to check it out

th prime rib were alright 

dessert were good i also like their coffe bar  your choic of espresso cappucino latt you can even have it w a shot of kahlua bailey etc

oh and yes do prepar for long wait 

the onli thing this place got it go for is that they offer free beer  wine and if you sign up for their reward card you can get 2 off of the buffet price each time you dine here 

im not sure if ill go out of my way and drive out here for their buffet id onli come back to this buffet if im on my way drive into the strip or drive back home to lastudio b buffet is locat insid the m resort about 15 minut from the strip our guy friend suggest it for friday night dinner 34 per person  sinc he was will to drive we were down to tri it 

the 730pm crowd loop around the line divid as if they were wait for the newest disneyland ride we were seat in about 5055 minutes

thi buffet is humong i think i read there are over 200 item which made me think it might be a quantiti over qualiti type of place but that wasnt the case food was actual realli fresh 

there are the differ section asian pasta  pizza sushi indian the carv station the seafood area etc im not usual a pasta fan but the bake ziti was so good i kept go back for more of that tart  creami sauc the bread on the fri shrimp were not too crisp i had a pork rib which had a nicelysp rub  was not too fatti for dessert i load up on mini red velvet cupcak yay for cream chees frosting

thre star becaus i normal wouldnt drive too far from the strip for a buffet with a longass line i had a hand of pretti good item but everyth els was not memor i end my meal with an espresso shot lace with amaretto im think a lot of high rate are given becaus wine  beer are includ in the price of your meal im not a beer  wine kinda gal so that perk was complet wast on me now had vodka been flow freeli i might also be inclin to give a high rateit hard to find a reward donut in this citi  and by reward i mean  that tast that bring back all the memori i associ with donut 
as a child grow up in orang counti ca we had not onli winchel donut but mom and  pop joint that  were usual ran by a sweet asian famili who knew how to make a great donut youd find them on almost everi corner from my earliest donut memori of stop for donut on the way to church or mom buy donut for birthday parti   or later when donut provid me comfort dure my parent divorc to the fun of buy a dozen donut on the way home from a wild colleg night  donut have  been there for me  like my own sacr rite of passag thru my life 
okay that might be stretch it a bit but donut are chock with memori for me   so the anticip was high as i decid on my sick day to stop for a comfort donut or two at lamar when i walk in i hope that somehow a littl ole ladi would come out from behind the counter but no instead i order from the local chain   
the first donut was an old fashion  it tast like it was right off of  memori lane  sweet but not sicken great dough  light ice i was taken back to everi yummi donut i ever ador great  i made my second  donut an old favorit  pink ice cake donut here is where it all went horribl wrong  the donut tast dri over cookedwith a gaggi sweet non distinguish icingth horror  well if you love donut go to la mar mayb it was an off day for the frost pink donutand make sure to have a old fashion donut for me090512

was hope to make it in for breakfast but was too late  the onli breakfast item left were almondin shell and a coupl of strawberri fruit tart  i opt to tri a cappuccino and an almond shell while i wait for my chef panino 780 for a full order with side salad to arriv  i believ the shell went for 50 or 75 cent each  it was a veri nice way to begin or end a meal  the panino was veri delight  love the crunchi exterior of the press ciabatta and the combin of thickcut ham brie caramel onion and pesto made my mouth and brain veri happi  eat half of the leftov a few hour later prove to be almost as good even without reheat the sandwich in the toaster oven and i polish the rest of the panino for breakfast the next day  i recal that the salad dress on the side was noth to write home about but i appreci the ad green to round out the meal

i dock a star for the cafe mediocr decor  i didnt feel like i was in a french cafe  i cant even recal if the music play was french  addit the onli other peopl there besid the server also owner and cook was a tabl of elder women play an actual game of mahjong a chines tile game with mani variat possibl play on a tabl with three or four peopl not the comput memori game  i wonder in franc do french peopl play mahjong in american restaur  was tickl to see that my receipt tray had the mona lisa on it cute  anoth star dock for have weak coffe  yes great coffe servic deserv a full star in my book  the cappuccino was the worst id ever shell 4 for and no wonder the drip coffe i replac the calor cup with tast almost like water  ive want to come back a few time sinc to tri breakfast here but if i cant look forward to a great cup of cafe avec un bon petit dejeun then whi even bother  perhap it was an offday for coffe  i will visit again veri soon and see if breakfast is just as funclosei would give this place a 35 if i could but there no option for it  upon enter this place i did get more a crowd and intens fast pace feel rather than a homey breakfast feel  the wait for a tabl was 510 min which i thought was good consid they were slam with a bunch of famili  

onc be seat i read the menu thorough just so i would get someth i like rather than someth id hate  after a good 5 min our waitress came out and gave us our drink she then return later to take our order  i thought that her knowledg about the food was a littl less than pleas  i ask about the holladais sauc and she didnt know hot describ it other than it was yellow hmmmm i wasnt too pleas there so i order someth i was familiar with 

order were 

mont cristo  turkey ham chees and bread dip in french toast batter and fri to a crisp  it was veri interest it came with syrup and 2 side of either hash brown or season potato and egg  although the concept was interest i thought it was ok  it was a weird combin and it did go togeth but it someth i probabl wouldnt tri again  

biscuit and gravi  biscuit serv with gravi the name say it all  the biscuit were realli soft and the consist of it with the gravi did compliment each other well odd though i prefer the biscuit and gravi at south point coronado cafe  now that say a lot especi sinc that not vote best of las vega  the gravi was ok there were meat here in there but it did tast a littl water down  

there were a lot of other thing that i did want to tri but it didnt seem as interest  id probabl return here caus the servic was good and the seat was fastthe atlanta yelp empress kathleen m came to town this week to help out with the yelp rock event so sinc shes a fan of ethnic cuisin i decid wed tri tandoori time  

it is kind of hidden in the shop center  i suggest they get some better signag  but were smart girl and we found it it look pretti dead from the outsid but onc we were led to a tabl we saw a few other parti dine includ some friend of mine on a date

whil our servic was attent enough our waiter kept attempt to talk us out of what we want to order and tri to sell us someth differ  for exampl when we order the chicken tikka masala he suggest we order chicken chile instead  no thank  and when we order the bengun bhartha eggplant dish he suggest someth els too  we stuck to our gun though  we were girl that knew what we wanted

in addit to the dish abov we share a hous salad rice and a tandoori roti whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven  we wouldv order an appet of sort ie samosa but you have to do that dure certain time of the day and we miss our window for that  kind of odd huh  nonetheless i enjoy everyth although i ad a lot of hot sauc  it didnt have much kick without it  gotta love that hot sauce

i realli enjoy indian food and dont eat it as often as id like  it seem that mani peopl are not up for adventur eat i dont get it  regardless id come back to tandoori time in a heartbeat  it didnt knock my sock off but it was a pleasant experi with attent servic decent ambianc and moder price  thank to kathleen m for tri someth new with megabi k was sweet enough to cater to my indian crave and we ventur out to tandoori time on my never end quest for qualiti chicken tikka masala as we scan the menu i was disappoint to see that a larg portion of their option were onli avail dure lunch time get separ menus so im happili oblivi to what im miss 

i am a chicken tikka masala girl through and through while i may order other dish in addit to ctm i have to get it at everi indian joint i go to yes yes i know it may not be the most authent thing but i dont care i love it so dont you dare tri to talk me out of it and that exact what our waiter did which made me nervous was the ctm all that bad no it was fair but the waiter attempt to lead us down a differ road make me wonder if they realli do have wonder food here it just not ctm tri it out and go with their recommendyou know what i like
i like cocktail sauc with my fish and my chip and  i like cocktail sauc on my fish sandwich
pet fish and chip a wholli own subsidiari of montgomeri burn enterpris take a page from their boss handbook when they say let the mass have their tartar sauce
that right they put cocktail sauc on their fish sandwich 
that is in fact the sole pun intendedit definit not sole in their fish sandwich reason to visit pete phoenix institut i know
tri to get them to do that at your micki or your wendys
i know that pete make other thingsburg chicken hot dog etc for all i know they make filet mignon on a skewer never order ani of it 
the sign say pete fish and chipsi think im skate close to edg by have them put the fish slab on a bun
pet make a pretti decent fish sandwichnot much better than the aforement mcds or burger king but certain no worsein fact it just may be the same fish sandwichunidentifi generic as to type of fishposs even a soy base fish like food substancei couldnt tell youif this thing was ever swim it was month ago
but you put chees on it and add a littl cocktail sauc and ill swing through drive through everi 6 month or sotri the seafood pasta special here a year or so ago and was underwhelm too much crayfish and not much flavor as i recal  dessert here are much better though warn those with a sweettooth should be extra care dine at the eagl buffet next door especi on mother day unless you have the disciplin to put extra time at the gym

had lunch here today 310 turkey club smoke turkey bacon lettuc tomato swiss chees and mayo on fresh croissant and crispi sweet potato fri as my choic of side  yes i chose this spot onli bec i had a crave for spf  

i onli had 30 minut time allot for lunch which explain the lack of photo but i thought a simpl sandwich and fri wouldnt take much time  was i wrong  first of all it took 5 minut from the moment i was seat at the tabl for my server to take my order  second my order took more than 15 minut to arriv but i had to send the fri back as they were veri soggi  after a few minut howev these fri were perfect  the sandwich includ process turkey slice circular slice straight from the bag and a lettuc leaf that was just larg enough to span the length and width of the croissant  i did appreci the fact that the slice of bacon were pretti lean i am one to trim off cook fat from bacon befor place them back in my sammi  i know im not the onli one that doe this  

i wouldnt recommend the turkey club or other sandwich where process meat might be use  perhap the entre would be your best bet pun intend  i do suggest you tri the dessert i spi small glass of milkshak be deliv to their lucki owner and the extracrispi sweet potato fri  neighbor ooh and ahh over their love slice of strawberri and cream cake with coffei stop at cafe mix for lunch  for a newer pad site restaur i was somewhat impress with the warm atmospher  

i order a gyro special which came with choic of side  i went with the greek salad which was pretti goodfresh crisp lettuc nice dress and authent kalamata olives

th gyro itself was good plenti of meat tzatziki dress lettuc and tomato

th servic here was prompt and effici if not over friendly

if your in the mckellip  greenfield area there are not alot of food choic and i would say this is probabl one of the better onei cant believ how hard it is to find a great jewish deli in the metropolitan phoenix areath select is few and what we do have is mediocr at best so i am sad to say that if i want an almost great jewish deli i have to drive all the way to surpris 

archi deli offer probabl the best yet in delicatessen cuisin they offer the right kind of sandwich and even has blitz kugl potato latk and knish that arent half bad i was impress with their bagel select and more than happi that they werent like einstein bagelspur bread i even like their pickl tray 

but i have to say that there were a few negativesfirst of all and i am realli not cheap i swear their price are outrageousi ask how much a fruit tray was for about 810 peopl and they quot me 35 i couldnt believ that my brisket sandwich was 11and it didnt even come with fri i was offer cole slaw or potato saladand sinc i dont like potato salad i had to get cole slaw even though my sandwich alreadi had cole slaw on it and in regard to the sandwich it was good and allbut sinc when did challah becom the shape of a hoagi bun and to top it all off our server didnt know the first thing about the menu or deli in general and i did find it funni that my grandma had to get the manag over to let them know that they potato latk need more onion salt in them 

i think with a few tweek archi can be awesom but they do cater to their clientel just fine and it seem like they are alway busi i will be back i am sure with my grandpar wing are pretti good servic was pretti good special are pretti good 
thursday they had a dozen wing for 3 buck with the purchas of a drink

sign was confus thought it said 3 buck for dozen wing and a drink lolit was a busi and rough day at work and i need some comfort that onli some chicken and green could provid i was crave some soul food i spot aileen write up and round up some of my cowork for some hope yummi food 
we arriv at the storefront locat and immedi notic the nice decor insid this is a walk up and order establish with a veri larg menu be sure to grab a menu and step asid so you can read the whole menu or you might miss someth 

i final decid on the chicken and waffl combo and was given a number to sit and wait i was told that my fri chicken would take a littl longer becaus all their chicken is fri when onli when order my friend receiv their order and the tabl was alreadi full of food and my food was still come 

mi fri chicken and waffl with a side of collard green and red bean wrice arriv it was a lot of food i wish it was a lot of amaz food but it wasnt amaz it was middl of the road and unremark 

now dont get me wrong sometim middl of the road is all you need to get the job done at lunchtim i just wish for a littl more spice zip and flavor 

mi fri chicken was fresh fri but the batter was justbatt my chicken was also rather dri my red bean and rice were almost bland i found myself pour hot sauc on all of my food i guess i just wasnt wow it wasnt poor made but it wasnt made with lot of season which i expect from soul food 

i would like to give fat daddi anoth tri i love support local own busi especi when theyr situat among larg chain look forward to anoth looksethe festiv buffet is a rather basic buffet but isnt that what one should expect from a rather basic casino besid it onli 699 for dinner mondaysaturday exclud holiday if you have the amigo card  

on my last visit i didnt see anyth except you arent go to find rack of lamb or caviar here they did have a prime rib and roast turkey station and the turkey was surpris moist and tasti for a cheap buffet there is a mongolian grill italian mexican and bbq section as well plus a small salad bar and the desert albeit simpl one never disappoint 

brunch on sunday will run you a littl more money 1399 with the card but doe includ champagn they serv crab leg then as well  diner have the option of purchas alcohol dure other time my husband and i split a bottl of pinot grigio that cost us 799 the waiter that brought out our wine was friend and seem happi to serv us he came back by later to make sure we were happi with the wine as well 

if you are look for an afford buffet option in the henderson area festiv buffet is aokthink of a chioptl restaur but all grown up  standard mexican drink and food   the interior is clean and simpl but almost stark  the same goe for the nice big patio

it next door to the dilli dalli so it gonna be hard for me to wait 5 min for a beer when the dalli serv then up in 30 seconds

pleas note they had the shittiest music i have ever heard  i swear they were play an entir album by le bebarg or mayb it was the soundtrack from breakin 2 electr boogaloo   holi crap was it badpro  by weight you mean i can get a dollar worth of froyo
con  by weight you mean i can get 500000 worth of froyo

r miso soup was lukewarm ehhhh whatever

salmon nigiri cut were subpar no equal vein of fat line but still tender  though i would have prefer the veining

toro was excellent

rol were good but the rice was a bit on the dri side

servic was excel but the sushi did take awhil i assum this is becaus of the new of the place

i did love the fact that they had fresh wasabi extra charg and it was pureed
i did love that they had vietnamess ice coffe and sweet green tea

so yes i will be back  hope the sushi chef will have more experi  still a few bug to be work out but the owner was awesom and i have high hopei am go to be gentl becaus region has onli been open for a week they are still in the learn phase i was realli excit to have a new place open for lunch as the trend on mill late is busi shut down not pop up the have a  region theme 
to quot from the websit while the core susten at region is american comfort food each month we pay homag to anoth section of our great land  from the midwest new england and the great lake to the pacif northwest rocki mountain and the deep south  we dont stop at cuisin  cocktail and other libat accompani our region tast for a full dine experi that echo the day of home kinda cool

th good
 cool design and nice décor modern and classi veri open and a nice big bar on both the insid and the patio
 order the grill chees club and it came with tomato and bacon  awesome
 veri decent wine and drink select all reason price go along with the region theme

th bad
 we were sat and then wait 15 minut befor anyon came over
 my dine partner was brought the wrong beer
 i ask if i could sub a salad for the fri and was advis i couldnt you have to purchas the salad separ  no half size and the hous salad was 6 buck lame
 they have a pretti limit menu for lunch onli 4 sandwich no chicken sandwich and made to order burgers

th ugly
it smell like the old long wong next to the kitchen no joke sewer 

all in all the meal was decent and i am sure they will work the kink out over time hope so the lifespan seem to be about 6 month for new restraunt on millon my extra day in vega last week i decid to stop by serendip due to it popular in new york  i have attempt to go to the one in new york befor but sinc the wait was so long i fail to tri it out  so the next best thing was to go to the one right across from caesar palac  at first i was a bit disappoint by it decor sinc the one in new york look way better it wasnt the 30 min wait for me sinc the insid venu was just averag to me  so i went to the takeout window where there was also a line  the line wasnt as bad but what was bad was the slow servic it was extrem slow the worker apolog everyon for the wait sinc he was the onli one work there with a cook in the back it just bug me sinc the onli thing i order was the frozen hot chocol dessert and i had to wait a good time for it also it look to me like he was liter take his time even though there was a line outsid oyee that bug me

iron  frozen hot chocol i am usual not a big fan of chocolatey thing sinc i am scare they overdo it on the sweet and chocol thick but i may say it was pretti good  good mixtur of ice and chocol which made it extrem refresh in the hot humid vega weather  my friend and i enjoy it in the mani tabl and seat they had in the outdoor patio which was nice  but of cours the altern was to run insid caesar for some nice air conditioning

i honest wasnt wow by this place it definit did not live up to the hype that the new york serendip has  but if you want dessert and somewher to stop by along your long walk down the strip do check this place outfood i order the blue chees and bacon hamburgersorri yelper im not sure what the exact name is  the burger was pretti tasti the hamburg was juici and all the flavor mix in perfect  the bun look realli cool but i thought it was a tad too dri i also enjoy their sweet potato friesthes are a must tri  the burger was 1650  i wouldnt say it was worth the price but then again it vega so u cant expect cheap price 
frozen hot chocol we order the smallest one it was around 975  let me tell u this tast much better when u order it in the restaur  last time i order it from their to go area and it wasnt as tasti  i love how it tast more like real chocol and not fill with the heavi milk flavor
servic super slow our waitress was pretti lame  she never check up on us and pass our tabl at least 5 time befor she took our order  

all in all the food was pretti good but didnt outweigh the high price and slow servic to be given 4 starit start off bad kept roll down hill from there but luckili finish on a bit of a high note 

11pm and this place close at midnight  first of all it vega and whi would a place like this locat liter right on the strip smack dab in the middl of las vega blvd close at midnight  that seem ridicul but we made it with plenti of time to spare appar this place is a full servic restaur with a bar insid and not just a dessert joint  the hostess insid inform us that sinc we had a larg parti that it would be quicker if we order from the window and sat outsid  cool that sound easi enough  so we perus the menu post right outsid next to the window that you have to order from  after a good 15 minut wait we get to the window and orderbut wait  not all the item we want were avail at the window what  the menu is right there  appar cake are not avail at the window  so the guy at the window told us all we had to do was go back insid and order at the bar  then take our food outsid again  ok here we go again  

i order at the bar and the bartend seem a bit peev that we were do that but lighten up at the end  he was after all tri to serv the patron at the bar too and it seem weird to order all this food at the bar  whatev  what made thing wors was that one of my friend want a big pretzel and when i order it the bartend told me that i had to order it outsid becaus it was onli avail at the window  wtf  the food all come from the same kitchen right  so i sent my friend outsid and by this time they were close up the window so they told her she couldnt order  oh hell no  she wasnt have that so she veri stern told them that she would be get her pretzel and that they would be serv her  and they did

enough of all that  the order system could use some help  that obvious

th dessert were all huge and were meant to be share amongst 2 or more peopl  did we  hell no  this is of cours vega and we were live a life of excessif onli for one weekend 

im happi to report that the carrot cake all 12 inch plus of it was deliciousaccord to my friend  the humbl pie a peanut butter pie with graham cracker crust was a bit too overwhelm in the peanut butter tast  the same goe for the cant say no sundaetoo much peanut butter and not enough everyth els  the pretzel was an epic fail  epic  the frozen hot chocol was a disappoint  perhap if i didnt have it serv togo it wouldv had a better present then a better tast  for me it was an overpr frappachino

th best dessert in this place hand down was the deep fri oreo sunda  it huge it messi and it delici  yes that still the sunda that im talk about

th cake and pie slice run about 710 and can easili feed 23 peopl  the sunda are 15 and also feed 23  if they could figur out a more effici order system theyd certain have my busi againwithout the pretzel

should be more like 2 starsbut it vega babyvegathe line is ridicul most of the time 
i hate line but im will to wait for the frrrozen hot chocol or their deep fri oreo  ice cream

serendip 3 isnt some place to visit while on a diet but who the crap is gonna go to vega and diet

a far as reg food goe it just meh
th sweet treat are where they at

verdict
thes kind of treat make more sens in a tropical247 climat like hi hey hello hi justsay isthatagoodenoughexcuse
haha but im glad i know where to go when im in need of some cheer up while in vegathis is one of my goto spot in las vega  the first few time i came here i order just the frozen hot chocol which is pretti awesom some of the hotel that you stay at pari or harrah will give you a discount on the frozen hot chocol yay

on time i did order some food and was unpleas disappoint i got the las vega burger and the lobster dip both of which were soso the burger was extrem dri even though i order it in medium rare and the lobster dip was just a bit too salty

if you want to check out onli their dessert i recommend order it togo insteadi think i over hype this up to myself after see rachel ray go to the nyc locat on 40 a day way back when i visual fell in love w the big ol cup of frozen hot chocol that she share w her hunni that i told myself ill do this one day w mine

fast forward to my past weekend in vega where i final rememb to come here and must say it put a damper on thing wait was too long this onli made me all the more psych to get my hand on that frozen hot chocol it must be hella good to take this long right ahhh no it was tasti but noth spectacular velveti rich and nice frozen good to share w someon but melt pretti fast kinda didnt hit the spot for me that foot long hot dog we got was ok i think i was more excit about that than my chocolate

mayb the nyc one is better who know i shall save myself for thatafter be forc to watch the movi i knew i want to tri out this ice cream shop  ive been avoid stop by sinc this place is alway busi  i mean line wrap around and everyth  that mean it must be good right so on one of my recent trip i decid to brave the sun and the long line and tri me some serendipity

i onli tri one thing on the menu so this review will be a short one  i had the much talk about frozen hot chocol  it was decent the serv size was overkil and it was a truli decad and rich treat  it was just a littl too sweet and powderi for my like and i think it had more whip cream than actual frozen hot chocol  i think i would much rather spend my money insid caesar palac at a delici dessert shop with the best macaron ever  for a frozen hot chocol though i think ill stick with san francisco ghirardelli square

thi ice cream shop is sicken cute  like everi other place on the strip the theme is rampant and the atmospher is worth a few selfi for instagram  stop by if your an ice cream fanat  i hope you dont mind the wait and the obvious tourist trap that make up serendipflavor flaaaaaaaaaav

i was drive by this place on the weekend and couldnt help but notic the huge sign by the road that said flavor flav 99c wing i return today to give them a tri as well as snap a pic for my photoblog

 been here onc befor to tri their 99c pizza slice those were pretti blah and i had no urg to return until i saw the sign so this review is for the new flavor flav chicken wing as i drove back to the offic the wing had an extrem oili smell and i was expect a mediocr experi fortun they were surpris tasti if a littl salti probabl not worth 99c a piec but decent nonetheless

i was talk to nell behind the counter the flavor flav thing is a new endeavor for now they just have the basic fri wing that are bread with some pepper they will soon expand with a few more flavor like lemon pepper call lemon time becaus of flav clock shtick and a sweet wing call love or someth becaus of the whole flavor of love thing

i gave them my number and email she want to contact me onc they launch the new flavor so that they can get an opinion on how they tast honest im not sold on the wing at that price but im down to tri the new flavor when they come outso far so good  i bought their cure pork shoulder to use as a bacon at the farmer market   tasti stuff look forward to tri other producti will have to write a review base specif on the last half dozen review which give this establish a veri poor rating

believ me i was nervous go in as i had just finish read noth but negat feedback

1 general appearance
thi littl stripmal joint has it own uniqu style with three saltwat tank hold tropic fish and a koi and turtl pond  all appear and smell clean  the center of the restaur is rais and individu booth are partit with white curtain  it give the place a more romant and enchant atmospher  wall are decor with the tradit thai artwork  i did note that there were two tabl near our that were not clean or clear dure our time there  howev our booth and tabl were clean our silverwar polish and glass free of spot or stain  our server also had a clean appear in white cloth and apron

2  service
w were seat immedi but no one came for our drink order for quit some time  after drink order were place it took about ten minut until we receiv our beverag  the thai ice tea came after about 57 minut the mango smoothi in about ten and the two glass of water we request at the begin came after everyth els  we did not receiv a place set such as napkin and silverwar but food was deliv within 15 minut  server did stop at our tabl throughout our meal to make sure we had everyth we need  he wasnt over friend but i felt that was due to english not be his first languag  consid there were onli three other occupi tabl servic was slow  it appear the entir restaur had one server and one cook  so i have to be understanding

3  food
i love curri and i order the pumpkin curri which had been recommend by other review  i am sensit to spice so i order it mild  mild is exact how it came to the tabl  the curri was veri flavor and creami and i could tast the pumpkin  it was veri veri delici  the chicken meat was white tender and plump  the carrot were sweet and cook to perfect  it appear the curri also had either a butternut squash or cut of pumpkin meat  i high agre that there were way too mani onion i simpli scoop them out  in the futur i will order the dish without onion  asid from that temperatur of the curri was perfect and i was veri happi with it and the 995 price

second item order was the tom kha coconut soup for 895  with mushroom and generous portion of white chicken breast meat cook in
thai spice coconut milk and lemongrass it was also delici  onli complaint i have about it is the massiv amount of onion  which liter compris half the dish  again will order without onion in the future

a i am not a fan of deep fri food especi those greasi egg roll i opt to stick with order what i know thai restaur do well  curri and soup  i was not disappoint with either

i will be back for the pumpkin curridepend when or if you eat here servic is realli night and day that be said im break this review down to foodservic in am and pm

night  4 stars
at night i notic that there was onli a hand of server work  but this wasnt an issu sinc our food was prepar and deliv pretti quick the server are also veri attent and at the same time in no rush to get your out of the restaur  for dinner i had their special which is their half chicken for 799  starv like a madman i end up get 2 order make that one full chicken for me  yes i finish it yes i was stuf this was pretti and cheap consid how much i got  the rest of the menu actual look pretti good and there enough of a select for everybody

morn 2 stars
it actual busier in the morn and they know this my issu servic realli lag here  with 8 server work you would think that water and our order would be quicker than 15 minut food come out quick onc you final get someon to take your order  it the preorder part where you need some patienc  what wors onc you get your food your check is also hand to you it almost like they cant wait for you to leav unlik at night where our server told is to take our time  for breakfast i got their 3 egg white omelet wspinach and mushroom this was so delici that i almost move the star up to 3

i had a good experi at night and a poor one in the morn  i think that my overal rate of 3 star is fairlast night my husband and i drove to town squar to hit up our new favorit place  cana when we walk up to cana we were told it was close for a privat event bummer

w consid all the option in town squar it was 630 pm  so too late for yardhous happi hour btw screw you yardhous and your 36 pm hh not in the mood for blue martini hmmm whi not tri someth new 

i honest wasnt thrill with my husband choic it look pretti lame and the food menu wasnt excit me howev happi hour end at 8 pm there big plus and i was curious 

i have to admit for the type of place it was cheesi corpor western theme slutti bartend all the thing i hate i was pleasant surpris by the qualiti of the food and drink price 

we had blue moon and pear cider 3pint and tri the nacho chicken lettuc wrap and the ahi tuna 7 each 

mi husband declar the nacho the best restaur nacho ever ok appar hes easi to please

chicken lettuc wrap was differ caus the chicken was fri and dip in sesam and awesom the lettuc and fri wonton the glorious chicken was serv with seem gratuit and we didnt eat that howev we love the chicken freak awesom littl fri nugget of sesam good 

tuna was a pleasant surpris i would say it compar to what i usual get at yardhous ahi tuna crunch salad but it had peanut in the salad a creamier ie less healthi dress and the tuna had a nice ponzu on it the serv was smallish but veri similar in size to yardhous 

as mention abov the bartend were particular plastic and slutti look they act particular unprofession gossip loud amongst themselv the entir time we were there but that all to be expect in a corpor cheesebal vega place 

overal i guess what im say is this place isnt all that bad if your ever stuck here like i was food is surpris good for corpor bar food and the drink price are reason dure hhhit up cadillac ranch just in time for their happi hour  as advertis it monday through friday from 4 pm to 8 pm  half off all drink and half off appet  it actual 7 select appet but half off all drink still

w order a coupl of drink off their cocktail menu 
 pearfect 59 cadillac enjoy our signatur cocktail made with grey goos la poir and fresh pear pure 10  we were surpris to see it arriv in a martini glass someth to think about if your expect a pint glass  it was sweet and you can definit tast the pear puree

 sevill experi a delight and refresh blend of sauza hornito plata citrong fresh mango pure and fresh lime juic 10  this arriv in a pint glass and you could definit tast the alcohol in it  decent overal  

we were initi go to order a bunch of their half off appet but chang our mind after we saw their 7 select appet menu  

they did offer a complet dinner for two for 2995 from monday to friday from 4 pm to 8 pm  add 2 well drink  3495  you can choos one select appet to share one select entre each and one select dessert to share

 kettl chip thin slice potato deep fri to perfect and serv with garlic cream sauc and blue chees crumbl  finish with a balsam drizzl and scallion  a hearti portion of tasti potato chip with a yummi creami garlic sauc and a decent amount of blue chees crumbles

 candi pecan pork chop one thickcut chop grill and crust with candi pecan  serv over caramel onion mash potato and green bean  their regular entre cours includ two pork chop but you onli get one in the dinner special  a nice crust on that pork chop

 bourbon sirloin steak 8 oz beef sirloin season and broil to perfect then place on a demi glaze  serv with garlic mash potato and saute green bean  the regular entre cours is a 10 oz cut  our was also serv with corn  

 strawberri fri cheesecak  onli avail on the dinner special  ask the waitress about it and she couldnt say much beyond that she realli like it  she didnt think it was deepfri sinc it wasnt oili  it actual a flaki pastri with the cheesecak mixtur insid and cover with cinnamon sugar  serv with a strawberri sauc and cream

food and servic were okay noth special  the busboy were quick about clear out the dish as they need  we probabl wouldnt eat or drink here without it be happi hour or they were offer a special  

some special they are offer 

sunday salsa night 8 pm to close with a salsa instructor from 9 pm to 10 pm
3 corona and corona light from 9 pm to close
5 hous margarita and cadillac margarita from 9 pm to close

monday kid 12 and under eat free from 11 am to 10 pm with purchas of ani full price entre free bull ride for all kidtime for a review updat my initi ohmygodtheresaveganrestaurantamilefrommyhous infatu is now over i live veri close to lh so i go there a lot

lov hut is pretti good they have some veri tasti dish spici cha cha bbq bagutt are some of my fav and they have some not so great dishes

th real reason for my dropdown in star is that it alway a pain in the ars to order what you want at love hut you would think that a vegan restaur would be total okay with substitut omiss etc as that what vegan must do at most restaur but no it alway a royal pain at love hut

th other day my wife want to tri the tuno faux tuna sandwich on the baguett roll instead of slice bread i call in to place a phone order and tri to order it i made it clear that i would be happi to pay a bit extra for the baguett bread if necessari didnt matter they would not do it no way no how i tri to bargain with the phone employe who blame it on someon els and said she had to go check with the cook if it was possibl how would it not be possibl to use a differ type of bread that they alreadi have either way they would not budg at all so i couldnt get what i want veri annoy and frustrating

 also tri other substitut and dish modif and it alway a pain

they no longer give free refil on ice tea cite cost which is disappointing

on day i ask about the complementari appet soup that they give in store ask if i could get it for to go order the employe i spoke with explain that they dont give it out on to go order becaus of soup contain cost but if i brought in my own soup contain theyd be happi to give me some so the next time i place a to go order i brought in a littl plastic soup bowl and request some they bare gave me ani soup in it and they gave me a hard time about it

bottom line is that they need to be better at provid what the custom want and less about penni pinch as it is veri annoy and it doe not make me want to go back

chang up the menu by offer uniqu limit time dish special would also great improv the place as much of the menu seem to be veri similar the same flavor soy protein is in just about everything

hop they can improvi want to say how berrygood this is  or that i like it berri much  but the truth is it not the best yogurt  it a nice treat if you want a small blah
 fro yo it not do it yourself  so you portion is not veri generous  and i didnt think the flavor are earth shaking

okay who am i fool   i miss  sweet life gelato this deli is adjac to the sport booksport bar area in the m hotel and casino 

we stop in for a quick bite after play the tabl for a littl bit on our way out it a nice option for a meal the deli meat was fresh there was a nice option of differ meat for sandwich there were sever side to choos from but we skip side and opt for a salad the sandwich are made to order the tomato and lettuc was crisp and fresh the accompani pickl was crunchi and yummi too 

we also got a cobb salad all the item were fresh it was a generous portion of ingredi the dress was good but they had onli a small select of dressings

in all it a decent place to eat noth gourmet price were on the high side there were other food option if you want hot dog fish and chip or other dish2nd chanc today 

thing are get better at bacon there was no wait on a monday at 10am the food was serv prompt and well cook they have recent ad much need booth and i love em

it did howev requir pull teeth to get our check and get out of here

keep work on it guyi met a girlfriend for brunch on saturday morn at bacon the restaur is open and airi insid with a cute littl bar i sat at the bar sinc almost everi tabl was occupi when i arriv around 11 am the bartend mari ann was such a sweetheart and we chat quit a bit while i wait on my friend

mi friend and i both had a mimosa serious it not brunch without one which was almost 9 each now grant you do get a littl bottl korbel so basic you are get two mimosa for the price of 1 but with other valley restaur offer 13 mimosa at brunch i thought bacon was overpr it took us some time to decid what to eat sinc there were so mani delici sound choic on the menu my friend decid on the three egg breakfast while i decid to tri the breakfast burrito i wish the food had live up to how delici it sound on the menu my burrito was averag and i wish the bacon in the burrito had been cook a bit more but the real killer was the potato i love breakfast potato but these were a real dud they werent even cook all the way and were too greasi for my taste

for our two mimosa and two entre our bill came to 35 for the price i was just not impress with the qualiti while i will give bacon a second tri i will not be race back sinc there are better brunch option in the valley       sunday brunch buffet       

ah it a raini sunday morn  what better time to go out for some buffet especi mexican buffet      dos gringo has one so let whip over there

first of all dos here is a veri screwi place outrag junk up with all kind of sign pictur joke paint on the wall  so on  no other custom were around right at open time of 11 am but by 1105 the place was almost full to capac with more loud earthi peopl than a hell angel wed recept  ive never seen a trailer park full of tweaker empti out into a restaur so fast

now there were 15 main food select for everyon to reach in front of each other to get includ huevo ranchero chees enchilada chile verd chorizo santa fe chicken sausag bacon bean  rice of cours  much more plus a good number of top avail but no salad or soup  everyth was good  my server was nice

sunday onli 11 am to 3 pm 799i wish yelp would let us give half starscaus this place would definit be get 25 star from me howev sinc i dont have that luxuri and sinc im feel generous well go with 3 

suffic it to say i didnt think this place was anywher near as good as some of my foreyelp accord to my dinnerm who also live in phoenix the restaur at the claredon hotel has had some ident crise in the pastgallo blanco is mere the latest manifest and has onli been open a few week the ambianc was pretti good earn this place one of it starsth dim lit minimalistdesign dine room with expos concret floor lent itself well to the theme of the restaur with great big window on one end

our waitress was an ador blond from manchest england who was veri sweet and attent and the servic was fabul the whole eveningseri our food came out in the blink of ani eye i know other have complain that the servic was slow so all i have to say to them is that mayb they step up their game in the past few day or somethinganyway it was wick fast point for ms manchest and the quick entreeserv too 

soher where lack of star come in the food we start with the guacamol which one yelper claim was the best guacamol youll ever tast this is fals it is not the best guacamol youll ever tast it doesnt even rank in my top 10 i guess i like more tradit guacamol becaus this was not tradit and it just didnt realli hit the spot for me it was veri chunki and had actual slice of littl tangerin i think in it the hint of orang was in my opinion a drawback i justdidnt love it or even like it that much i think i make better guac at home along with the guac we also got a tomatillo sauc that was veri boring had some excel tomatillo and this didnt rank

for my meal i order the cochinita torta which is basic pork serv on a bun with some lettuc and some sort of aoili i had read good review about the pork torta but was huge disappoint first of all the bun is likeon that youd buy in the groceri store noth special about it which was slight disappoint it just didnt have the constitut to realli contain or complement the content of the torta the torta content themselv were also noth to write home about my biggest complaint was the fact that there wasnt much pork and the pork that was there wasnt honest all that great the aoili which was serious not much of a step abov mayo total overpow the pork and made the sandwich kind ofsoggi a soggi mayo and pork sandwich that what i had it wasnt veri good

i think next time id go with the tacosmi friend order them and they look lessdisappoint she appear to like them pretti well

th other star that i have to give this place though is for the prices650 for the torta and 400 for the 2 taco we didnt get ani alcohol so all in all we spent 11 apiec i may not have like my food but at least i didnt spend a fortun on it the price is the onli thing that would entic me to come back and tri someth elsone doe not simpli walk into gallo blanco the cozi authent mexican restaur with some twist worth check out

learn this the tough way by seat ourselv at the barjust as we prepar to order some refresh we were approach and ask if we had been seat by the hostess

what hostess

sh sudden appear at the entranc where we were prompt unseatedand reseat to the same locat in a minut pleas dont make peopl feel unwelcom but you didnt come here for my take on the servic you wanna know about the food

i had just a littl appet the pork quesadilla yay it was made with a corn tortilla yay the chees was good and oh my good the green chile they use is some of the best ive had ever i crave more now it total make up for the pork that was a bit bland just the right amount of heatmor than most mexican place but not enough to torment spice n00bs i can alreadi tell their menu has some pretti good stuff

th margarita left a bit to be desir theyr made with sauza blanco  so i dont understand whi theyr so stingi with the tequila the lime pulp at the bottom was a welcom addit but this drink was too heavi on the sweet and too easi on the sour next time ill tri the prick pearor just go with the spike agua frescasth watermelon was freak delicious

also id never heard much about this clarendon hotel befor now but ive heard there a roof up here i dont know if it part of the bar or not but it sure would have been groovi sinc i was chill here dure the eclips im honest intrigu by this place and will be backthis place has so much potenti but the servic suck the bartend obvious dont want to make ani money becaus they ignor you if you come up to the bar we had three or four worker walk by us last night befor we just left

i do love the live band karaok though they do it everi wednesday night and often will give away ticket to their upcom concert if you have the pipes

they get some big name guy here for cheap which is realli excit ive never been to one of these show but i am plan on go befor i move out of arizona

if they work on their servic this place could be one of my favorit bar in the areaoh no i have appar becom a regular here  so i am from the middl of nowher where the definit of dress up to go out entail put on your cutest plaid shirt jean and boot  i think this may be whi i kinda like tobi it remind me of back home  the insid feel like a larg barn with a bar in the middl and a band play live music on a stage  the staff is nice to look at and general pretti swift at get anyth you need  

the clientel has becom variabl  i almost wonder if the band play almost determin the turnout of the kind of patron at tobi  some white trash mix with some true countri folk and for some reason late random hipster and rockabilli guy and gal end up in here too  

in all honesti i think i am still swoon from the first time i step into tobi  i met two of the finest cowboy i have ever met in my life and they turn me out on the danc floor  it is amaz how import first impress aremayb i just keep go back in hope of such a grand night out of beer tequila and cowboy but it usual end up rather anticlimactmeh as my fellow yelper said to me a few day after we ate here no brio review im shock 

i didnt jump on write this review becaus i was pretti underwhelm by the experi the ambienc suck the servic wasnt veri good and the food was total averag 

mi cursor is blink at me and i still dont know what els to say about my time spent here 

ambienc look like an italian cheesecak factori whi are the collumn so huge

servic the bartend kept interrupt us to take our order when we still werent readi jeez doe it look like ive move my menu in the 53 second it been sinc the last time you check and then disappear when we were final readi 

food 
carpaccio not bad but doe it serious need to be that huge the two of us didnt even come close to finish it 
mediterranean pasta pretti much the onli one without a cream sauc on the whole menu they split it for us which was nice and it tast all right with mushroom and chicken and stuff 
tiramisu came out frozen they were super apologet and didnt charg us for the replac but it was still awkward they obvious just heat up a piec which made it melti and just not that great

so yeah that thatjoey had a neat atmospher and okay food

th order process seem needless long consid the few peopl there i would hate to see how back up the line get when it super busy

th italian beef sandwich is basic a french dip  dont let ani over gung ho chicagoan tri to tell you otherwis  they recommend dip where they put the whole sandwhich in the sauc and it like becaus the bread they use is pretti dri  i order my sauc on the side for dip and the bread was fall apart a littl bit as i tri to maneuv it into the cup of tasti but wateri sauc  

whatev i had as a side was total unmemor and the amount of time i wait for them to slap precook meat on a preslic roll was not appropri consid the custom load at the time

275 generous round upi realli enjoy joey select of the chicago radio station the drive 971 fm they featur classic rock

on to the food the polish sausag come standard with yellow mustard two sport pepper and grill onion on a sesam bun in chicago we just say i want a polish imho this is the best item on the menu 

the italian beef can be garnish with roast green pepper and melt chees but their version of roast green pepper fall way short of expect they just thin slice some green bell pepper and steam them plus they use way too much oregano andor salt  pepper in the au jus if i could fix one thing about joey it would be the italian beef

their chicago style hot dog are decent and worth order i use to not like their italian sausag becaus they use to overcook them but they do a good job with them now although they seem to be on the spici side but definit worth order their meatbal sandwich is good san the oregano they realli love their oregano at joey the fri are okay but they do tend to put a lot of salt on them so say  easi on the salt joeyin this case 3 star mean more like mediocre

w thought barri manilow was play tonight  knew we were hell  gone from anywher outsid the hilton so opt to dine at casa nicola

si got soup  salad  reaction was meh it okay but not bowl over

i got the penn alla vodka  thought the samewasnt wow but it wasnt horribl either

th tiramisu was quit yummi  sis fruit w creme anglai was tasti as well

lesson learn to verifi the artistthe lemon shortbread was wonder soft and just a bit more than a hint of lemon the flavor was perfect i would eat the shortbread ani time35 star 

this locat is in the meadow mall i purchas a 6 for 12 groupon which end up make me feel better becaus i wouldnt pay regular priceever

th menu at this locat is limit so dont expect the regular jr menu if you want to eat at this one i order a rocket doubl without lettuc or tomato and fri i realli enjoy my burger and fri they were both made fresh to order my total was 1292 for just the burger and fri no drink that is too steep on the wallet if pay full price and not even get a drink with a coupon i would come back again

ther is a counter if you want to eat at jr or you can sit in the food courtsandella is a fine choic for fella  

you can order pretti cheap but they will tri to upsellus

th flatbread pizza was good but it aint gon make ya jealous

th amount of sweet potato fri will underwhelmus

th place is a decent choic but no one will say hell yesit was good friday last day of no meat so i met up some friend here for lunch

i order the veget confetti grill flat bread i realli like it there a reason whi im not a vegetarian becaus i like my meat but this was actual realli good it come with green pepper sun dri tomato corn chees onion etc of cours it wouldv tast better with some meat on it but it was actual quit tasti for a vegetarian flat bread my friend got their caesar salad that she wasnt too fond of and appar it was a bit over price for a regular caesar salad 

i thought it was a cute littl lunch spot and my flat bread was good it took a bit long to get the food but id come back to tri their other item i was on my way home a littl after midnight and i want a cold drink  this mcdonald is easi to get to  the drive through had three car in front of me but befor long i had my diet coke order and i was soon at the window pick it up

i general dont stop in this neighborhood becaus there are other closer to home but this was perfect last night  a good stop with a pleasant and quick staffi realli realli want to like parlor i have read so mani wonder thing and was excit to tri it out all i can say from last night experi is fail i am blame the coloss amount of failur on the bartend i truli think if he werent such a douch bag i could have realli enjoy this place the atmospher was cool the pizza was tasti and decent price and the 2 pitcher of amber beer i had consum were also excel 2 star for that but man this guy suuuuuuuuuuuuuck total rude i dont recal ever hear him say hello or smile onc appar it was a major nuisanc wait on us  have the abil to proper count money i was reliev when his barback show up though he was cool 1 star to him it irrit that one person can ruin an experi so i will return some other time in hope that someon els is work that nighti want to love you parlor you have such great potenti for so mani reason first off you are smoke hot sorri i mean attract your decor is sensat even when im sit next to the pipework

 also fallen for your person it subtl and sexi mysteri yet calm i dont know how you are abl to make me feel relax and excit at the same time but i like it 

as if it couldnt get better you are creativ you have found way to make me love pasta and i am not realli a fan of italian food your spaghetti with basil pesto and pine nut was a true culinari masterpiec you even let me order it without tomato it was also just the right size the appl smoke bacon soup you made me was ingeni what a delici starter 

howev you had one flaw that i just cannot get over you did not let me order dessert whi was that do you think im fat i had a perfect size dinner you made it for me yourself whi did you wait so long to come back and ask me if i want dessert which i did that i was worri it would take equal as long to get it to me and therefor pass it made me veri sad i had to settl for gelato spot instead 

i love you but if you cant deal with my love of desert it was not meant to be12110
order the duck club httpwwwyelpcombizphotosk1qphakzktrfyfk6uvgqselect7a5vayqfteimbaoicdd9ga minus the red wine tomato jam and instead had pesto on the side along w the roast garlic aioli and the side of fri that come with the entre  look great the fri were perfect  but and perhap the absenc of the red wine tomato jam had someth to do with it i didnt find the sandwich to be anyth to write home about  the delici and crispi applesmok bacon and roast garlic aioli were big pluse and help to round out this review to three star  the tiramisu i had for dessert was veri good httpwwwyelpcombizphotosk1qphakzktrfyfk6uvgqselectaatat23ml5rguqtrmdebnw  your usual espressosoak ladyfing layer w sweet mascarpon and cocoa but w the ad toffeecrunch of pine nut brittl  oh i could use a few bite of that pastri right now 

servic was a littl lack i had notic a woman busili jot down the night special and had ask my server what els were be serv if anyth struck my fanci id have ad more to my tab but he would not and did not go to ani length to get the info  lo and behold as i was walk out the door i look at the board and sure enough there were at least three item that i wouldv glad order for takeout had my server relay the info  hey it was his and the parlor loss in tip and sales

i want to sit at the bar area this time to get a differ perspect of the place but i didnt care for the auster metal chair that contrast w the rest of the wooden furnitur  found it jar especi sinc i felt that the rest of the venu to be cozi and invitthe bf and i came in and we were sat down immedi with some ice water and papadam with chutney as we brows the menu

w decid to get the

mt everest special 2199 which come with mix appet salad papadam chicken tikka dal makhani palak paneer lamb curri chicken tikka rice naan raita for dessert gulab jamun and chai tea  we did not realli get what was on the menu as we didnt get salad or our dessert but kheer rice pud instead i didnt realiz this until look at the onlin menu for this review either way it alot of food but would have been nice to get what we order 

the mix appet was some grill sausag chicken tikka piec a samosa and littl papadam bite it was a veri big plate and was super fill the main dish were decent with the paneer be my favorit my one thing was that the paneer and the dal need a bit of salt but still good raita was more tangi and wateri than most ive had but was good to dip my naan in the kheer was veri nice and not too sweet

chicken korma 1299 entre come with rice it was decent but was more yellow curri flavor than other korma ive had 

we also got some garlic naan 299 think that there might not be enough naan with the mix plate but if we didnt order this the plain naan would be more than enough 

the amount of food for two peopl with that is crazi we had leftov which i had for two separ and still veri sizabl lunch we would have been veri full and satisfi with just the mix plate but we had a restaurantcom certif to use 

servic was okay they start off good with drink refil when they came to drop off food after a while they were do task and seem to be realli into it toward of our meal so we sat there for a while need thing 

overal the food here isnt my favorit indian but decent it definit is the most valu larg portion than ani other ive been tothis place is just okay there are mani rave review and i feel like i may be miss someth i will give it anoth shot if i am in the area but i dont see myself drive out of the way to eat here their buffet is fair limit and most of the food lack ani spice factor it was almost bland and some of it was overcook my favorit part was the rice and the naan i did finish my small plate and had no desir for second the meat were fatti and low qualiti and the buffet was not exact cheap at 1099  tip the owner seem like a nice gentleman and recogn my friend who worship this place the servic howev was close to non exist and toward the end we felt rush i am a fan of indian food and have sampl sever place around town and this would probabl stack somewher in the middl i would be interest in tri their dinner item to see how they stack up in that categori overal just an okay indian buffet with not much separ it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seem to care about his return patronthe chip oh the chip crispi crunchi perfect cook but with a flavour i hadnt tast sinc i was a wee lass get a poke o chip with my grandpar in their wee scottish villag i forgot chip could have a flavour like this at all

and that becaus everyth here includ the batter is fri in anim fat

i was awar of this befor we came so purpos order the grill fish rather than batter as i knew id pay for my sin after and i had plan on onli eat one or two chip but with the massiv bowl in front of me i did pick away and the flavour was justdreamy

howev for the vegetarian member of our larg parti of 13 it wasnt as enjoy it was onli when i tri the first chip that i rememb they were cook in fat the moment i could tast it and it was just at that  moment that catriona cs fri dish arriv be a pesci but absolut nono meat eater otherwis she couldnt have anyth that had been fri so had to forgo the chip and reorder a grill piec of meat 

the fact they cook thing in anim fat isnt explicit state anywher obvious i think it a reason a lot of peopl rave about their food and the chip were sooooo good but for veggi it realli would be good to have a notic at least 

and i do agre with catriona that the grill fish offer were nice but not quit the same as a fri fish supper i went with cod and whilst it was a veri ampl serv and was complet cook it came a littl cold and not quit grill as high as id like the red pepper sauc to go with it was realli nice a side order the salad was quit measli though so my idea of eat grill fish and salad as a healthi meal left me still hungri henc pick on the chips

it is a tradit scottish fish and chip shop and a good qualiti and higher standard one if your visit scotland and want to experi real scottish food and want fish and chip id high recommend the tailend over the mani mani mani other youll stumbl across on the main street where they deepfri burger pizza and mar bars

but for a dine in meal i have to say it wasnt what i would normal choos and i was a littl bit underwhelm the great compani of other yelper chat and the chip did leav me feel satisfi but my fish was quit forgett and i thought it would tast morejust more

if i want fish n chip which is veri rare but if i did i would probabl come here but if i want dinein fish restaur i wouldnt

also veggi be warnyou can find quit a lot of bargain here but keep in mind that the bargain price are due to the fact that the product sold are closeout short code discontinu and damag case product in other word mani of the good in the store are close to or past their best by date and they say so servic is friend and there is a lot of patriot decor in and out of the store have an adventur but prudent spirit and give this place a tri youll never know what deal you may find and new bargain keep come upmy oldest daughter told me she want to go check out american discount food and i said ok ill go with ya   i rememb my boss talk about this place he love it but told me that most product where alreadi past there expect date but he didnt care

so daughter and i got to the store and like the other review have state it a big store clean and full of peopl the staff are extrem friend and help 

 there seem to be no rhyme or reason on how it set up no particular aisl to find certain item on  and just like my boss had told me most item are past the expir date now for me this is an issu the date are on there fora reason right if it in my hous and it goe past that date i toss it out  we all have thing that make us tick this is mine veri ocd on label and expir date lol   also you will see in the freezer section that the meat are repack and seal in a clear bag mark american discount store even froze potato sauc chees  it just was too much for me

so yea  this store is not for me but it not a bad store my daughter found some thing she likewe came on a monday even after a long day and order 
1 tom yum pot seafood  spici 5 1699
2 pad thai chicken 999

4 3 steam rice 450 
5 garlic pepper chicken 999
6 red curri beef 1099
for 8505 automat 18 tip charg after tax 
 
 easi to spot but hard to get to come from the strip off of spring mtn and to this place doe everyon have to make an illeg uturn off valley view haha
 great look bar and dine for a thai restaur but bathroom dont match
 ambianc doesnt match servic 
 lame and lazi servic on a slow even we have to hunt down takki to tell her were readi to order get drink refil remov empti plate organ our own tabl no ass kisser here fail
 tom yum had great flavor strong sour and spici tast hot love it but a bit expens for tom yum too much cilantro
 pad thai chicken was delici just how i want my pad thai to tast 
 seafood delight was a dri and spici i couldnt imagin how it would tast if it were a 5 yike mussel are tini but pack with flavor too much onion 
 garlic pepper chicken pack a punch of garlic a vampir nightmar good with the broccoli 
 red curri beef was pretti good but i should have just gotten the panang ugh
 automat gratuiti  6 or more in party
 sneak charg tip after taxi saw a review of this place on azcentr and was excit to tri it out im a super froyo fan and thought it would be worth the drive from laveen to check out the latest addit to the scene 
it in a good locat next to kierland common and park is easi and plenti the girl at the front counter were also super friend  everyth in the store is pretti healthi so there is no guilt in eat dessert  
but 
the whole menu thing is sort of confus if you havent been there befor all of the yogurt is behind the counter so they sell by the size not the ounc and each top cost extra 
they advertis over 100 flavor but dont go in expect to tast it befor you buy each one is handcreat and i dont think they will do ani takeback becaus your dumb ass think tres lech flavor will tast good as yogurt 
they also had 5 or 6 differ yogurt as their premix flavor of the day howev they were pretti uninspir with flavor like chocol vanilla and peanut butter but the good thing with those is that you can get a sampl first 
if im in the area again it would be worth it to stop in and tri a differ flavor  but im a doityourself kind of girl and think i prefer to buy my yogurt by the ouncwe were curious to tri this place after drive by a few time random so last week we final decid to stop by and tri some of their frozen yogurt  it a cute place insid and the girl at the counter were friend enough  they explain that there were the regular flavor that you could get with top and then there were the custom flavor that you could order but you couldnt get a singl serv of the custom flavor  they had about 7 or so flavor that you could tri in the singl serv and we tri the tastitart and the strawberri flavor which were both pretti tasti no pun intend and we both got oreo top on our yogurt  this place was a pretti good bang for your buck the cup look small but when they fill it up with yogurt it actual a pretti decent size portion of yogurt  

i would definit go back again to tri some differ flavor but it not a place that i would go out of my way to get on a regular basi  but if your in the mood for some qualiti yogurt at a reason price then definit check this place outlove jasons

i wish the food tast the same on each visit i alway order the same thing 70 of the time no problem but the other 30 a problem if the food consist stay the same i would give this 5 stars

on our last visit my french onion soup was so salti i could bare swallow it now i dont understand whi this happen i love french onion becaus i love to dip my sandwich in it but this time i was left veri disappoint 

the store alway seem veri clean and the staff doe seem nice

anoth complaint at this one is that the clean staff is alway clean around the area i am eat this is a major pet peev of mine i am eat pleas clean after i walk away from the tablthe girlfriend and i chose jean georg steakhous for dinner for our first day in vega  we arriv about 10 minut earli for our 745 reserv  the hostess inform us that our tabl would be avail at our reserv time but we could wait in the bar  so we did but decid against order ani predinn drink  less than five minut after our reserv time roll around the hostess track us down and led us to our tabl  after a quick review of the menu we opt for the signatur tast menu with wine pair 

our first cours alma ara caviar over a meyer lemon gele with crème fraich and dill and serv in a hollow out lemon half arriv at the tabl httpwwwyelpcombizphotosqmiho6tkefpc9jygdamqselectng5xpih7eapbtehpvoaxqng5xpih7eapbtehpvoaxq it was beauti present  more import the contrast tast and aromat of this success execut dish realli kick the meal off on an impress note  unfortun our pair wine didnt arriv with the food instead be deliv by our server halfway through our first cours with basic no introduct beyond the appel and variet  our second cours bacon wrap shrimp with papaya mustard and cilantro was well execut and nice present as well but the dish wasnt all that origin in concept and didnt provid the wow of the first cours  sad like our first cours our pair wine again didnt arriv with the food and again it arriv without much of an explan midcours by a differ server than the first  the third cours a roast chilean sea bass top with grill maitak mushroom and a misoyuzu glaze sound outstand in it descript but was the night biggest miss httpwwwyelpcombizphotosqmiho6tkefpc9jygdamqselectng5xpih7eapbtehpvoaxqgetrhnqeg8v60pcuiec0w the fish was cook perfect but it top was excruci salti to the point of be ined  it was so salti that even after scrape it off of the fish it was still salti to point that it overwhelm the delic flavor sea bass   at least by this cours the wine arriv with the food deliv by the second server as was the case with subsequ cours  our fourth cours the grill wagyu filet mignon with graini mustard and warm potato salad in textur was a great rebound as our steak were deadon perfect medium rare tender and flavor httpwwwyelpcombizphotosqmiho6tkefpc9jygdamqselectng5xpih7eapbtehpvoaxquy27bzhugqaet7hnhctpw  it was pair with the best wine of the night a cote du rhone  this cours was the best marriag of food and wine of the night  our dessert cours was the jg candi bar which i can onli describ as six deconstruct candi bar kluge togeth like a sweet rich frankenstein monster httpwwwyelpcombizphotosqmiho6tkefpc9jygdamqselectng5xpih7eapbtehpvoaxqsmnl9rpx6ivduizdsbsa  it was pair with a madera

whil the food was for the most part well execut and the wine was general enjoy the servic side of the hous seem awkward and lack the depth of knowledg one would expect from a fine dine establish like this one  the gf and i arent realli wine snob but we do enjoy wine with our food  if we enjoy a particular wine that were serv in a restaur we often will seek it out and buy it to enjoy at home  therefor it was a huge foul that the servic staff wasnt more familiar with the wine that was be pair with the food sinc we realli enjoy the cote du rhone serv with the filet  in the end i felt the tast menu especi with the wine pair was a poor valu  while we certain never felt rush i got the distinct impress that jean georg steakhous was more concern with get diner in and out rather than provid a truli memor dine experi  what a shamethe servic our server is veri sweet howev hard to track her down onli 1 server at the bar area 

the food happi hour menu rock 5 for all the food veri nice present but veri veri veri small portion

new england lobster roll  good crispi at the bottom creami on the top

beef tartar  weird textur didnt realli like it

k crab louie  soso tast like devil egg

sear scallop  tasti scallop but wish there is one more piece

valrhona chocol custard  creami chocol yumm

whit chocol bread pud  the bestveri solid perform on two separ occas while on a recent trip to the aria resort and casino we were abl to score some bloodi mari special and lord know i need them and while we were at it we order breakfast there was no line to speak of to get in and the servic was realli veri good we were approach immedi after seat and the food was good for the morn after or if your just crave steak and egg this is a good goto spot for a good meal and good servicaria cafe is the new and improv cafe vettro  i realli have no idea whi they chang the name of this place when everyth about this place is exact the same  whatever

aria cafe is a 24hour eateri with your standard eat  i would onli come here for latenight eat  there not too mani latenight or 24hour eateri on the strip  the food here is on the pricier side  i had a watermelon juic with my lox and bagel and it fetch me a pretti pricey bill consid noth i ate had to actual be cook or warm  

regardless the conveni of have a 24hour restaur doe work out nice when your drunk or tire from club and just need some food to soak up the booz  wish the wait staff had more person but hey id probabl be sick and tire of drunk and tourist toothe buffet itself isnt horribl but the servic is pretti bad 

came here on a sunday night and they were way understaf peopl were confus as to where to sit and the hostess didnt know which tabl were open out drink werent refil as the poor waitress was run around tri to take too mani tabl on 

food it is allright you obvious cant compar it to the bellagio or the wynn but it decent the garlic naan was so good it has to be good sinc it was actual made in those cool stone clay pan and made fresh right on the spot the shrimp is veri larg and fresh the crab lab werent bad 

dessert ok well you know it has to be good sinc it was design by pastri champion jeanphilipp mauri i liter tri everyth not too sweet and not too decad 

i realli onli came here cuz i had food credit from aria i guess it not bad for the price i believ it was around 2700 for dinner per personwith all of the buffet on the strip there isnt a lack of destin to choos from  howev consid how much i like aria i figur that their buffet would have to be on my list of spot to check out  after all if their buffet can match the hotel then it must be pretti decent right  so after check out their menu and be decent satisfi some of my friend and i end up come on a thursday night to give them a shot  

after pay and make our way in i alreadi start to get an omin feel though  now i dont know about youbut i general get worri when i start have doubt befor i even make it to my seat  whi so worri  well although the spacious of the dine area might have had someth to do with it the buffet seem pretti empti to me  though i didnt expect it to be a madhous like how it is at some asian buffet i figur there would at least be a steadi stream of peopl shuttl back and forth between the food and their tabl  in this case not so much   refresh as it was to be abl to reach for the serv utensil without someon right on my ass wait for me to finish it made me wonder if all those miss peopl knew someth i didnt  

like most vega buffet they have a decent varieti of select to cover just about everi diner that should pass through the place  from the usual buffet stapl to asian select to mexican food they cover a lot of territori  the question isnt so much what you want but what is worth eat  like your choic the qualiti vari as well  for the most part the food is fine  noth terribl but noth that drive you back up there for second or third  the mexican food was pretti bad though i like the chip and guacamolesalsa bar  then again at a vega buffet that probabl not the sort of thing you want to be chase  

among the few thing that were of note i thought that the prime rib was better than averag for a buffet  the season on the outsid was pretti good and it was still juici and tender  the star though if your a fan is the fresh crab leg they have  havent seen all of the buffet in vega but it one of the few that i recal see crab leg at and it certain the best that come to mind  they were veri fresh and tast great and it alway handi when they slice it all the way through so it easier to pick the meat out  hassl free crab leg  sign me up please

al in all the buffet isnt terribl and it definit worth check out if you like crab leg  just that in vega with so mani other choic relat close your probabl better off head over to cosmopolitan or wynni will start off by say 84 for two sunday brunch buffet and bottomless mimosa holi shit  we were told about the brunch by a good friend so we thought that wed wait until sunday befor we left to indulg we had check out brunch price on friday but didnt realiz that there was such a signific price differ between friday brunch and sunday  i am will to pay a good amount for bottomless mimosa but the bottomless mimosa were onli 6 each  two brunch buffet 72  wow shame on me for pay that  what i will say is that we made sure to get our moni worth of that buffet and those mimosas
th buffet was well stock but noth too irresist  they had a littl of everyth an omelet bar a brunch stapl pancak waffl and french toast all the egg bacon and sausag one could ask for  the buffet had a salad bar a littl mexican food a littl chines food some sushi and a touch of italian  the dessert bar was adorn with beauti confect and various type of gelato  the real star of the show were the crab leg  mound high like fresh pick corn at a farmer market the crab was plenti  serv with drawn butter and lemon wedg it was chill and delici  the onli thing lack a littl crab fork
our plate were clear quick and our server was friend and generous with the mimosa refil  we ate our weight in crab leg and drank as mani mimosa as we could put away  a solid 3 12 star is what id give the buffet  i may be back some dayi was at the aria buffet in it first incarn and i like it a lot  i was surpris when some trash it so much so i was glad when mgm resort announc they were close the buffet and redo it  yesterday i had the chanc to tri it sinc the redo

it basic the same place with a few modest chang and perhap the addit of a few station  first the goodth prime rib was cook nice with it be a nice red rare  the veget korma in the tandoori section was quit good  the chicken tikka masala was ok but it need more spice  the seafood gumbo was quit nice  i wish i had notic the basmati rice in the tandoori section first  i would have put some rice in the bowl and then ad the gumbo  the chees bar was veri nice with some dri fruit with the chees  the dessert were outstanding

a few lesser dish  the bao sandwich was not good at all  the love steam roll had dri hard from sit warm for howev long it was there  the pork in the bun was kind of bland make this a fail choic  there were some differ bread select but not a wide rang to choos from  the chicken satay was mere ok  the peanut sauc was way too runni and didnt have a lot of flavor  when your pay 3674 for dinner buffet the shrimp should be peel  i didnt have ani becaus this is an oner task for me

now the dessert  while there was noth exot or earth shake they had some veri nice small dessert  im a sucker for meringu cooki and they had a fruit flavor one  it was delight  i also had two of their mini whoopi cookieson a snowbal chocol cake with coconut and one made from red velvet  the cream fill was veri good  the gelato select is good and i had the oreo gelato  nice and creamy

thi isnt a buffet to which id like return  for the price there are better buffet on the strip with some veri good select  also for the price i think id pay a littl more and eat at one of aria fine select of restauraok is what scarpetta was i was veri excit to final tast the famous pasta from the man himselfscott conant i have been watch chop for week and was curious what exact doe he think amaz pasta is well scott mayb pasta is the onli thing you should stick to

w have order the hamachi tuna polenta foie gras ravioli black cod and the tast menu

let start from the begin first of all i would like to say that the servic was beyond repar we sat at the restaur for almost 3 hour it took the server to give us the menu for about half an hour and everi time we look for him he wasnt there after hint and hint that we would like our food right away the longer it took to the point where we just left

her is the breakdown

hamachi noth specialnobu beat this dish ani day of the week

tuna susci if you think wrap tuna over a bunch of carrot is creativethink again

polenta i realli enjoy this dish it came in a small pot with a mushroom sauc on the side this was one of my favorit appetizers

black cod it was aok i wish it had more flavor and was more moist i guess beggar cant be chooser 

duck and foie gras ravioli the dough was chewi and hard the sauc on top ruin the whole dish in my opinion the insid was tender and rich i think if the ravioli were smaller and more tender it would come togeth better

tast menu

fritto misto aok i like anchovi but i dont think this dish brought anyth special to the table

spaghetti with tomato and basil was the best dish of the night it was tender flavor and tasti i would have this again ani day

dessert the chocol cake was dri and even with the gelato on the side it still left a bitter rough flavor in my mouth

w tri a few other thing which i dont even care to discuss on the tast menu

th bread basket was also pretti amaz it came with 3 sauc which we order a second round of

overal i am not impress by this italian restaur this has noth to do with price or the atmospher i think as a food critic what you look at is the fresh of the food and the servic i have seen a lot of bad servic but ignor your patron will not bring you veri far

so scott conant i am give you a c you have been chophave heard about hakkasan from friend in london and hong kong i was excit to dine at the restaur with my friend as a vegetarian i was impress not onli by the larg varieti of vegetarian option at the restaur but also by the relat authent flavor of the dish without doubt hakkasan is a restaur that is friend to both vegetarian and carnivor 

all my friend agre the soup in hakkasan are authent and well execut and they high recommend the soup to yelper their favorit are chicken soup and the lobster soup the former compos of red date black chicken and sever chines medicin ingredi accord to one of my friend she never had this soup outsid of china and was impress by hakkasan effort in creat this dish anoth friend of mine also great enjoy the lobster soup which had lobster tofu and mushroom in her perspect the mushroom enhanc the flavor while the tofu complex the textur 

for vegetarian yelper i recommend the mushroom lettuc wrap which is a refresh altern to the tofu lettuc wrap while the pine nut increas the textur of the dish i suggest the chef increas the ratio of mushroom to pine nut in order to further enhanc the flavor i appreci the waitress prompt refil the lettuc for me 

the vegetarian dim sum platter is a beauti decor dish that i would suggest share amongst friend although each dim sum was well execut it tast veri similar to each other all the dim sum were main compos of mushroom and use similar sauc i recommend the chef increas the varieti of ingredi and sauc for the dim sum platter 

while my friend and i great enjoy the food at hakkasan we recommend the manag to provid more train to the waitress our waitress was attent but she did not seem to know the menu well and ask my friend repeat where she saw fresh lemonad as a drink as the lemonad was advertis as fresh i hope hakkasan will provid fresh juic instead of the sparkl lemonad in the futur 

i recommend hakkasan to friend and coupl who are look for a chines restaur with wellexecut food and a hip vibe

tip for yelpers
you can stop by the recept of the restaur to make reserv throughout the day if you are not abl to reach the hostess via phoneive been to other asian restaur on the strip and they have one or more of the follow issu low qualiti food sad excus for portion andor overpr dish  it odd to say but fortun hakkasan onli suffer from that third one

th interior is realli one gigant space but seem like a big labyrinth with multipl room and hall due to the tall partit set up throughout  there are mani dine tabl and a bar tuck away in the back  some drink were creativ other were easili avail elsewher but theyll all run you 1520 each

th menu has mani appet side and entre to choos from as well as a few tast menus avail which requir four peopl in your parti to order  for a parti of six we order four tast menus and a few other dish to round out our meal  for a set menu that is meant for four it come with a surpris amount of food that easili fill up the six of us  noth was disappoint but the standout for me were the crispi duck salad they do not skimp on the portion here if you enjoy duck get this dish duck with truffl oil again good portion and the wagyu beef stir fry

th food was well prepar in generous portion and left all of us feel satisfi  the part that make hakkasan hard to recommend is the price  the tast menu we order was 118 per person and most dish are 30 each  total for our meal was over 1000 which is ridicul for six peopl eat chines food  fortun and the main reason we came we were abl to enjoy a promot that got us 50 off our entir bill  in the end it was around 80 per person which is much more reason but arguabl still a lot

th price at hakkasan make it hard place to wholeheart recommend but unlik other asian restaur on the strip youll actual end up with a good meal if you decid to spend the money herei was lure in by a sampl of youngberri tea so refresh and i want some more  

the sale woman gave me a sampl of all the tea they had brew and a tour around the shop  she was friend and knowledg about the product in the store  a pleasur to speak with  when it came time to buy she did her veri best to sell me everi tea product in the store  i stay the cours though and insist i onli want some tea  she grab a larg canist and start fill it up with tea and i had to stop her and explain there was no way i need that much tea  she then grab a smaller canist and start fill it up even the small canist seem like it would last me a year  she put it on the scale and it rang up to 50 for tea  again i stop her and told her that was way too much to spend on tea and she remov the tea from the canist and put some into paper bag  

it realli bother me that she had taken the liberti to fill up that first larg canist of tea who know what that would have cost  the teavana staff must know their product are expens and i would have prefer it if she would have ask me beforehand how much tea i need or how much i want to spend see as how there werent price on tea or at least none that i could see  i understand that they are tri to make money and up sell but ask dont take libertistay strong yelper have a game plan befor you go into the store and dont let the sale associ smell your fear they can sens weak they will twist and turn you around until next thing you know you have spent far too much on tea than you even thought was possibl 

rememb know what you want onli that and get out as fast as you canok the food here isnt the best but i dont think it bad if your crave chines food dont want panda express and dont want to drive all the way to china town  it doe the job

th price are decent and they liter make your carri out order in 5 minutes

som dish i recommend
mongolian beef
won ton soup
salt and pepper pork
fri rice ani kind

bewar of the chow mein if your look for the pan fri noodl type  it pretti much lo mein and i was disappoint when i order it last time we went

dont forget the carri out order coupon  i think they have free egg roll with purchas over 20 and free fri rice with purchas over 30 three point six seven nine stars

i have some gift card from carrabba and i must say that even though i am fair antichain and proindependentcarrabba aint half bad  as a matter of fact it better than half good

th servic here was outstand and the food was well beyond just ok  better than i was expect from a chain

w order sever thing to share amongst the famili  spaghetti with meatbal chicken caeser salad mozzarella stick  i particular enjoy the chicken caesar salad

i still prefer independ but carrabba is a safe chain appar  i think35 star if you are look for super cheap eat along old town after check out all the shop etc this is a place to come we got enough buy one get one free of lesser or equal valu card from the farmer market and got an incred good deal 

our grill chees sammich with onion ring french fri were decent the texa burger was well like despit the name someon in our yelper group who shall remain anonym said it was more of a western burger than a texa burger and our littl mini yelper in train like her hot dog servic is averag and the food quantiti is worth the price  

a cheap find if you have the mini coupon card or a decent valu without the couponthink johnni rocket but with the abil to also order a burrito or waffl with your burger  eclect menu for the eclect part of scottsdal  also good valu35

while im almost a fan i should have paid better attent to the name of the restaur when order  had it been julio mexican food  other stuff my order would have been a wise choic  but instead i order a carn asada quesadilla made by david who special in hamburgers

in all fair to david it was not bad  im not a big quesadilla person but the mexican plate seem to larg for me to consum and expect to walk around the art festiv afterward  and if i cant take it home im inclin to stuff it down  i didnt care for the meat in the quesadilla not the season but the actual flavor of the meat itself was odd but it was perfect butteri and toasti and full of chees and veggi as well  my husband hamburg howev look great and i was full of envi as i watch him finish it in record time  that envi quick turn to resent as he sampl my quesadilla and remark yep mine better  he would pay for his insensit later that afternoon  i like that they will add flavor to your soft drink but my cherri coke need more cherri flavor and the addit of a cherri would be nice

i do love that this restaur has not be redesign to fit into the trend of turn old town into north scottsdal from the big counter on one side to the vinyl booth on the other  i just think ill still with burger and shake  well who am i kid  ill order david mexican food again  i cant turn down anyth in a tortillawalk in seat yourself  beer price incred high it is inde 8 for a guin  they offer pbr  pbr at an upscal restaur for 4  this is a fair signific fail simpli given the fact that ive never seen such swill at those price offer at a place like this  there was stella and hoegaarden offer as well but at 7 who want that  we should have immedi abandon all hope of order beer and turn to the fair impressivelook wine select but no one in my parti was inclin to do so  so that was the first disappoint  miller high life and other domest do not merit 5  i honest wonder whether this was an intent choic aim at ad a touch of ironi to the menu but final must simpli conclud that theyr attempt to drive peopl to the wine list  

the burger option there are three predesign burger none of which quit seem to call out to me and one yellowfin tuna sandwich count among the burger  i elect to build my own  13 differ chees are name and a brief descript is provid along with the sourc  refer to the menu if your confus  i thought this was an excel touch  there are extra ie bacon toast tomato etc and sauc ranch garlic aoli bbq so on that can also be ad  i opt for a simpl combin of midnight moon chees and jalapeno bacon  i didnt say it was a good combin i said it was relat simpl  they offer a side of 1000 island dress with ani burger along with basic lettuc tomato pickl and onion accord to your prefer  i order mine rare  our tabl of 4 also order 2 order of sweet potato fri 4 which were good  the burger emerg not long thereaft  mine was medium or medium well onli a littl pink toward the side  this was the other disappoint of the even  uneven cook and cook far beyond my order i was more than a littl let down given that their name suppos refer to the specif temperatur differ between a medium rare and a well done burger thank the burger was still juici enough that i wasnt forc to appli load of ketchup or resort to the dress  the chees was excel mild and the jalapeno bacon was quit tasti as well  the bun use is a veri fluffi white bread which combin with the thick patti to make the whole packag rather intimid when it first brought out  i did thorough enjoy the burger despit the goofup with the cook  i didnt check to see how my companion burger were cook but they claim to enjoy their as well

 anoth note we ask our waitress about the beef use and she did not answer with confid inform us that the beef was 100 ground sirloin 100 grainf beef  i kind of assum a burger place like this would consid the beef a sell point but she hem and haw a bit seem onli too glad to move on with the convers as soon as her question curios abat  she didnt have to prove anyth about the beef to ani of us i dont think we were expect realli lowqual meat but she could have been a slight more enthusiast salesperson in my opinion  it look like lack of train  

the decor is eclect but veri upscal on the insid the patio where we sat was pretti plain  the servic was realli good  other than the brief descript of the beef i have no other complaint for our server  

there noth wrong with this place in fact despit my littl disappoint we all enjoy our meal veri much  a few fair small adjust and id easili award this place 5 star  but this beer select in this day and age where beer drink is no longer vilifi even among higherend restaur is an absolut joke  mani diner will be even more incens at the failur to prepar the burger correct  i felt that the juici of the burger at least partial redeem this error  perhap those that prefer their burger medium to medium well will be less dissatisfi  ill almost certain be back and id be glad to see these issu resolv on futur visit  this place is too nice to not have substanc to match the flashtypic bar  grill type fare but here you will be entertainedmystifi by a neverend rotat slideshow of imag of the great sammi hagar from his solo day to van halen to his slow melt into obscur lend his name to generic restaur around the globe guy fieristyl  burger wing sandwich quesadilla  the sole salad choic is of the southwestern chicken varieti  vega hangov food while you wait for your flight and noth more  the servic is decent and they have a full bar
mi travel mate had a bloodi mari and i enjoy a mimosa i did not enjoy drop 30 for those two itemwe all have our bad day whether we wake up on the wrong side of the bed or some event turn our mood we have them now how you choos to react to them that is what make the differ you can have a bad day but make a conscious choic to minim it forc a smile and make it work after a while and mayb a few cup of coffe the day can smooth over if you let it 

i know this sound so trivial what could this possibl have to do with food well in life and the restaur biz you realli have to make an impress when the person take your order is grumpi mayb a littl bitchi even no matter how good the food is it may never live up to it full potenti 

unfortun this is what happen on a recent visit to sonora mesquit grill when the guy at the counter couldnt even muster up a hello but simpli yes now i would have blown this off if he hadnt been joke around with the peopl in front of me in line it just this sort of thing that just chap my behind realli how hard would it have been to crack a smile and save me from have to share this i persever take the high road and get my order start becaus ive been hear some realli god thing about this place 

the buzz surround sonora is it self proclaim best carn asada this side of the border which is a pretti tall order when it come to carn asada think about it we have so mani place that serv good carn asada around town even the berto drive thrus dont realli suck that bad if youv never heard of carn asada it thin slice beef that has been marin or heavili salt then grill or roast to a caramel perfect then wrap all that up into a hot flour tortilla with pico de gallo chop onion cilantro and tomato and fresh guacamol trust me on this youll love it 

green chile raja with chees 625 was an excel way to make up for the lack of friendli a juxtaposit of roast chile onion and pepper serv with either corn or flour tortilla pop with flavor and textur i would strong recommend the flour tortilla so light and flaki characterist not common with the usual breadi type 

okay so get to the carn asada burrito 749 youll first notic the price tag a bit high consid that the burrito while larg is also stuf with rice for me if im go to pay that much for a burrito it need to be more meat and less filler now with that be said the meat insid the burrito was not onli perfect cook it was amaz the first bite fill your mouth with a certain salti beefi mesquit smoki that both flavor and satisfi the onli thing that made the meat better was the addit of sonora killer hous made guacamol 150 green salsa and red salsa both salsa were delici though neither offer ani sort of heat 

i love eat the food from smg i can onli imagin how much better it would have been if the servic came with a smilethis is an awljsso everyth tast fishi  friedjk

real it a pretti good fast food burger  hotdog but the fri stuff is just too greasi  heavi for me

i jump on the 90 papa burger on father day  this is one of the best bargain you will ever find at a fast food joint

i still hang on to the memori of yesteryear when aw was just like sonic with the roller waitress and driveup order unfortun the food is no where near the same as it use to be

just too damn fastmmmmmm soooo good i was suck my spoon silly


2011 entertain guid buy one get one coupons

i like it a lotfollow the yelp review for vietnames food in vega and head to da lat we order the bbq pork and shrimp wrap veggi pho bun bo hue hainan chicken and the beef carpaccio salad 

the place is small and locat in a strip mall plenti of park we got there around 1145 am and when we finish the place had peopl wait 

the raw beef salad was the highlight of the meal good portion and flavor

hainan chicken was the worst i have ever had dri and premad then reheat 

the veggi pho was ok veggi were imit crab meat broccoli carrot and cabbage

th bun bo hue was bland but had lot of top such as slice beef blood cake pork hock and noodl 

bbq pork and shrimp wrap were veri flavor and goe well with the lettuc leaf wrap

ic vietnames coffe was smooth and creamy

servic was good and the food was just oki went here onc befor my yelp day and never went back but groupon had a deal for 8 for 16 and the budget savvi person in me just could not resist

so i went and told them i had a groupon they ask me for the coupon and no issu at all it was one waiter in the place and he was actual veri on top of his job he made sure that i was do okay and had everyth i need 

howev i just wasnt feel the place i was quick remind onc i start eat whi i never came back

speci combo pho with extra tendon  the noodl were just too soft way too soft i felt like they were extra soft for a child or senior citizen that is the best way i can explain it the broth wasnt bad  but it just had this flavor to it that i wasnt fond of 

papaya salad   i dont know what i was expect but this wasnt it it was just plain shred papaya mix with shred carrot and slice shrimp they serv it with shrimp cracker and the server just told me to use the fish sauc at the tabl but i wasnt sure how to use the nuoc cham with it so i never finish it i did eat the shrimp cracker though

pork sausag patti roll  probabl the best thing i ate or mayb not the sausag look a littl under cook other than that it was pretti tasti 

so in the end i realli want to give this place a two but it wasnt horribl i just didnt care for it so this should be like a 25

it a pretti small place so if you come with a big group it just might be a littl crowd the restroom is back in the kitchen just a littl uncomfort for meim pretti conflict about this place i have want to check them out for a while but never got a chanc until they recent offer a groupon 

we arriv around 5pm on a sunday and the place was empti we decid to sit out on the patio to enjoy the nice weather and extend daylight did to the time chang luckili they had happi hour so we opt to stick to the tapa and discount martini 5 for ani martini seem like a great deal and they have over 500 to choos from we also order some messi fri stuf oliv and a pizza to share the stuf oliv were nice wrap in bacon and stuf with chees the pizza was ok a littl undercook and came out a littl on the lukewarm side which wasnt veri appet the fig ad a nice flavor but a littl more time in the oven would have help the textur and flavor the messi fri were the highlight of the meal fri slather in buffalo sauc and mix with bleu chees they were spici and drip  with sauc and yet maintain their nice crunchi textur the martini were ok i order the blackberri and my fella got the strawberri shortcak there were so mani option i found it difficult to narrow down what i want ill definit have to take more time to research next time i come 

overal our meal was nice but noth was amaz and sinc we didnt order meal i cant speak too much to the regular menu 

our server was extrem attent almost too much at time but we appreci his effort sinc we were outsid and he didnt want us to think he forgot about us at ani point 

more peopl trickl in around 6pm so hope they do get more peopl than we saw dure our meal i would be interest in come back for happi hour again 5 martini are a great deal and id like come back for that alonprior to sunnyslop art walk i decid a drink was in order  after all what the point of walk without drink  otherwis i would be drive the art walk and then they would have to chang the name to art drive and no one would go  so central grill with it generous park fit the bill

w sat on the patio which is quit nice onc the tabl with the scream brat exit  by then i realli need that drink  they have a great happi hour with 5 glass of hous wine 350 well drink and import or draft beer  the hous wine were not appeal to me but all of their wine price are quit reason although the bytheglass select is limited

w order two appet at onli 5 each  howev they were small so definit order more than one unless your the girl that never eat in front of your guy  im not that girl  we had the artisan chees plate and the fig jam crostini  the chees plate includ a blue chees a goat chees and a third soft chees some kind of cream chees  the cranberrywalnut bread was a nice touch even if the chees were somewhat ordinari  the fig jam crostini was so crazi delici though with carmel onion and melt gorgonzola as well

mi husband want dinner but sinc i didnt think there would be sofa along the art walk we opt to have onli an entre no side dish  i went with the stuf salmon  the stuf was made with crab meat  unfortun the salmon was undercook around the stuf  had i been rest after dinner instead of walk i might have actual sent it back someth i rare do

th happi hour portion of servic was actual a littl slow consid the restaur was pretti empti when we arriv but our server was friend  all in all an enjoy timeomfg this place is loud  fifw consid bring earplugs

pert and perki servic with a smile the two time ive been here fyi

food is okey dokey neighbor

pric are fair ta middlin for the burger joint grub

thi place is awash with hard surfaceseven the ceil tile  henc the loud music and other hubbub careen around and leav you with ring earsula bbq buffet in the maci home shop center right on spring mountain has join the ayc korean bbq craze  weve watch for month as the sign illumin their exist but wait for the door to actual open 

last weekend the husband a friend and i final decid to see what the fuss was all about  we sat down a littl after 7 pm and each took a look at the spread befor us

ther seem to be a good amount of banchan to choos from includ white rice and purpl rice  quit a select of meat to choos from as well  their cook item were okay  rang from dumpl fish and tempura  their dessert select though is someth to cri about  jello can peach fresh watermelon and honeydew old sesam ball and deepfri pineappl chunks

pric for adult on weekend 1995

i do have to agre with other comment regard the staff hound you  the manag would come by our tabl all the time we were seat close to the regist and take a survey of the restaur  it made me wonder if they were watch how much we were eat  at one point the waitress put the bill on our tabl and i was a bit shock  i said is there a time limit under my breath but she then told us to take our time  take our time eat or take our time pay the bill  either way get your bill dure our meal is a bad sign  dont do it  and yes we also experi the older korean owner too  i guess i said someth out loud about not have ani lettuc and a littl green salad show up at my tabl  weird  

servic is okay  drink come immedi and they also help with cook your meat too  our grill got clean onc while we ate which look super easi becaus she just wipe it with a paper towel

overal sula bbq buffet was okay i think there a bigger select over at woo che and it cheaper there toobeen here at least 4 time alreadi so yeah a review should be done so here it is 

first off if you are a carnivor like i am then this is the place for your all you can eat ayc meat crave they have plenti of option like beef bulgogi spici pork belli thin slice brisket and cow tongu for dinner they have the good stuff like short rib and small thick cut of ribey 

not a meat lover well they do have sushi a salad bar and a separ section of hot item like fri rice tempura and steam fish just to mention a few

if this is your first time the rule are simpl get food that you like whether it alreadi cook or not and sit down start eat cook item while you are wait for raw item to get done cook the server take away your dirti dish and refil your drink that it if you dont like how your the item you cook tast then you have nobodi to blame but yourself

thi is my rule of thumb alway tri to sampl some of everyth and then decid what you like the best and knock yourself out alway get your money worth even better when you have been here befor becaus you should alreadi know what you like

servic is hit or miss one visit i bare saw my server so i did not get much refil and we had dish all pile up at the edg of the tabl which was obvious our server was lack anoth visit our server was check up on us like everi minut which was awesom 

the hour here are pretti good they are open from 11 am to 3 am everi day also take note of the price lunch is usual a littl bit cheaper becaus there are some item that are onli avail dure dinner which in turn mean that the dinner price are more expens refer to my pic for full detail on pricing

som random info dont wear nice cloth when eat here you will get greas that splatter from the grill on to your cloth not to mention the barbequ smell tri go to ani semi formal event after eat here and you will get peopl crave korean barbequ as soon as they smell you lol they have sever flat panel lcds so if the big game is go on they are more than like will have it play make sure to eat most of the food you brought to your tabl or they will charg you extra

last the 3 star is main for the price and qualiti sever year ago i rememb dinner price use to be around 20 buck they also use to have raw mussel and shrimp as well but now those are gone this last time i went it was about 27 buck a person without drink i can understand the price hike so that they can make money but take stuff away while increas price is no bueno if you ask me

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 147 vegetarian need not appliummmmmmm not the best thing that has ever happen to me but fun for a girl night out  i would not recommend this place for a date it seem to be better for group and hoes

yeah definit group and hoes

i have never tri the food here
ever

thi last time there was no cover sinc a buddi did the happi hour rout which is if you have like 8 peopl total give them your name and guarante those peopl will be there they will give you a host bracelet and free drink coupon and the rest of your group will get bracelet which give them 2 well drink and 2 beer noth fanci so youv got to like bud light

it is right across from this countri theme bar with a mechan bull so that a fun distract for a while but it not like either of these place are vegasclass or anything

additionally

do not drink and drive
lik ever
but especi from this place there are cop everywhere
cop stand right outsid the door look for the drunki cop car park all over the park lot

dont be afraid to get into the passeng seat of your car toss those key into the backseat and take a niiic looonnng nap until your sober or someon come to pick you up


enjoythis one is pretti simpl onli good to grab a drink maaaaaaaayb two befor a game and move onwe went yesterday after go to the movi and see an ad in the theater for a free scoop of ice cream with cupcakecakepop purchas and ticket stub when the movi got out there was still 20 minut befor they close so we hurri over i got the vanillavanilla buttercream oh it was fabul my sister got the chocolatevanilla buttercream also wonderful

so whi onli 3 star you may ask if youv read some of the other review youll see there is a bit of a custom servic problem at this locat the gal behind the counter had no energi and i felt like we were bother her i had never been befor so i want to know what  they had this realli put her out but she was resign to her fate that we were not go anywher until we got some answer she ask if we want the cupcak to go and we did not there was still around 15 minut befor the shop was go to close and she was not pleas that we were not leav right away

sh was also a veri poor salesperson while we were eat a coupl came in to ask about a specialti cake sound like it was for some type of event which i was hear could get pricey a good busi for the store they were ask question and she was bare give them the minimum answer if i were the owner of this busi i would ensur i had energet salespeopl not just someon who was punch a timecard and couldnt wait to leav at the end of the shift i would not be surpris if they decid to go somewher els with the lack of help they got 

 there was anoth person a guy who work there who had been in the back when we came in he help a coupl of peopl after us and he was so much better energet friend great peopl person had he been the one to help us i would have given it 4 star i will definit go back for the cake mayb to go next timewent friday to take advantag of the special lechon roast pig    
i found the cafe cozi nice dark wood furnitur and dark wood blind  definit more welcom than the restaur in chandler  i found the high counter a littl daunt i be onli 5 feet tall had to either hoist myself up on the counter with my elbow to peer down or had to crouch down to have a look under the counter and have a look through the sneezeguard  their label system need improv i vote for adhes label that go on the sneezeguard so that patron can easili identifi the food on the buffet line  im sorri but no matter how often karey and purin say they like to cook the food to order food laid out in huge tray and place in turoturo style isnt food cookedtoorder

her is a list of the food i tri that day

1 lechon larg order 699 includ corn tortilla i sub flour and  choic of spanish or filipino garlic rice  i chose filipino of cours httpwwwyelpcombizphotoskareyskitchenphoenixselectshzjnbydlpa74ndjqh2xgshzjnbydlpa74ndjqh2xg

2 3entre combo of dinuguan chocol stew beef mechado and pork adobo  includ garlic rice  httpwwwyelpcombizphotoskareyskitchenphoenixselectpcxd22brq9ixjgm13149fqpcxd22brq9ixjgm13149fq

3 lumpia shanghai fri filipino pork eggrol small order includ 8 pcs of pork and onionfil minieggrol that are fri  httpwwwyelpcombizphotoskareyskitchenphoenixselecthyjx4evw0ogej34rgcptkqhyjx4evw0ogej34rgcptkq

4 halohalo 450 frozen dessert consist of sweet bean coconut string coco jelli ube tarobas pud coconut milk choic of ice cream and shave ice  httpwwwyelpcombizphotoskareyskitchenphoenixselectcphmbwm29bpkoabidq9qcacphmbwm29bpkoabidq9qca

5 pan of cassava 8 cassava is a root much like a sweet potato or yam that is pound or ground into flour and then mix with cream butter eggyolk and sugar and bakedsteam into a cakelik dessert dish  somewhat cakey and much thicker than an eggcustard pie a littl help here joel  

6  togo contain of pork adobo and dinuguan each 3

i found all the entre and eggrol save the mechado meat was a littl tough veri tender and veri tasti love the dinuguan  howev theyr all veri greasi unfortun  ill never ever order the fri eggrol again everytim i ate them they came back to haunt me and all due to the high greas and salt content  a cowork came for her first visit with her husband and stepdaught as well after i had left and told me that she found the eggrol veri salti as well as the other dish she tri there but couldnt bring herself to tell the owner becaus they were all so veri friend and sweet  karen rey and purin as well as michael were all veri friend and accomod this is true

i would order the dinuguan and pork adobo again but i wont eat ani of it until im abl to place them in the fridg so that their sauc may gel up and i can skim off the huge amount of fat reheat and then place them back into the fridg again so that i may reskim the fat one more time  onli then would i be abl to enjoy these dish  they are veri tasti but i have to be care  or i could enjoy them fresh but without much of the sauce

what my cowork and i definit agre on was that wed both come back just to have the halohalo again  this dessert similar to the vietnames che ba mau tast like it was made from fresh ingredi instead of from a bottl mix of bean coco string and jello  i like the ice cream they use too  you have your choic of either ube vanilla or mango  ill definit have to come back and tri a bowl of the two filipino flavor  as a special karen had prepar ginataan a warm dessert consist of plantain jackfruit coco string taro and someth akin to yam cook in coconut milk and sugar  this look and smell so veri good but i couldnt tri it due to food allergi  i wonder if joel had a sampl  i know he enjoy the cassava i did likewise

a for the lechon im sad to report that the skin wasnt crispi at all and i detect a chemic flavor everi time i tri the skin  it tast much like what a disinfect might tast like  a faint hint but still there nonetheless  the pork meat didnt wow me either  a big part of the enjoy of lechon is the mang toma lechon sauc which you can buy at lee lee supermarket in chandler or at mekong in mesa  awesom sauc just ask joel  ill have to tri the leftov lechon soon with the sauc i stay away from it bec i wasnt sure of the ingredi at the time

i will definit be back to tri their daili special  i do hope that karen and the other strive to lessen the greas content of their dishif you want your brain to explod just do a yelp search for yogurt in the phoenix metro area holi shit when did yogurt get so popular have i been live under a rock or something

yogurtland
yogurtlicious
yogurt builderz
yogurtology
yogurtini
mojo yogurt
yogurberry

thes are all real place and i could keep go here and make this review way too long if i want to weve been to a few of these place recent and theyr all pretti good but to be honest if you blind fold me and made me tri to distinguish one from the other there no way i could do it 

the idea behind these yogurt store get a solid four star yet yogurt place like yogurtland are gonna stay at about three and a half becaus theyr all so much like each other will one particular yogurt place make a move to stand out from the other im on the edg of my seat to find out i just hope peopl dont get tire of yogurt anytim soon becaus if they do were gonna have a lot of angri unemploy yogurtpeopl to answer to 

i still love the fact that they charg by weight and that it quit a bit healthier than ice cream without sacrif tast yogurtland has quit a few winner in the flavor depart a few of their variat we love were peanut butter and irish mint creme not bad at all

355

p yogurt in az  big time market saturationjust sayinwe came here becaus my daughter school was have a fund raiser  i alway like to support the school and im a fan of fro yo so we went  i like the fact that they put some of the top on the bottom of the cup befor they put the yogurt in the cup  this is not self serv  the portion are generous and not too expens  i have sinc been back a few time  they have a frequent buyer card and tuesday is two stamp tuesday  i like their old fashion vanilla and the cake batter was ok  their fruit flavor were just meh  all in all the place has been pretti clean when we have been in so that a plus in my book  it not the best ive ever had but it not bad either  and my card is almost full  i may bump this place up to 4 star on my next visit  the present was veri good the food smell great the servic was veri good

mi critic are that the mix grill was most overdon  not so much that it was bad it was veri flavor  but the shrimp was chewi and the lamb was overdon as well

th garlic naan was awesom  the chicken tikka was veri flavor and was veri differ than other place ive had it

th portion on the naan was great less so on the tikka and the mix grill

th place has a nice open layout and featur accent of broken plate work into the column and other areathis place was ok it was recommend to us from a friend who know authent mexican cuisin when you first arriv they bring you out chip and 3 differ type of salsa green spici red and pico de gallo they are all pretti good i order the chees enchilada and asada taco combo and it was ok i realli like the enchilada sauc it definit not your can version in most restaur around here the taco werent the best the beef seem kind of dri although the tortilla were homemade
warn this place onli give you one free drink refil befor they charg you for anoth drink and it like 225 or somethingweird they also onli give you one chip refil befor they charg you 199 and they dont give a lot of chip35 stars

aft we went to the movi it was dinner time so we went across the street to la parilla suiza  we were greet and seat and then about 10 min went by befor our server came to take a drink order  chip and salsa had been place on the tabl but no water or drink order taken  our server did not seem all that enthusiast  she seem as though she was just go through the motion  i told her it was our fist time there so she point out some hous specialti and then went to get out drink  i saw they had chilequil on the menu and i love them and not mani place serv them  when i place my order our server seem a bit supris i didnt order one of the higher price specialti  our food arriv and it was hot and the chilequil were good  we were never offer more chip and onli check on onc dure the meal  the food was fine but the servic was lack in my opinion  if i was in the area again i would go back and give them anoth chanc  everyon is entitl to a bad daynew to the neighborhood this place just reloc from n las vega to the old cappazolli build  maryland pkwye desert inn rd just 2 month ago

it kinda hidden in the back but they have a street sign to catch your eye

it a small takeout place there is 34 tabl but no tv or music or ani reason to realli hang out  eat they have menus everywher with all kind of specials

obvi the special that caught my eye was the 5 item for 5 piec of chickenleg or wingfishcatfish or snapper  ribbeef or pork plus fri and a drink 

the food

th chicken was greatwel seasonedcrispi not real greasi and real meaty
th fish was good it had a nice cornmeal bread season well and the fish was fresh  tasti but it hard to pleas me when it come to catfish
th rib were weakkinda dri  tough ton of saucewhich was good but no smoke flavor not my kinda rib
fri were fri kinda salti but good

overal great pricesgreat chicken good fish skip the rib give it a trygreat pricedid not live up to it hype

first off the good the servic was wonder and the wine they recommend was right up my alley my husband pork belli was amaz quit flavor and cook perfect he also rave about his foie gras

now the bad base on review of this place i foolish expect it to be cute the outsid is veri quaint with lot of  flower in pot cozi tabl and peopl watch but if you end up sit insid i know who doe that in az but it was chill outsideth place will remind you of an old taho log cabin and not in a good way the spark littl chandeli and a few gilt frame mirror do not a cute french cabin make insid seat itself is reminisc of your local pub dive bar where you are all shove togeth on long benches

enough about the decor the food to me was unimpress this place seem to be old school french not nouveau or anyth gastropubbish weird were talk snail and frite and foie gras french aint easi to do but i figur with the amount of fabul review that this place would know how to do it

wrong my mussel rest in tepid untasti broth my steak and frite meal a simpl classic that is a no brainer in a french restaur was appal the steak look like an overdon piec of mutton and the fri were season yesa in jack in the box cur fries

last the coffe was incred weak which was bizarr consid it was through a french press the onli save grace in the meal for me was that the dark and milk chocol creme brule dessert was so rich wonder i almost felt i could overlook the countless other way this place fell short almost

it was disappoint to have such a lukewarm experi given the fabul review here especi given it was our most expens meal in az possibl it was an off night for the chef who know my husband enjoy his meal and the experi itself was enjoy but it seem i made all the wrong select except for that rich luscious dessert 

next time ill just skip the meal part and go straight for the sweetyou know what remind me to write a review of lolo  

this convers 

sunday morn my friend say to me you look realli drunk at lolo last night 
me what do you mean
friend you were all red and splotchy
m so it wasnt the fact that i was eat fri chicken and a waffl at 3am that made me look drunk
friend hey we were all drunk you just have realli light skin and it shows

i have decid to not put lolo on the drunk late night eat rotat  it too bright in there and appar my swedish skin give my drunken away  also the floor is slipperi when wet and it was rain that night  i skid across the tile right in front of a polic offic  luckili i never drive when i plan on drink so it didnt realli matter 

i got the betti boop i think  it a fri juici breast and a waffl  i felt like the fri juici breast was a littl over fri  it wasnt bad but it wasnt good and let face it if food doesnt tast out of this world when your drunk it cant realli be that good in realiti  the waffl howev was delici  i dont know im not from the south and i was drunk so you probabl shouldnt take this review too seriousthis place is a blast from the pastiowatasm a drug store with a lunch counter plus a pharmaci  an attach bar

ther no wait just sit right up to th e counter and order they have a small simpl menu but good prices

w order a 2 egg breakfast and a philli chees steak

th servic was veri fast  friend but then again we were the onli customers

th food was good fresh  tasti mayb a littl greasi but i like greasi check the pic to see it

i would definit tri it again mayb the burger which is said to be their big winner herenot pacquiao vs mayweath but da vang vs pho thanh

servic     da vang 5 star vs pho thanh 3 stars
food         da vang 4 star vs pho thanh 35 stars
ambi da vang 3 star vs pho thanh 4 stars
pric         da vang 5 star vs pho thanh 5 stars
roa         da vang 4 star vs pho thanh 4 stars
ratio of authenticity

you be the judge

find this use cool or funni pleas check accordwe ate here on friday night  the food was good but our server and the locat suck ass

a soon as we pull into the park lot we got the last park spot in the whole lot we were accost by some crack out black dude look for a coupl of buck  we told him we had one dollar and he look annoy that we didnt have more  i scroung around in my purs for the dollar as he pepper my husband who was halfway in the car unbuckl the babi from her carseat with question about if we also had some chang we could give him too my husband repeat said no we had one dollar  after i slip the dollar to my husband he offer it to mr crack head who prompt snatch it up and start across the park lot to hit up the other peopl pull in and my husband was so piss that he didnt even have the decenc to say thank that he start yell after him about learn some manner  ugh   anyway we get insid and i have half a mind to complain to the restaur manag that they have someon outsid harass all their patron but the cold stare from the less than friend server we had a young vietnames dude with a neck tattoo dissuad me from attempt anyth more than give him my order number  i can understand that a young man in his midtwenti  probabl doesnt want to be work tabl in presum his famili restaur at 730 on a friday night and i can even imagin that mayb just mayb his english isnt that good but i kinda doubt it he was probabl born and rais in the us unlik the older man at the regist but i simpli cant understand whi he couldnt fake a smile for us and make us feel slight less like annoy and more like valu guest here to spend their hard cash and enjoy dinner     

okay rant over sorry

so we both order the beef pho with brisket and the food arriv within a blaze fast 5 minut  the soup was hot hearti and delici  no complaint there  at the same time we order the food we each also order the sweet young whole coconut for drink and unfortun it took anoth 10 minut for the coconut to arriv  but when they did arriv they were delicious

w were never check on after we had our food and our drink were drop off at our tabl but i guess that okay sinc we didnt need anyth els and we were abl to make due without our server cold stare and indiffer attitud  

anyway the food is fast cheap and delici  the bill was onli 16 for pho and coconut drink for 2 adult  you cant beat that price with a stick 

minus a star for the aw locat  minus a star for the crappi server  asid from that the food is worth brave the locat and service


i think that if the manag could tell neck tattoo to smile and pretend to be friend and to check on the guest at least onc itd do a lot to help with the custom servic perception


oh and mayb also invest in a secur guard to chase the panhandl crack head out of the park lot too  drive down rainbow all the time and we alway pass by nagoya 2  but leav it to an advertis sell their newest addit to the menu ayc korean bbq to have us come through their doors

onc you get pass the bore facad you walk into a larg restaur establish with a bar to the right sushi bar in the middl tabl to the left and bbq tabl on the further left

th husband want ayc korean bbq and there onli one way he can get it  if i order it with him  it offer to parti of two or more do ayc only

adult price 1995
kid price 8 year old and younger 1295

a littl banchan start your korean meal  korean pancak broccoli pickl cucumb and potato not much here

a the waitress was get our tabl set up i ask her if im suppos to go ahead and tell her what i want  she mention someth about them usual bring everyth out unless i have a prefer  we definit did have a prefer becaus we didnt quit want it all

ther are about seven differ appet to choos from we went with

 garlic edamam soy bean with spici garlic sauce
 gyoza deep fri dumpling
 chicken wing spici marinated

th kitchen list has about six item and we got

 tonkatsu deep fri bread pork
 veget tempura assort veget deep fried
 kake udon thick noodl soup with fri tofu fish cake seaweed
 fri rice vegetable

from the korean bbq list of four items

 galbi angus marin bbq beef ribs
 samgyubs pork belly
our waitress did all the cook for us here so that was nice

from the classic roll list of seven items

 salmon skin roll grill salmon skin
 spici tuna roll spici tuna cucumber

for dessert you get onli one scoop of vanilla or green tea ice cream

th staff realli didnt want our fellow diner to not do ayc with us but we told them otherwis  the mil and her companion chose to order off their regular japanes menu  they both had the combin dinner special which includ salad rice miso soup gyoza and two item from their list for 1350  it 1550 if you want three item  she went for the tonkatsu and miso saba while he went for the shrimp tempura and calamari tempura  howev we think he got the short end of the stick becaus there were onli two piec of shrimp and the rest were veggi  in retrospect he would have done the shrimp tempura entre dinner for 1290 and gotten 6 piec of shrimp instead  what a bummer  they also got what look like a half order of a ca roll with their meal

servic was good for the latter part  our initi waitress was a bit spacey until we move into the bbq section and then that waitress was better and a lot more friendlier  

it was onli a tuesday night but they had a steadi stream of custom  some sit at the tabl anoth sit at the ayc bbq section and more sit at the sushi bar  they have a pretti extens menu and the sushi menu is pretti long

overal it wasnt bad for ayc  sure weve had a better select for a fraction of the price but itll have to do for the southwest area for now  but for more bang for your buck your better off over on spring mountainyagyu has been on the radar for a good while sinc mani vega local have spot their yakiniku sign  appar they open up this week and philip t was so kind to remind us that it had final opened

it what i would call korean barbecu meet the finer end of japanes qualiti meat  yakiniku mean grill meat and it hard to separ the two from just regular good ole fashion korean bbq

i was pretti excit when i walk in the restaur  clean line larg tabl with exhaust chimney for grill and a thermomet announc the beer was 29 degrees

howev when i saw the menu i was disappoint  it was veri simpl and basic  i was a bit turn off  but sinc we were there alreadi i just had to tri it  the waitress also gave us two dip sauc  a japanes soy sauc with mirin and anoth one i cant remember

 pork toro 675  twelv piec of fatti pork sprinkl with salt and pepper  we threw them on the grill and yes they were amaz delici and fatty

 prime beef tongu 925  seven piec of fresh beef tongu and went quit nice with the lemon juic and sesam oilsalt concoction

 ribey 775  six or seven piec of beef along with three piec of veggi  also veri tasti and fresh

initi the price dont seem too bad  but i knew we were hungri and if were go to stick around the bill would have been cost  i thought we would be abl to enjoy a nice meati dinner but see the direct of the cost it look like it would be a pricey meat dinner  i dont realli like how everyth is a la cart  kimche garlic lettuc rice etc  with all the korean restaur in town you get use to get all that other stuff included

and like john hs friend our friend thought some of the waitress were cute but that his fever

servic was good a bit over effici this first week of busi  we had at least three differ girl ask if we were readi to order and we were not  i think they are just tri to be out there but it can get suffocating

th exhaust doesnt work that great becaus tear were well up from all the smoke come from our grill 

overal i think it would be good for a snack or light meal but not for a hearti meal with friendive never tri a mcrib sandwich and i heard via the talk thread that mcdonald in las vega start serv them the other day so i took my son here to give this legendari sandwich a try

w order two mcrib meal sandwich fri soda 419  i also want to tri the 1 spici mcchicken sandwich

th verdicti didnt like the mcrib at allblech  the sauc was the best part about it other than that it was pretti bland  the fri were good of courseand the spici mcchicken sandwich was decent not bad for 1

overal it was a complet wast of calori  im not ding mcdonald for my stupid curios so they get 3 star  the mcdonald experi was aok 

did i find valu in my meal  not todaymi fault though
wil i return  id come back again to order someth i enjoytwo hippi drop out of colleg and open up a pizzaria whew what a name eh well it final open and look to be promis with onli a few thing to work out ill keep this one short and sweet without do a disservic to the hippi  

first off there is no place to eat here it carri away onli we were actual go to have a few friend meet us up there but chang our mind after find this out know this we still made the drive to phoenix from scottsdal to check it out with mix result though it is there second day 

a killer thing about this place is the price the 12 pizza are 7 for either paper thin or hand toss if you dont specifi you get the hand toss they also have load of differ kind of wing 6 for a dozen so mani that it pretti hard to make a choic though we went with the spici bbq and the garlic parmesan the wing here are killer and worth order again sauc up nice and sloppi and perfect tender way to go plus you also get a ton of carrot and ranch dress i can go on and on about the wing but this is after all a pizza place

okay im not a fan of the pizza well not yet anyway i have to cut them some slack sinc they just open and might be still work out sourc and such we order 2 pizza the sausag as well as the cheeseburg for 7 these are quit hefti and have ampl top the two hippi never skimp on ingredi the bummer was that the sausag tast right out of a bag this is where the price point final factor in i would have prefer a better qualiti sausag this stuff tast much like the same stuff papa john might use not good the other problem is that the sauc was just tomato sauc and lack ani sort season includ salt the cheeseburg suffer from the lack of season as well though it was sur pile high with chees fresh tomato and ground beef the crust was tender but for me pizza crust should be chewi and crispi this was neither mayb just a prefer and im out of line 

all in all i like the new two hippi pizzeria though my feel right now that it just ordinari and not much differ from a chain ill be sure to go back in a week or 2 to see how they are do id imagin that they will be just fine

p the pizzaria spell isnt an error hmmm999 allyoucaneat dinner buffet wcrab legs

if you like chines food like sweet n sour chickenlot of seafood stuff like crawfishcrab legsshrimp and fish

they did have bbq pork but it was kinda tough

sever differ soup option around 60 item to choos from total pretti standard chines buffet fair

they do cook mongolian madetoord and they have soft serv ice cream

real cant complain for 10 pp but im no fan of asian food to start this certain did noth to chang my mind

pretti bore and fishi but still good cheap eat for those that like chines cuisini hate to admit it but im more impress with the season cocktail the charm decor and the waitstaff than the actual food the restaur provides

stil i think this place offer an excel and muchneed servic to the vegetarianvegan crowdthere a reason whi the twothre star review of disappoint palat and deflat wallet share the same webspac as the fivestar review that seem to featur broken capslock button and read like theyr taken out of an ebay custom satisfact survey

you have to know what your get into when you come here

a the proprietor herself put it the green owl seek to
pleas vegetarian and vegansboth those who gave up eat meat long ago and those who sometim still miss ita well as meateat who eat out with their vegetarianvegan famili member and friends

b chines ill proceed to do the math for you and enjoy it as to what follow logic from that mission statement


food
thi restaur is in no way a celebr of vegetarian vegan or what distinct flavor profil or textur veget themselv can offer  wherea asian cultur all with a high level of buddhist influenc celebr the mani variat of tofu like western celebr chees there is popular franchis restaur in china featur buddhist cuisin all tofu all the time this place is expressli tri to make veget deriv protein and fiber resembl meat

in that respect you can expect your sloppi joe or fish sandwich to undergo a bit more process than a meatbas equival to achiev the same desir goal  kind of analog to how much makeup a drag queen need to put on in comparison to someon who is femal to begin with in our case well the flavor just depend on if you notic the eggplant adam appl or not

money
al that veget makeup doesnt come cheap  the ironi is never lost on the engin in me that even though there a rough 101 convers of pound veget to pound of meat you can end up pay so much more for the veget equival debat see above

atmosphere
if your a vegetarian or vegan youv probabl alreadi notic that there tend to be a bit more malnourish rhetor bravado within your demograph skinni hipster  
your go to get those here  in fact you will probabl be seat next to one and he will probabl be have a veri opinion convers with himself that his friend are forc to listen while they wonder whi they bother to go to dinner with this guy anyway about whi the wine this place serv isnt as baseballgloveflavour as anoth vintag  im almost exagger but this guy ruin my appetit more than the food ever could

desserts
thes babi deserv a separ section all their own  thank mani dessert may use animalbas product but at least they dont need to featur them  in that respect this place realli shine for dessert  anyth off of the dessert menu can stand in it own right and there is no notic flavor nor textur differ between the vegetarian and vegan offer  they are also tastier and more uniqu than mani offer ive had at slight more upscal foodi establish in madison  hell i think this place may receiv better review if it just becam a complet vegan dessert shoppé

director cut
mi opinion of this locat are temper with the fact that i was a vegetarian for two short hungri year and i did it out of stubborn for my best friend who was one for most of her life out of sheer love for anim took me to a counti fair made me hug a piglet told me to think about him whenev i want bacon
in that respect i dislik this place see it menu offer as an affront to my stubbornness

at the same time stubborn can onli last so long and this place was absolut amaz to my besti whos spent much much longer than i have walk by everi other brat and burger joint madison has to offer

so there you have it take a look at the menu ahead of time tri not to be disappoint by the obvious cross your finger that youll be pleasant surpris and if all els fail jump straight to the dessert110310

a close cowork and good friend recommend i tri donna bakeri mani mani month ago mayb even a year ago whenev it was that it first open the owner are close famili friend of her  this visit was a spurofthemo decis a rare thing for me as i like to do some legwork first befor i tri a new place  i even text my friend for direct and dbs phone number so i could inquir if they were still even open for busi that evening

th young clerk i met there was veri friend and accomod answer most of my question w firm author and when he didnt know the answer especi that concern of the larg fruittop birthday cake in the display case hed pop into the kitchen and ask someon for the answer  i soon met the affabl mr of donna bakeri who inform me that the mrs donna had to leav town that even but not befor make the veri cake i had a fixat on that veri morn  i hadnt plan on make such a purchas esp sinc mom alreadi had a birthday pass but he made the cake sound so healthi made w allnatur ingredi no powder sugar cornstarch or corn syrup  the fruit were brush w a tapiocafruit juic glaze  i dont think it even had egg in the batter and top with fresh slice fruit w the except of the maraschino cherri and fill w more fruit insid  after select a few pastri to take home a slice of german chocolatemouss cake a coupl of redvelvet cupcak w ice top w red velvet cake crumbl  and someth akin to an almond sliveredtop and flatten mocha cream puff not pictur mr donna kind offer a 10 discount on the cake  still hesit in purchas such a big item i hadnt had a chanc to sampl i splurg and brought the cake home  

none of the smaller item wow me i found the cake textur to be veri tender yet lack in moistur strang but that birthday cake was veri veri good  the layer were made of angel cake and i love the fruitandcream fill the most  mom didnt think much of the slice she had but she was go through a period of a few month when she wasnt crave anyth sweet which was a good thing  so i slice the rest of the cake and brought it to work everyon who had cave in to the temptat love it  some even had second and thirds

i plan on go back to tri a few savori item that sound good on the menui notic month ago that construct crew were work on the structur former known as bahama breez note i didnt shed a tear when bahama breez shut down like a year ago im not general a fan of chain restaur other than jenni and the breez to me was noth more than a glorifi applebe with a pseudotrop theme whatev 

so what was this new establish go to be a walgreen cvs fresheasi a strip club dear lord pleas let it be a strip club im beg you it a good 40minut drive back home to ahwatuke from most of the other fine establish and ive found that the longer the commut the harder it is to get that stripper smell out of my car

much to my chagrin the joint reopen last week  not as a gentlemen club  but as the second come of bahama breez sandbar that was my impress as i pull into the park lot  that i had wait all this time and the place reopen as a smaller version of itself

but in fact sandbar is differ than applebe i mean turn out it like a cross between salti senorita and dos gringo sandbar also has locat in peoria and scottsdal neither of which ive been to nor did i know exist

th dig are pretti cool actual mexican beach theme with sever overhead door that bring the outsid in in fact the outsid bar area is surround by sand actual sand henc the name sandbar even though i got sand in my puma i decid it was a pretti cool touch ladi  you might not want to wear high heel howev continu with the theme they have cabana and a littl beachwad pool thing that i guarante drunk peopl will end up in on mani night even though it suppos to be just for looks

i had the famous sandbar chimichanga made famous appar by the other two locat as this one has onli been open for eight day and it was realli good i was pleasant surpris it seem to me that often time restaur that put so much effort into their theme have food that just eh the chimi is all i had so ive noth els to report culinarili just know that it was tasty

thirtysomeodd flatscreen scatter about the place look like it could be a good place to watch the game on sundays

th servic was just okay ill give sandbar a mulligan on that see as how it their first week in oper and i imagin theyr just tri to get their feet under them but it better rock next time 

it been said  and it entir true  that the place doesnt make the place the peopl make the place so ultim that will decid whether or not i frequent sandbar too soon to get a feel for the vibe here there was a whole rang of folk patron the place on this even probabl tri to figur out for themselv what kinda scene it gonna be from seem normal cool peopl to the did we get lost i thought we were on mill ave crowd to the doe my afflict shirt fit tight enough crowd to the they say 60 is the new 25 right crowd  they were all here on this even  eww but again a mulligan becaus the place is new well see 

still have sand in my puma three star for nowi think mayb i expect too much from the hype  in defens of hype there are a lot of folk here from the midwest and culver bring back a piec of their past  i know there are thing that if they show up here from santa barbara i would feel the same way

friday lunch the place was pack  there are 3 regist all in use and the drive through  i order the 499 special doubl chees butter burger fri and a soft drink and a 2 scoop custard 269  they had not had the softwar load to handl the special so they were not advertis it  the counter person had to find a manag to explain what the special was and how to handl it then had to come back at the end to key in a code with her card  i ask for everyth except mustard what i got was mayo and onion  there was a bottleneck at the soda machin which was dispens ice at about 3 cube a minut  i manag to find a seat and about 8 minut later my food arriv you place a number on your tabl and they find you  the burger was well done to the point of be crunchi around the edg  the crinkl cut fri were pretti good 

mi order taker ask if i want desert after the meal  this seem like a good idea so i agre  after i finish my meal i went to go get my desert  i first had to work backward through the soda backup then approach from the other direct i had to catch the attent of a server between order  this while get stare down by the 20 or so folk stand in line  i hand in my slip and was given a new number and went back to my tabl  i think i would take my chanc on the custard soften if i was to eat there dure a lunch or dinner rush again it add too much time to a lunch run 

strawberri cheesecak frozen custard  that was the flavor of the day  it came close to rival cold stone in overal tast qualiti and for consider less money

al the employe i came in contact with were pleasant and help  the new restaur is of cours spotless  they could have done better design with how they handl backup at the soda machin and more than a few folk in line have he line snake into the eat area creat a bit of a bottl neck  quit a few booth and tabl mani of which can be reconfigur insid  there is a good size mist outdoor seat areadang you culver with your proxim and conveni drive through with all the nearbi baskinrobbin and dqs now close i find myself at culver a bit too often

i do love frozen custard id like to say that im not go to say that i had way better frozen custard back east but im not becaus i did

nonetheless their is pretti decent they have some tasti flavor of the day the top are ridicul sweet howev but obvious it not enough to keep me away112910 and 121311

visit onc falafel pita and pizza and order takeout lamb pita  like the pita bread and the veggi though few use but the falafel portion were bland and dri  not even the extra garlic sauc and hummus for which i had to twist their arm for could add the flavor i was miss  the pizza while it look good in the box was also bland and veri greasi  i had one slice threw away the cheesebarren part which didnt leav much to eat and gave up due to see that huge  oil spill on the bottom of the box  brought the pie home and show it to mom and offer her some she declin  i tri toast a few slice the next day but by then i could see that the pizza realli didnt have much chees on it and the crust never crisp up in the toaster oven no matter how long i kept the slice in there  no wonder these pizza are sold on the cheap

th lamb pita was actual pretti good  i had low expect sinc the first two product didnt deliv but the lamb was actual quit nice tasti and not dri at all  it actual was better than the lamb wrap i tri a few day later from the newlyopen branch of pita jungl at scottsdal fashion squar oh the lamb serv there was horribl  hmm well i will say that we both like it and mom has request me to order it for her onc more after  strang though that the last two request for jami lamb pita she ask of me she quick retract say she chang her mind  i should get her to tell me whi the chang of heart

iv wonder about their special rosewat lemonad and their baklava but everi time i decid to tri one theyv just run outwhile wait for the winterfest parad to start i was in need of a caffein boost of energi so i stop into mocha joe there was a long line due to all of the peopl on water street for the parad staff seem to do the best that they could but it still took a while to get drink probabl could have use anoth employe for such a busi day 

i got the white mocha and had a shot of raspberri ad price was what i expect about 4 for a larg cup 

mi drink was excel nice and sweet just like i like it 

mi onli issu with mocha joe is the hour of oper they open at 7 am which is when i start work so no prework pickmeup from here for me also close on sunday35 stars

it was dead on a saturday night but they must have had a lot of takeoutdeliveri order becaus they had run out of green curri by 730pm  kinda crazi  

the menu was set up well sinc there were photo for everyth which made it much easier to know exact what was come we start with the duck spici salad sinc this was someth id never seen befor  the salad consist of duck with pineappl raisin tomato red onion cilantro green onion and spici lime sauc  that was 360 degre of flavor although i wouldv prefer a littl less duck skin 

i check out dan thai food addict ps review on my phone and he got the khao soi  id never tri khao soi and it not offer in a lot of thai spot so what the heck  the onli way i could explain it would be imagin if thailand had ramen  it had a realli good curri broth with 3 kind of beef slice tendon and chunk with soft egg noodl along with crispi egg noodl  i also agre with dan that there should have been more noodl but mayb it becaus i like it a lot  my wife got the tofu red curri which was fine  

corner thai has a big sign out front say they serv the best thai food in vega  that a pretti bold statement that they dont live up to but it a fine neighborhood spotwhen i first move here it was a micnic which is no more  a few year back federico acquir the properti and clean it up and paint it a bit brighter  this locat is open 24 hour but the dine room close from 15am  it a chain that start in new mexico and expand to arizona at some point in time they alreadi had a presenc here in 93 and was my first introduct to 24 hour taco shop  i havent been to one in a while for no particular reason except mayb they were not in my path when i want mexican

hav expand here from new mexico instead of the san diego area like filberto and their mani copi cat there are some differ in how ident menu item are prepar  i had my standard plate of shred beef taco and a chees enchilada with bean and rice 579 and a med fountain drink 149  first thing i notic was there was no greas in the taco  that may have been part of the slight flavor differ  also the chees enchilada was made with a corn tortilla instead of the more common flour  i thought they were a bit stingi with the chees on both item but i like lot of chees on almost anything

in general everyth was clean and while i was there the tabl were clean off and the salsa station was check and neaten up  this was a wednesday lunch and three tabl were in use and a few take out order handl  onli one person spoke english and then onli just enough to get his job donefinal have had a chanc to tri a burger here sinc my boyfriend has been tell me about it for the longest time we just happen to have a coupon for a buy one get one free burger from the 2013 entertain book so here we went for dinner i have no idea how the colleg kid can afford to eat here with these prices

they give you a product requisit form menu and you check off what you would like such as the size patti and the top you want this is creativ cute and perhap fun howev it just realli delay the time in get our order in myself be a grind burger virgin it just seem to take forev to go over the complet menu mark off what i want just to have the server repeat it back to us save the paper and print fee and just creat a more reason menu

everi item is ala cart which is fine howev when it is like that i expect the side item such as fri to be realli good not just ordinari i was disappoint with the fri they were lack flavor and the portion for what they charg was veri littl we order the short  thick fri which are potato wedg style and noth special

i decid on a 4oz burger 749 with cheddar 75 addit and free top of lettuc tomato onion and garlic mayo how is it free who want a plain burger serious and those are standard cheeseburg top to specifi them as free is absurd anyhow my boyfriend got the infam juici luci a patti with chees on the insid 1099 he opt for pepper jack he truli enjoy his burger that he had consum in less than 4 bite yike and that is an 8oz patty

i was joke with my boyfriend that this is not a place that i would come on a first date  as it was so damn messi the burger tast good and are realli juici as my meat juic and top were just ooz all over the place i had a damn hamburg salad left on my plate after i finish my burger 

the hamburg bun are the star player as they were so fresh and tasti almost a hint of sweet like hawaiian sweet bread

th servic was good mayb too attent we went on a sunday night and ask to sit in the bar so that we could watch the footbal game while eat unfortun we were the onli one there dine at the time which i usual like when we eat out rather than huge crowd the bartend gal had noth to do but focus on us she was nice but way too in our mix we just want to relax and eat and if you are come over everi second or talk to us from across the room everi moment it is rather annoy i know who complain about an attent staff howev this was beyond ridicul and avoid eye contact was not work either when i am busi stuf my face with a big fat juici burger the last thing i want to do is have to respond to a convers i never want to join in the first place  

this is one of those burger joint i onli need to tri onc i am one and done next


i post pictur of our meal as well enjoy 

entertain book 2013 save this meal 824sinc i was come out to vega i decid to check to see what groupon deal they had love find good deal

i ad bacon and avocado perfect touch 

short and thick fri yes that is what they are call steak fri cant realli go wrong 

pepperoni pizza noth spectacular but it a pizza and the kid love it 

chicken wing origin hot flavor meat was tender and chicken was messi just like how a chicken wang should be 

vanilla milkshak pretti good i like it a lotperfect for a hot day 

burger is good and major of the peopl there ate that i would say go for a good burger it off the strip less problem with traffic and touristok so we were at dino bar and were a bit hungri decid what we were go to do to fill our tummi as we had not had dinner we were drink and need someth on our stomach as to prevent the psycho drunk after effect as well

albo pizza is locat behind dino bar and has a nice indoor seat option if you choos to dine in

w opt to place an order for take out in which they actual walk it over and deliv to us at dino so we did not have to wait  yay

w order a larg albo special
pepperoni sausag ground beef ham onion mushroom black oliv green pepper 

pizza was good and plenti cheesi which is a bonus as they are a pizza shop that doe not skimp on the chees that is someth that drive me nut when you have to add chees as an extra top just to get a decent amount not here

pizza is good and the friend person servic is even better 

mi next trip to dino we may just have to order anoth pizza from albo 

they also had sever pasta dish that look yummi as well they have a wide and vari menu to choos from and not limit to pizzaim go to be real here im unimpress by this place 

first of all it is not hawaiian let just get that out of the way now half of the menu consist of taco wasabi is a common ingredi the standard side dish is coleslaw when everyon know in hawaii it macaroni salad let us all just agre to call this some a pan polynesianpan pacificsouthwestern american fusion restaur yeah i find that confus too 

our first trip to hula was unexpect we were walk from our friend home to maizi and decid we should just pop into hula on the way if you are take the lr i would suggest get off at the campbel stop but i think it 6 of one 12 dozen of the other between that and camelback if you are drive they have a huge park lot 

the initi visit was 4 day after they open and we had some hit and miss with the food i realli enjoy the fish cevich while my husband did not as he doe not usual like fish cevich the shrimp roll were a huge hit i thought that the hapu was adequ as was the mahi mahi our friend order a steak which was one of the grossest grizzliest steak i have ever seen we left that night want to tri it again so we made reserv for a group of friend for my husband birthday the follow week 

upon our return we tri the tuna poke which was fantast and the pull pork sandwich which was poor imo my kalua pork is a million time better on the first visit we had tri the sweet potato fri and they were pretti lacklust so we tri the plantain the second time around the fri plantain were some of the most disgust thing that i have been serv at a restaur in a long time i was hope for fri plantain in chip form but they were hunk of plantain plantain as a non fri fruit are not realli all that great there is a reason whi they are alway serv cook in some way by not split them up into smaller piec the starchi flavor is overpow as far as food is concern i feel that you have to realli tri differ thing to find their strength 

as far as drink are concern get the absolut boston with lemonad thank me later i have a phd in mai tai and i will tell you that these are just averag they are entir too sweet and the dark rum was not float on the top but rather it was shaken with the light rum like you would shake a martini that is not the proper way to make a mai tai we order a few volcano bowl for my husband birthday and while they were strong they were also veri sweet tropic drink dont have to be sweet i realli want a tropic itch or a lava flow but to be honest im not sure they offer them 

servic is hit or miss on his birthday my husband was wear a birthday hat and our server actual ask him in what i believ was complet serious if it was his birthday what realli 

the indoor space is great not such a fan of the light on the patio i think i will probabl be back for that adult arnold palmer and app at the time we were there they didnt have a happi hour but they have ad one nowi will apolog in advanc to amber w who will undoubt light my hous on fire after read my dissatisfact with her happi place but hula realli is a 2 12 star place to me ive been sever time at this point and while ill happili return when im in the mood for a fruiti oversyrup strong cocktail i will not howev be spend my money to eat there again

th first time i went with a small group in the springtim and we sat out on the patio which was a blast great ambianc and two over their 151 pack scorpion bowl later i was suffici black out unfortun the blackout did not happen soon enough to make me forget the flavorless and overcook ahi wonton i ordered

second time i went and ate was with amber w herself and i order the butterfish which was drench in a terribl thing overbear cream sauc i ask for it panfri and appar that is their definit of it certain not mine

al in all hula is a fun place to go hang out and have a coupl cocktail and enjoy the patio when it not 400 degre out but if your go there with the hope of be wow by exemplari seafood you will be sore disappointmy how time fli  i rememb all the buzz when this build was be remodel  now almost a year and a half after it open and a bunch of review i final had the opportun to dine here  i was amongst a smunch group that met for brunch on a saturday  

i love the space a combin of indoor outdoor and part of both  

the servic for our parti of about 20 was realli great  our group consist of folk from 1 to over 60 and all our need were well attend to

their brunch menu consist of item from their regular corpor menu and some special item design local  i chose the island egg benedict and enjoy it and the hash brown it came with  i order the decaf and it is the first decaf i have had in a long time that tast like a real cup of coffe  at least at our tabl i heard no big complaint about the food

a coupl of thing that kept my rate at 35 instead of 4  park suck this is more import to those like myself not use to uptowndowntown venu one of my poach egg was hard cook in the middle

i would certain not complain about go here againdefinit of aok
not a destin dine experi that for sure
i would say overhyp but overhip is more like it

im sure it all so impress to someon less jade and cynic but cmon 
this is realli noth more than someon collect all of the exot dish one at a time from generic american resto like applebe and chili and combin them onto one menu in one place

omigosh you put a ring of grill pineappl and some terriyaki on my chicken sandwich  oooh how pacif rim fusion  someon call martin dennithe checkin offer i receiv a while back is appar invalidasid from that this place is pretti cool  the cocktail are fair good especi if you are into rum the atmospher is vibrant and the servic is general spoton  this is one of those place where the first thing i had off the menu rock and that is all i ever orderso i high recommend the cevicheyummi marin white fish on crispi wanton chip  when ever i am outandabout in central phoenix this is alway a spot i consid hit up along the routhula has captur perfect that hip urban midtown phoenix atmospher youll alway find a crowd their fire pit is pretti interest the indoor and outdoor space are cool and theyv got poster of old surf movi on the wall in the bathroom i was onc inspir to tri and find one of them but wasnt abl to on netflix or amazon mayb i just wasnt realli that dedic to the task at hand though

iv been to hula a number of time now and onli about half of my visit i was order food not to say their food isnt appet just that hula work well as both bar and grill and im not alway out dure lunch or dinner while a bit on the upper end of my dine out price rang everi time ive order food it was either good or delici but when order a drink i usual stick with a vodka  soda their other drink just arent for me

their signatur cocktail are general made with either rum tequila or vodka or some mixtur of two or three of them but ive found that a lot of them are to sweet for my tast im not a real fan of super sweet drink and they can reach level of excess in my opinion my favorit food item on their menu are the pork taco and you can order one taco dure happi hour for about 3 hh is monday  friday until about 6pm ive also had their sweet potato fri tofu taco edamam a hula burger and their macnchees all were tasti and worth come back for but i imagin ill tri someth differ next time like their habanero chicken taco or their hous made black bean burger

overal hula is a fun spot to meet with friend but i wouldnt go here for more than one or two cocktail unless your look to leav with a sugar high

happi yelp phoenixi have heard about jollibe for quit some time and final got the chanc to tri it out today  a friend had told me that it was like the filipino version of mcds and kfc combin with some tradit filipino stapl thrown in the mix  and yep that is what i thought when i saw the menu

w had the fri chicken and the spaghetti today  the fri chicken was tasti and i realli like the gravi to dip it in  yum  the spaghetti was realli differ sinc it had chees on top a sweet tomato sauc and some hot dog piec all mix togeth  i know it sound super weird but it was actual good in a strang way  

it was a cheap meal too for 2 adult meal and a kid meal the total was onli 16  not too shabbi for lunch  i wish i was more hungri becaus there were a lot of fun look dessert to tri  mayb next timeand there will be a next timein the area for an appoint we were tri to find someth quick to eat at 1030 in the morn and didnt want ihop so we decid to give jollibe a shot ive been to jollibe in so cal befor but never to one here in town ive never been a huge fan but figur id give them anoth shot

i got the spam breakfast and it was ok the best thing about this place is that everyth is so cheap even for fast food noth amaz but it satiat our crave for a quick and cheap meal while we were in the area good for what it is cheap fast foodok came here to enjoy happi hour and the servic was ok  waitress realli did not want to help us she rather be somewher els for sure  
i have had better time in other bar outdoor patio than here so i must onli rate this an ok place  wish i could give it a higher rate whi you ask  the place is nice just the servic is ugh and the crowd  wish it could be a younger crowd but it seem to attract sun citi here and not surpris  luckili the patio is big so our group could be far from the other patron061611

wa hungri and decid to tri the new addit a few month anyway to scottsdal fashion squar food court  decid to see if the hummus httpwwwyelpcombizphotospitajunglescottsdale2selectaxukqfjnvehntadsybtnswaxukqfjnvehntadsybtnsw was just as tasti as the one at the restaur across the valley  decid to round the meal with a salad as well  the present of the food wasnt veri appet the price of what you pay for here are about the same youd pay at the standalon restaur so id suggest just dine at the restaur to get the ad ambienc rather than sit at the food court use styrofoam plate and plastic box and utensil  atmospher would be more relax as well  howev if look for healthier option at scottsdal fashion squar courtyard then pita jungl is one of the veri few

i tend not to return to place that use styrofoam cup and plate  sorri but it my way to help reduc the amount of styrofoam that enter landfills

not to pj pleas consid sourc paper plate and biodegrad utensil instead  most peopl in your target demograph wont mind pay slight higher price for the switchthis place is locat in the locat previous occupi by samurai sam  it is typic chines take outfast food  it is fair larg for it type of busi as it seat over 80 in a combin of tabl and booth  there is a window bar seat area left over from sam  i am not sure exact when they first open but i spot the grand open sign when i stop at gnc on sunday

i had general tso chicken 750 and a glass of red wine 375  the plate of food was huge i realli should have made two meal of it but i alreadi had lunch cover everi day this week  it as did all the other order i saw came out fast  it tast like i expect  i chose the egg fri rice and i like the fact they go easi on the soy sauc which make it a bit lighter in color than some other place but it also has less salt  as the name impli there are no veget in the rice  the chicken was on a thin bed of onion and carrot with some broccoli and snow pea added

th servic was excel  there were never more than 3 tabl at a time occupi while i was there  and 3 server one of which i think was an owner  i think mayb out of boredom each of them check twice to make sure i was fine  the place is spotless and the decor pleasant in a combin of bright and mute color  their choic of music that even was kyot smooth jazz

start out in this economi in a larg end cap unit in a relat newer strip mall has got to be riski  there is a smaller but well establish chines take out in the mall across the street and well as 4 other fast food place on the same corner  you cant see the unit from the street becaus it is hidden behind the safeway gas station  they have a few grow pain to get through also  the onli import beer i saw was heineken no asian beer offer  their red wine is a bering white zinfandel  while this is a safe wine to serv it should be label someth els and mayb bring in someth like a barefoot cellar merlot in about the same price rang as their red  the websit shown on their take out menu is not yet exist so i will not post it

and befor i forget they have a frequent diner card gooooo devil 

i came here for the first time with a friend for happi hour he said they have pretti good special and everyth was half off i got the happi hour menu and order the devil island bewar when drink this it like a long island but better and extrem strong 

i also order the nacho which were pretti good i realli like the melt chees that they use it was quit yummi 

im give this place a 3 star becaus the happi menu is quit confus it give you a list of item of food happi hour item then on the back is the drink menu howev those drink were not on happi hour so appar mine was not my friend order a regular long island and the waitress didnt even know if it was on happi hour or not seem like she wasnt veri knowledg of the happi hour menu if you go to their websit they have an entir differ happi hour menu it quit confus 

i think it a realli good place to hang out with friend for a drink or watch the game i realli like my drink and nacho id come back but i definit think they need to creat a better happi hour menu for their custom and their staff need to be more knowledg with it121109
first visit was with fellow yelper violeta h  i arriv earlier so i wait for her at one of the tabl out at the heat patio  nice space though i didnt like the fact that my view of the cozi bar area was block from the tabl that i was first taken to so i request to be move closer  no problem  i also found that some area in the patio can be privat as in your hidden from street view so if that what import to you be sure to canva the area so that you may request your spot
a v alreadi point out we did have a problem w the dirti appet plate  i had to use the women restroom while we wait for the food to arriv and when i came back violeta was alreadi snack on complimentari bread and butter on a veri attract blue and yellow print saucer plate  there were mani vari style stack beneath a pizza stand so i rifl through a few befor find one that match her  wouldnt you know it that the one i chose was one of two that had grime on  vs plate seem clean enough but the third from the top as well as mine which was second from the bottom of about 7 or 8 stack had oili smudg on them mine look like a schmear of butter    needless to say i didnt even tri the bread and violeta drop her piec when i show her my plate
and yes the wine was serv in a whiskey glass look at whiskey glass varieti on nextagcom for comparison as im type this  call me oldfashion but i like my cab serv in a cab wine glass
now let get to the pizza  the happi hour menu featur a few wine by the glass at discount price most of the pizza halfoff as well as some of the appet at lower price  today she order the roast chicken hh 625 and i the four chees hh 495  both pizza were veri good  so good that despit the dirti plate incid i came back the ff tuesday for anoth hh jaunt stay tune for an updat soon  the roast chicken pizza came w parmesan onion gorgonzola and apricot while the four chees came w mozz asiago gorgonzola and provolon   befor i forget v and i end our meal w a cherri crostada w almond crumbl and ciao bella honeyvanilla gelato  we thought it charm that our server split our dessert into two plate  
btw as it was the christma season marcella was sell gift card that came w bonus gift card  100 worth or more net you an extra 25  the origin gift card could be use ani time and for ani food and alcohol purchas while the 25 bonus had to be use at a later date and could not be use for the purchas of alcohol beverag

weath was beauti so we ask for patio seat  took advantag of the happi hour menu to tri mom alltim favorit appet calamari  which we havent tri here yet  we also order an appl salad  servic was quick and friendly

th appl salad was fantast  chock of mix green crunchi granni smith appl slice and candi walnut and top w gorgonzola and sherri vinaigrett it was larg enough for two  we were almost too full to tri the calamari  one look at the app and we knew it would be a winner  the calamari was veri good light batter and nice crisp  not too greasi  we also enjoy the fri zucchini and lemon slice that came w the calamari

four star for the entir experi had the calamari been a littl less saltiafter read mani review of this place i decid to stop by here for lunch and tri it for myself  i was pleas to see how nice the decor of the restaur was  there are two dine room area and bar seat  the owner leticia greet me and ask me if i want a tabl or sit at the bar  sinc i was eat alon i saddl up to the bar and order from the bartend  

i decid on the nacho and a raspberri ice tea to wash it down  while i was wait for my order a server brought out complimentari chip bean and salsa  in vega it rare to get bean with the comp chipssalsaalso there were two salsasa chipotl base salsa and an avocadocilantro base salsait was excellent

a few minut later my nacho came out  they were cover in chees and had two small portion of sour cream  guacamol on topcertain not enough for the entir dish  the nacho has a lot of potentialth chip were fresh all of the ingredi tast veri goodbut the proport were all mess up  too much chees not enough sour creamguacamolepico de gallojust the right amount of bean  jalapeno  the chees was melt just right but with some bite it overwhelm the dish  a lot of potenti here

overal i enjoy the meal and love the friend servic and activ owner who care about her restaurant

1 beef soupa milki white soup made of longsimm ox leg bone i like to add a lot of chop scallion  chili season after serv to give it a littl kick but some peopl prefer it plain with rice and banchan 
2 hang over soupi had it not after consum alcohol but oder it to go when i was down with a cold it is basic a spici beef soup with lot of cabbag leek bean sprout  slice of tender beef it is a veri healthi soup becaus it s got lot of vitamin and nutrient

2 star for the food

pop over to modern steak to have their hh happi hour 2 slider and instead found that the price have increas 2 for 6 i believ  id want to tri their truffl fri but thought id tri the fri at modern burger first to have someth to compar the truffl fri to the next time i visit  the slider 575 for two but i might be wrong tast like they did in the past and were the same size as those i had dure happi hour  so whi the increas at modern steak  the fri were soggi and therefor were horribl to me and i wonder if the truffl fri are even worth come back for now  

servic was friend and accomod so im ad an extra stari judg my lunch and dinner place to a differ set of criteria  for lunch it about conveni cost and tast  a distant fourth criterion might be the relat nutrit valu of the meal  firehous win on the first three and is worthi of inclus into the lunch time rotation

th sandwich are hearti heavi and tasti  denser and more robust flavor then youd get at the chain sub spot  i doubt that this place will win ani accolad from the american heart associ but i also doubt that 85 percent of it patron even consid calori count when they order one of these sandwich  

a great sub  just make sure you eat fruit veget and other healthi option when your not hereim pretti sure this is not seattl best coffe  it not even las vegass best coffe  

ive had better coffe in las vega and seattl  and phoenix  and los angel  and new york  and boston  and chicago  and denver  and philadelphia  and cleveland  and tucson  and dalla  and salt lake citi  and san francisco god yes  and well you get the idea  

it might be easier to list place i have not had better coffe  gillett wyom would be one  and milton vermont  and el paso texa  oh while were on texa throw in amarillo lubbock midland and odessa  

blyth california  didnt have better coffe there  cumberland marylandnop not there either  you know what this is not a good approach for this review let just drop it right here

thi place is locat just insid the south point casino  they have perfect fine general strong brew coffe as well as espresso drink and a small select of pastri and bagel  

im pretti sure seattl best is own by starbuck just so you knowi have to say that gimm some sugar is decor veri cute and look like it could be a great place to hang out  they do have beer wine and bubbl to partak in and that is a great highlight

im go to prefac this by say that the ladi who were work the even that we went were veri interest in our opinion on what we thought about the bake goodi  i had the rice krispi bar and my hubbi had the tiramisu  the rice krispi bar was good but noth to write home about the chocol was a nice touch  my hubbi had the tiramisu  the bottom half was the best part  one of the ladi actual took the part that were not eaten to show to the chef as where they could improv 

ill need to give this place anoth shot in the futur  they are quit a few more item to tri and from what i hear from other they are worth triin the area and crave a sweet i decid to check my bookmark and lo and behold gimm some sugar pop up on my yelp app bookmark 

have heard some good review from trust yelper i was excit to give them a tri i walk in and the place is super cute clean and welldecor i was greet warm by the three girl work at the counter they were readi for ani question and had plenti of suggest for me while i perish their inventori i had my heart set on a macaron and they are huge interest flavor as well i decid on the fig  goat chees and the mapl bacon i also had some question on some price for specialti cake and tower and they were veri help and assist me with all my question and gave me lot of inform and contact inform if i decid to order someth for the futur 

the macaron were flaki and moist i didnt love the flavor but they were ok i took a few bite and didnt realli feel the need to finish them id be back if im in the area to see what els they have to offerdo i give it 3 star do i give it 4 usual if i cant decid i go with the lesser until they have proven me wrong i think eventu i will up this review a star but base on my first experi we will start with averag 
all of my yelp friend alway talk about this place check in post pic and it so close to me hous final after work one night i had a sweet tooth and stop in 
off top 5 star for décor and custom servic i love the old school classi barber shop wineri ladi saloon style all in one i was instant greet with a smile and a hello light was dim but appropri 
i was instant drawn to the berri mascarpon cake 2 of my favorit in one 7 for a small piec i was disappoint not enough mascarpon and it was like a berri gelatin not bad but not what i expect 
i took home chocol cover strawberri 3 for 6 decent cooki macaroon and a coupl other random price were ok 
i could imagin myself love this place and enjoy a glass of wine n cupcak after work entir to often whos my first yelp date down for drink and dessert jessi b shirley bit nice to know what to expect  

in a fantast citi that is known as the entertain capit of the world the mont carlo casino was less than impress  we had expect someth much more spectacular  if this was as the other casino were a replica of the truelif experi then mont carlo would not be on my grand tour itinerari  

it was almost a relief to find a littl food court in the back of the casino near the hotel lobbi fill with american concess  starbuck was there  

we order a grand tazo shaken tea a tall nonfat latt and a raspberri tart for 995  as we enjoy our snack in a common dine area  this was a real food court like youd find in ani mall  we plan our escap to the next casinogot togeth with lindsey lynn jessica donald angela  robyn for yelp offic hour here today  it was lot of fun  good food  for this first visit i just had a regular burger  fri which were good but not unusu except that the sesam seed bun which was a nice touch  im told the real deal here is to get the italian beef sandwich so ill return sometim soon to give that a tri    

burger 419 fri 189last friday at yelp offic hour here i had a nice lunch here have one of their regular burger  fri  gave lobbi 3star  i learn afterward though that i hadnt realli order the real deal so i got togeth with lynn w yesterday to return  tri donald ss special sandwich this time

her the order  an italian beef hot with provolon  hot giardiniera full dip plus a fries

pretti soon here came my sandwich  this babi has been complet dip in au jous so it more of a knife  fork sandwich than one you eat with your hand unless you dont mind get them all wet  either way it realli good

italian beef sandwich order as abov a littl pricey at 738 fri 189ok this is new china buffet  clever name eh  it occupi the build  took the phone number of east buffet which close over 2 year ago

thi is a nice place fair larg  there a banquet room avail to hold you  about 40 of your closest yelpi friend  i count up a generous select of 69 main food choic  there are plenti of comfort booth  tabl to choos from  the worst about the place is hot air blower instead of paper towel in the bathroom  their chow mein is greasi  with that said the food was good overal  there were special treat here  there such as the delici lyche pork  the some tangi bread chees sticks

lunch 699 includ drinkdude it pinksin vega my two favorit thing in the world ok i realli dont feel that way but if i was a surfer dude from redondo beach out with my bud for a vega weekend this would certain be my dine destin of choic sinc im not i guess i can be a littl more discrimin but dude it pink well not quit pink just a reason facsimil in an apt set planet hollywood 

jami w and i realli want some dog after stroll through the steril citi center complex which has none of the kitsch that realli is vega luckili pink has kitsch to spare in it patio set outsid the hotel entranc the menu look familiar we decid to each get a 475 giant 12inch jalapeno dog with nacho chees and chili and share a 650 planet hollywood dog which consist of a polish sausag grill onion grill mushroom bacon and chees see photo oh did i mention the fri too nice and tasti they were 

indigest thi name is pink the jalapeno dog has that snap to the wiener that i dont care for much i prefer a meatier dog to the tooth and the mustard was way overwhelm but chili chees and dice onion are bulletproof on a dog as far as im concern the planet hollywood dog has quit a pile of top to maneuv in your mouth start with the bacon strip lord over the sausag alreadi drown in melt chees the mushroom seem almost incident to the creation but they were good hell it was all good in a bad bad way 

food  3 starsquit an abund of top on those dog but not quit the pink i rememb in la 
ambianc  2 starshel it just a patioin pink 
servic  25 starsjust keep move the line and the dog will eventu be there 
total  3 starsa middl experi base on a distant memori of the pink in laafter check in and settl down in our planet hollywood room anchale was starv for someth simpl we hadnt eaten anyth sinc our breakfast at firewood grill insid sfo at about 10 am and now it was around 330 pm the first eateri that caught her eye was pink hot dog locat outsid planet hollywood but still around the premis becaus she was think of top dog in berkeley you realli couldnt miss it with it big pink sign 

there was a super extens menu of dog burger burrito soda and alcohol beverag side and dessert we chose onli one hot dog to share a nake polish sinc we werent look for all the fixin can you realli justifi a 6 polish dog and that befor tax too mayb it was possibl for the polish dog size and sinc we were in a tourist attract citi but i wouldnt want to pay this price on a daili basi if it includ a drink as a meal then mayb that a deal yes the polish was spici juici and hot but there wasnt anyth special about the bun 

after consum this expens snack i thought to myself i cant wait to get back to the bay area so i can realli be spoil and eat a good hot dog from top dog for 325 each 

famili own sinc 1939 it alway worth a tri for someth new with a littl flairpink was one of the cheapest meal we had in vega 26 for three peopl was a nice chang of pace from spend tripl  quadrupl that at other eateri 

this was my first time eat at this vega locat but id been to the origin so cal one a few time i order my usual a veggi hot dog cover in chili chees  onion complet messi  total heavi in the stomach exact what junk food should be my companion order polish dog 

even though i dont eat meat hot dog i like that i dont have to be exclud from dine at pink with peopl who do becaus they serv veggi dog browni point for that pink food is kind of eh but it fun to eat outsid under heat lamp  surround by light on the stripit pink it fast it cheap food on the strip

ther was absolut no line when we walk in on a tuesday night for preclub eat it doe howev make me wonder whi the one back in la alway has a long line

i like that their menu specifi that their veggi burger is vegan it 679 it decent i ad guacamol to mine httpsupr96msdn

179 is a lot for guacamol but i feel like the burger wouldv suck without it

i bet it would tast even better with grill mushroom but i would have to pay anoth 149 to add that

i guess it kinda cool that they serv jello shot even though vegan me didnt have one my friend paid 20 for six shot and it came with free french fri httpsupr5talb6pink is enter it 73rd year in busi admit when compar price with the origin los angel venu the vega spot appear much more expens predictable

not realli see a death spici option not say that i was gonna find one i got whatev could be interpret as spici to some peopl the spici mojav dog 849 was my choic yeah you read that right it was gonna basic be 9 with tax for a damn hot dog polish sausag nacho chees pickl jalapeno grill onion guacamol and tomatoes

it look and tast like your basic hot dog bun here with the larger polish sausag and an abund of top it realli need one of those larg gourmet bun to even give me a shot to pick it up fork and knife would have to do

flavorwis it did the job it basic as good as i could have expect this to be great snap from the polish dog nacho chees felt like it came from a contain the veggi and the guacamol tast fresh my issu is simpli the price there no way this poor panda would even want to pay around 9 for a hot dog even if edibl gold was attach to this sucker besid id take the edibl gold and tri to extract monetari valu from it anyway

i look at the yelp review for the los angel pink and it around a threestar averag same as the vega spot ani complaint are like direct at the price or the hot dog not live up to the hype the line also longer in la so that probabl also affect the review rate still it make me wonder if the los angel spot is better

pink was good for the experi i cant complain much about the food other than not be abl to pick it up but i also dont want my wallet to have a reason to riot again13010

stop in while wait for food to cook at the market next door  cute littl space  the cooki look delici but as soon as i ask my standard question the barista went on the defens and i lost the cozi warm feel i had upon enter  the latt i chose tast greatmy wife and i came here to use a groupon we purchas  we use to come here period but havent been back in year with the prolifer of new restaur in the area 

we were brought ice tea quick and a basket with some corn muffin and butter  our server desire took our order prompt  i got a cup of bake potato soup with bacon and chive top  it had a lot of chees mix in and it was excel  it didnt help with my cold much but it was worth the try

for our main we each got the 6 ounc filet serv with larg potato wedg and a ramekin with cream spinach and some brown chees on top  the season on the potato wedg and the steak were veri tasti and the steak were good like we order  

we had the smaller steak so there was room for dessert  we should have share  they were veri larg  my wife got the browni with ice cream and i got the pecan and chocol pie  both were veri good

a few thing about the servic  evid there onli one person serv at the time we were there and we wait sever minut for someon to come to seat us  later desire had to take care of all the tabl and our wait for thing was longer than need be  

a veri pleasant meal in nice surroundyup  i did it  i took the famili to the boofay and it didnt make us sick  
i am not usual a huge buffet kinda gal  but i was interest in tri this place and with the recommend of the scab y  
 superior crew of boofay of yelp  also known as ryan  daren rand norm and iain i was sure i couldnt go wrong  take in consider of the genr of this establish this was a pretti good oper while a pungent sour smell hit you upon walk in  you quick dismiss it upon the view of food  the food was strong  decent  my favorit was a chicken they name bbq chicken  iron becaus it was a light teriayki  but whatev it their restaur and they can name it whatev they like but it wasnt bbq
they also had  wait for it crab leg cool   the other item were good and look good veggi on the line still look fresh and not overcook they had some interest fish concoct with shrimp and octopus  that caught my interest the sushi line look onc again decent but of cours tast onli okay  orang chicken and beef rib  tast good there was also big assort of shrimp dish  for a minut i went all bubba gump 
 fri shrimp  salt and pepper shrimp shrimp tempura cold shrimp coconut shrimp then i rememb it 2010  and i snap out of it  they also had a few dessert which we didnt tri and ice cream which the kid fulli appreci 
for the price of 1000 a person it was reason if you take into consider it a  chines buffet we decid this a good place to go if you are crave panda express or teriakyi  chicken   
servic was good and we got in and out of there relat easilii havent had a full dine experi here yet but i want to relay last night delight visit to fnb  i swung by last night for dessert with the girl and fnb was pack i love the decor and the new floor is exquisit and i think theyv made it look a much loveli dine experi all around especi consid the space constraint 

we wait a few moment at the door while pavl and co found us seat at the bar though we were there for sweet dottsi couldnt resist get an order of the rock shrimp with jalapeno tartar sauc and god bless her it was delight mmmm now i want more of itanyway we went ahead and order 1 of each of the dessert on the menu onli 3 last night were not anim i order the appl ginger thingi cant think of the name sorri dottsi had the chocol cherri bread pud and chrissi had the lemon creme brule the creme brule blew me away it was so delic and light infus with lemon essenc it was like a pillow of sugar delici the chocolatecherri dessert was a mouth full of yum as well and my appl ginger dessert was tasti thought i like a bit more ginger zing in general ohh they are so good 

the rest of the dinner menu look fantast as well i will be back to test the rest of it out soonmayb my expect are get highbut whi not   we went to fnb last night and the menu lack great choic  the whole menu except for the last 4 item and one item on the top was all vegetarian  

we start with the chees plate and it was a small slice of blue breenut and burnt piec of nut bread that we wit be scrape off after it was burn and a blob of yucki apricot goowouldnt the dish washer tell them no one was eat it

next we had a brais leek with mozzarella with a fri egg on itit would be fine as a side but not an app

next came the pastait was ok not hous made it had a heavi sauc and a lot of chewi mushroomssquash cube and wilt baconnoth special

dessert was a steam chocol cake that was dri as a bone serv with a tabl spoon size scoop of banana ice creamth coffe was pretti good

th tap water was even bad so we order bottled

i fear that the owner are cut corner and make thing that are easi to make with the small quarter they have  we have been mani time befor and the menu has been more inspir and so has the food  i hope they are not get burn outi dont know about anyon els but to me this place seem sort of doom base on the histori lesson we learn in the tini museum shack tortilla flat has burn down or been destroy somehow about 3 or 4 time consid the fact that it was suppos start by a nogood ragamuffin lowdown dirti thiefmurder who lost his booti somewher out in the desert mayb it wasnt meant to last this long 

but this is america we can keep anyth aliv and run if it earn enough money hallelujah prais the sweet babi jesus

accord to some mathemat equat theyv estim that the saloonrestaur has over 80000 in singl dollar bill stapl to the wall kind donat by tourist and lookieloo from round the world the town itself was most recent purchas by some compani for over 13 million dollar it was origin purchas for 11000 

as of today in the year of our lord 2013 the great attract of tortilla flat is the burger in the restaur the live music in the saloon onli part of the year and the prick pear gelato in the ice cream parlor which you cant tast befor you buy 

it also doesnt hurt that the drive there is quit beauti we did it on a motorcycl and had a grand old time swoop around the curv and pass elder outoftown in their comfort suv 

might as well do it onc if you live here but im not sure i would recommend it to visit snow birdperfect happi hour monsat 3pm6pm

hh app menu is veri reason here  so reason i spent about 50 with tip on 3 glass of wine 5 each 12 pcs of bruschetta fri 3 i think and chicken wing 3 for 12  id skip on the ordinari chicken wing which came w jicama slice and ranch dress next time but the parmesan fri are dlish  i must warn you that if you lack even an ounc of willpow do not order the bruschetta  especi not the appl and brie nor the fig and mascarpon  oh my godbig expect open tabl reserv point and a groupon led us here

not surpris i found it laid back yet design for the young upward mobil  chic with some section insid set up with comfi couch and loung chair to make it feel more homey plus restaur tabl for the remaind there was also a small outdoor patio we opt for indoor due to the high wind this day but the indoor did not strike me as particular cramp as some have describ but then this was midweek lunch and there were few peopl to compet with

lamb burger it came cook to a perfect med rare just as mr b had ask  the flavor of the meat surpris me  it was season with a blend of middl eastern herb not your tradit gamey american version it was huge with tomato and babi green to make it look even bigger  he love it

th wine club  start with a nice toast bread then layer of bacon chees pork belli thin slice turkey chunk of avocado tomato and lettuc it was a thick sandwich  unfortun as good as it sound it was a disappoint  primarili it was becaus the turkey was dri and old tast  but even so it was not speak my languag  the subtleti were lost by too mani delic flavor all tri to compet for attent the thin slice of pork belli was complet overwhelm by the other layer the avocado was butteri but similar lost  what was a winner were the slice of bacon and the chees both flavor stand out i final got wise and ate each layer independ of the other and then i could smile except for the turkey

i got to choos one side and that had to be the butternut squash soup but today must have been an off day  it was not excel  it wasnt even good  it was quit bland no sweet from the squash at all  disappointed

they also offer a 5 glass of wine  not shabbi and actual quit a nice pour  you can choos ani wine from their list and it is a long one again mr b was happi he love his merlot

our cute french server stephani took great care of us

unfortun i will not budg higher than a 35 star rate becaus of my sandwich and soup the groupon manag to soften the damag but i person would not be real enthusiast about returnwe were stay at aria and we decid to have dinner at beso  i love eva longoria restaur in cali and so i had high expect for beso  the booth are nice and comfi but the servic leav a lot to be desir  my filet steak was just averag and the price are veri high  cocktail start at 14 and up  we had an app of guac and chip and that was below averag  as i mention i love eva restaur in cal but i was disappoint in beso at citi centermy wife and i celebr our eleventh anniversari last night by go to beso steakhous at the citi center we hadnt been there befor and want to tri someth differ of cours be the signatur restaur for the hot and beauti eva longoria we had high hopes

th reserv process was simpl we made the reserv onlin in about 1 minut and indic on the reserv form that it was our anniversary

whil our high hope werent dash they were somewhat dampen first the restaur is beauti insid tast dark and underst decor the server prompt and attent almost too attent at time but we never had to look around wonder where they were id give them good mark for servic although when we arriv we were the earlier diner the place did fill up quick after we arriv although im sure it had noth to do with our be there

w were given menus along with a drink menu and recommend we were also prompt brought small but delici glass of champagn with congratul for our anniversari kudo for that touch

w order drink and the waiter said he would wait and bring those with our food sinc we were enjoy the champagne

w took our time order start with a crab louie salad which we share it was well prepar delici and adequ for the two of us to share the green were fresh and crisp and the asparagus spear steam but still crisp

sinc we were in no rush we order dinner after the salad was finish so that threw off their time a littl and it took awhil to get  there which was no problem for us we order the 20 oz filet mignon with butter steam lobster and a side dish of macaroni and chees 

moment befor the food arriv our waiter brought the drink we had orderedfor kath a pineappl surpris i think the surpris was that it was pink and didnt tast like pineappl but it was tasti and not too sweet i had a margarita rock with herradura silver tequila that was wonderful

 the entre was well prepar and as order the mac and chees hot and tasti not too creami like some

w were stuf by the end of the entre but couldnt resist two cappuccino and what we expect was a small dessert surpris the capp were serv in overs cup with load of foam rather than those dainti cup that i can never get my sausag finger through we order the pineappl upsid down cake ani theme here and it came out bake to order in a small iron cauldron which the waiter upend on a plate leav a cake the size of a small derbi two bite and we were done

ok great servic terrif food and not the usual peasiz portion of higher end restaur so whi the three star ok here my thought on that dinner was about 200 with the tipnot unexpect even though we split the salad entre and dessert 

so for a good meal for two you could expect to get closer to 350 or so if you didnt split for that price level one would expect someth truli special someth outstand but it just was your averag realli good steakhous and vega abound with those sort of place for less think del frisco on paradise

so without a doubt it was a wonder and magic even but more becaus i was share it with my wonder wife of eleven year than ani other reasonthis is a review of the afternoon tea servic  this time with onli 2 peopl instead of 6 the last time

th skinni although a beauti view the uncomfort seat miss with the food and tea made this place a 3 servic a littl on the slow side the servic was onli soso 3 valu now onli 1 refil of the petit four scone and sammi boo 3

after a lazi sunday morn i decid to treat the hubbi to a relax afternoon tea at 3 pm when your make reserv for 2 peopl it relat a breez with opentablecom compar to my larg group experience

ther are veri few place that serv afternoon tea on the strip the mandarin orient get bonus point becaus it may be the onli one on the strip that offer spectacular view oper everi day of the week and wont leav you smell like youv been cavort around the casino all day ie not smokey

for our littl teteatet we both order the classic afternoon tea set 40 per person choic of loos leaf tea 1 refil each of scone sandwich and petit four 

after be spoil by the pennisula in chicago their tea servic is okay in my book pet peev  i didnt like the fact that their loos leaf tea was serv without tea leav in the teapot and while my jasmin white pearl tea was quit nice the matcha tea was over mild and lack flavour

ther were some issu with the food the sandwich had quit nice fill especi the curri chicken sandwich admit the ham sammi were a littl on the unorigin side unfortun the bread was a littl too dri which detract from the overal experi 

scone serv appropri warm were a littl too mushi on the insid while the devonshir cream lack that butteri custardi aroma the homemad preserv of blueberri and mix berri were hohum and didnt offer someth excit the fig jam at the previous event was much more intrigu and delicious

fin the petit four tray the onli dessert i wouldnt have mind a second tast was the almondmarzipan macaroon slight chewi the almond past realli knock that cooki out of the park for me the opera cake chocol ganach tart and matcha financi were textur a littl dri the chocolatecaramel tart was over sweet

th servic consid how much you are pay for an afternoon tea here was okay but not spectacular our server took a long time to bring out our tea and didnt refil our glass of water she also forgot to bring out refil of our condiments

overal despit it shortcom it was a pleasant afternoon experi and deserv a 3star reviewbe the foodcraz person that i am i perus the menu extens befor make reserv for my husband and i for nye we even half way pick out what we were go to have befor arriv yup im food obsess i was beyond psych to tri the lobsterpineappl and ahi tunaraspberri 

drink order were taken after 20 minut drink order were forgotten servic was pretti damn bad in general also i did experi the issu the other person face where they kept ask about dessert after 10 minut with our first cours wtf these thing i can forgiv them for given it a new place 

the guy final take our food order and after take the order say well were out of lobster tuna and scallop wtf it 530 were liter one of the first diner of the even he doesnt offer an explan mb the supplier flake or an apolog just were out of half the menu essenti im more than a littl irrit as these were the item i was most excit about 

whi 3 star the food we did tri was realli good 

risotto with mushroom and manchego tini it tapa but damn good i was scrape the plate 
beef with brie note this has honey and nut all over it i found it scrumptious but mb the idea of a honey cover steak doesnt appeal to everyone
mini chorizo over garlic potato yup as good as it sounds
garl shrimp bore this was a sad substitut for my lobster i want grrr
spanish creme brule  huge and quit good
whit sangria  pack a punch there might be 2 hour of nye that i cant rememb and i blame this sangria

overal it has major potenti but my first dinner here was a bit of a disappoint im excit we have a highend tapa place final so ill definit be back to give it anoth shot but ill probabl give them a few month to get the kink work out review is for lv restaur week 2013 

i have been mean to visit julian serrano for awhil after all for all food connoisseur in las vega sure julian serrano must be somewher on their list tuck away insid the allur aria by the front desk yet ever so far away from park garag is this spot of expens tapa paradis to be of note  it is a tapa place henc whi i havent been on pin and needl tri to come here alway in the back of my mind was the voic say so expens for just tapa just go to firefli instead

luckili lvrw2013 has roll around and i enjoy a meal here with friend on a tuesday night at 630 pm befor be seat my friend and i order cocktail at the bar all 14 i tri a fruiti type drink that provid a nice start to my meal not too sweet not too alcoholi but still pretti steep in price after drink we were seat in the dine area further back which is nice sinc it is over carpet which bring the sound of the clack of feet down to a minimum and it also hide your tabl from the casino chair are plush and comfort light is perfect and the ambianc is classi 

servic was excel our server was prompt kept our drink fill and in general was a veri courteous gentleman i order a chardonnay from the bordeaux region of franc 16 a love wine inde and of the two option anoth which was from california i am glad i splurg worth everi drop  

on to the food

chicken croqueta  simpl yet tasti is the best way to describ these the dish is not the most pleasant to look at but the tast was delici fri on the outsid and creami on the inside

salmon with mash potato and babi carrot  the main dish is what let me down and which brought down my rate the salmon was cook well enough but the portion size was disappoint my friend got the chicken and after see her dish i was wish for chicken also the horseradish cream serv on the side of the salmon just did not go well with the fish to me person i am wish now someon els in my parti had want to do the paella but in order to have that option you must have more than one person order the dish womp womp

molten chocol cake and blood orang ice cream  i do love blood orang ice cream and sorbet and this one was refresh to have with the veri decad and veri good chocol cake if anyth this may have been my favorit part of the dine experi come in second to the glass of chardonnay

overal  i realiz i am review the lvrw2013 menu but even so this food reflect the establish i think the big thing was how flat the salmon fell for me after all it was my main dish while the other item were good i believ they should have been better consid the establish 

would i be back i would tri happi hour i would even go back for a birthday parti i was invit to here or some other special event but i do not believ i would come back for a fullout fullpric meali was lucki enough to meet up here with christina p for lunch yesterday  the menu is current the same as the other beach hous with soft taco burrito and hot dog  they are are plan to add tamal to the regular menu and we got to tri a sampl of pork tamal and it was tasty

i got the three taco for 5 and a lemonad for 3  there are sever flavor of lemonad but i got the plain  i got one each of fish carn asada and chicken  they were all tasti and i tri some of both the green and red sauc on them  one thing i notic is the meat didnt stand out on ani of them and there was veri littl tast differ between the three  all the ingredi were fresh and there was noth soggi  i thought the lemonad was good

they have onli been open a week and of cours the place is spotless  the two employe we dealt with were veri pleasant  i alway carri cash which is a good thing becaus that is all they take  there is an atm in the lobbi  i havent been to their other locat but i am told it is much smaller insid there were 5 2top and some stool with a coupl of tabl outsid too  the tabl would seat 3 or 4 cramp so i think they should have a coupl of addit chairs

overal i see it as a good neighborhood place to grab a quick bite to eat but certain not a destin52710

after read a coupl of review on hillsid spot i decid to check it out myself  besid notic that the line was still long despit it be around 10301045 on a thursday morn i also notic that this place get noisi  i didnt care if it was fullon sun outdoor and alreadi hot i could not and would not bear the nois indoor  and appar a few custom had the same idea bec the onli avail tabl out there were lack umbrella  id give 4 or more star if it wasnt so loud  dont fret though as i found one of the staff was will to set up a tabl w an umbrella all you have to do is ask

i alreadi check the menu onlin for idea so i alreadi knew what i might want to tri  bec of the crowd and the nois that greet me on this first visit which jar me and had me scrambl for some space i wasnt abl to check out the display case and counterspac w their array of pastri cupcak appl pie bytheslic cooki tart muffin and scone which vari daili  do check them out  the appl pie is so so good  the daili special sound good but i decid id tri the croqu madam a croqu monsieur top w a fri egg and the pancak w appl compot  order is at the counter where you pay and take a card to mark your tabl w  it take awhil for your food to be prepar so keep this in mind when you do decid to visit  id say this would be a good time to check out the pastri but depend on how busi hs get you may want to place all of your order select in the begin and get it over w

the croqu madam is simpli outstand  well except for the burnt bit  the french bread from mj bread i believ was just perfect top w a fantast bechamel sauc slice ham melti gruyer chees and a fri egg  this is definit an item i would order again and again

th pancak were good love the batter mix but appl compot this wasnt  ok i admit the compot ive had thus far were fruit reduct that were thick and sweeten from the natur juic as well as ad sugar so perhap hillsid spot appl compot technic qualifi as a compot as defin by dictionarycom fruit stew or cook in a syrup but i found the top as neither sweet nor stew enough the chop appl still had a lot of crunch in them  thank i had my bottl of pure mapl syrup in my purs to sweeten the pancak  

72410
i visit hs for a second time in earli june and tri the berri pancak w homemad whip cream  these were delight  i almost ate the whole thing and had i not tri the appl pie i definit wouldv polish them off  the ad banana perfect ripen took this dish overthetoptri out an unfamiliar cuisin is alway an adventur and my first experi of venezuelan food was a pleasant adventur rand h brian s and i decid to make this our final restaur to tri out for the year 2009 i had the arepa guayan a dish consist of mild chees in a cornbas flatbread i order it bake not fri i also tri the empanada carn esmechada a deepfri turnov fill with savori shred beef both were good and made for quit a fill meal but i couldnt resist tri the quesillo pedaso it was flanlik but much denser  perhap not the most appropri choic of dessert after the relat heavi meal the restaur is veri basic appoint and is tuck in a somewhat hardtofind nook of a commerci shop area seem attach to rosati next door the main sign consist of a notsolarg banner on the facad of the restaur so you might have to look for it a bit but it worth the effortas i was eat my cachapa i couldnt help but think of the absent mind professor and his memor creation flubber  man this thing had a ton of cheesetoo much

not my favorit meal but a great spot to add some intern color and flair to the neighborhoodcame here with my famili for lunch  it averag  

the pad thai 795 was soso  it lack flavor and the noodl had a spongi texture

everyth els was just ok

not worth the drive from scottsdal to mesa

return factor  30connect to the bauer loft and part of the charcoal group that brought waterloo martini wildcraft del dant and the charcoal steakhous you get the diningforthenouveauwaterloo that youd expect i dont mean it deris the atmospher is modern and fresh the menu albeit meatheavi is interest complet with wine pair the servic is matur and the food doesnt disappoint if youv been to wildcraft the vibe is the same 

mi wife and i drop in on a friday night we didnt have a reserv they were fulli book but they were happi to seat us in the bar area with the rest of the illplan 30somethingprofession coupl 

i had the sirloin burger at the recommend of the bartend and it probabl one of the top 3 ive had in waterloo my wife had a halibut steak on top of mix veggi  it was present well and she enjoy it 

the beer select was good  they made the right trade off decis i actual had a laugh when i notic 10 tap 5 typic mainstream select i think canadian blue blue light coor and 5 micro brew select tank hous creemor waterloo dark and a coupl of other 

in general the bk is a safe date work or parent restaur  recommend abov other in the same categori in waterloo sole wildcraft rude nativi attend herb  rye grand open four year ago and it was an interest experi the night start and almost end as one of the worst dine experi ive ever had primarili the servic fortun they took care of us and we end up reloc to the bar and have the complet opposit experi the food was delici and the cocktail were wonder i didnt intent not return but i never end up go back until a coupl month ago

teresa s my fianc and i were in the area and veri hungri so we head over with a reserv via open tabl we were veri excit that we were in time for their happi hour 5pm8pm which meant 50 off select steak and other item what sound better than a 9 oz filet mignon a 17 9 oz filet mignon i also order side of asparagus garlic mash and roast brussel sprout i cant rememb what it was call but it also had panchetta my fianc order the italian sausag flatbread

th side were all veri delici the highlight was definit the brussel sprout ridicul good flavor the asparagus were slight overcook but still good the mash potato were so flavor and creami my steak made me sad it was dri and not medium rare as you can see in the photo there wasnt even a touch of red in the center le sigh i lose all respect for a restaur that cant proper prepar a medium rare steak or burger it the worst offens and total ruin my whole meal which made me more sad sinc i enjoy everyth els so much

servic was spotti as well everyon seem more fixat on the big group in the center of the dine room i guess they were more import anyway although most of the food was realli great it not enough to bring me backso ive been hear about this place for a while for fellow yelper and been want to tri when i final got the chanc we end up have plan to go twice in the same week if my rate was base sole on servic they wouldv got a 15 base on drink 45 base on food 3
mi first time there we were with a veri larg group  30 peopl on a tuesday night at 8pm it not like they didnt know we were come but they seem overwhelm they couldnt keep up with our drink order it took way too long to get the order in let alon get the drink even if it was just bourbon on the rock it took a long time to get our food as well some peopl in our group were done and leav when we didnt even get our food yet they ran out of side brought out side way befor our entre so the side was cold steak were overdon my lobster tail was over cook the food was just  meh we were all happi with the drink select and drinkswhen we got them
i was turn off with that first tri but i gave them a pass sinc it was such a larg group and went back with some friend on friday night around 730 again servic was horribl it took forev to get our drink order and it was near imposs to get the waiter attent if you want anyth els onc we order food the food also took forev i got the calamari this time and the first time and it was good both time i also got a prosciutto and asparagus flatbread it was good noth excit but good my husband steak was much better this time and his side broccoli and chees was yummi a friend at our tabl never got his food when we were all done eat so he cancel his order my drink were perfect order 2 drink at a time becaus they take so long to get brown derbi and blinker both good in their own way it was our friend birthday so we all split some donutsthey were awesome
i like the decor and old fashion vibe ive been to this local befor it was herb and ryeboy has it chang 
the servic alon would keep me from go back not sure if i will go back onli time will tell good thing they have some loyal yelper as patron becaus they turn off a room full of peoplthe cup is a pretti fanci coffe spot in the middl of the shop area of citi center the color are all orang and bright and the price tag of the food and drink match both the décor and the locat in other word it expensive

but it also nice to have a coffe shop in a citi that doesnt seem to have mani and it nice that they have so mani bake good which is also lack in most of the coffe place ive been to along the strip while i didnt tri the coffe here becaus id alreadi had two cup earlier i did appreci their cold beverag select which includ ginger beer and aluminum small bottl of coke and coke zero

i found myself a littl hungri here too and was abl to pick up a littl savori pastri i cant rememb what it was call but it was basic spinach wrap in filo dough and bake until it was flaki and delici i devour it and was sate but i would definit tri the other varieti they had base on this onethe skinni better than your averag sandwich shop with a nicer ambienc but not much more than that 3 servic we appar hit the cafe around 100 but it still took 10 minut for us to get our order down and we were the first one in line 2 valu it not bad  around 67 for a decent sandwich howev it not worth the drive to come here and eat 3

this place obvious cater to the offic build nearbi given it remot locat hidden by the tower adjac structur we wander in while the suit were get their fix of illi coffe with lunch

first of all despit it monik this place has noth to do with baguett we order two sandwich  one ham and chees and one press panini with a curri chicken filling

th bread is more of a ciabattatyp affair  a 6 inch loaf with a dens textur and a littl mildi unpleas hard chewi crust this is not the light center loav with the pleasant crust that i was anticipating

th ingredi insid the sandwich were veri good  the slice of chicken in the curri sandwich was suffici moist and tender while the sauc was pleasant the ham and chees sandwich was made with fresh ingredi albeit the bread was onli okay for me 

i was a littl struck by how disorgan the peopl in the back were  there were three sandwich makersserv in the back that were look for direct from the cashier who i believ is the owner this unfortun was suffici distract enough plus he took a phone order in the interim that it took about 10 minut for us to place our orders

yeah  this place serv a better sandwich than your averag place but is it someth to go back for or drive across town im not so sure 3 stari have been excit for the grand open sort of a let down good thing i was in a who care attitud today 

first a littl histori these meat head start the whole chain and franchis out they still own peoria and phoenix but have either sold or franchis out the rest 

the place was busi and there were plenti of peopl work most had no idea what they were do lol 

i brows the menu and decid that the kid meal would suffic for lunch sinc there are no lunch special i ask the order taker if the kid meal come with a meatbal she said yes but then ask if i want a drink which it come with it i knew there was not go to be a meatbal 

the littl dude with an earring and michael jordan short on said to me is it for a kid i said yes i am a big kid he said to no longer order from the kid menu without it be for a child then proceed to tell the order taker never let it happen again lol azz

th same dude made it a point to serv me the food it was a perfect lunch size portion of spag with meat sauc no meatbal and two of the best garlic rollsknot whatev i have had in a long time  the sauc was good but it got a littl water down by the pasta not be drain enough i see qualiti is not a high point here 

the other plate look great and i look forward to tri someth els off  the kid menuthis is the perfect locat for me and my sister to meet inbetween and we did befor she left for ethiopia we gave it a tri and i was stoke becaus i love lunch at caff boa in temp i was hope boa bistro would have the same spark 

but sad it was all just hmm and we left a littl confus 

we split the mufaletta and this salad that sound amaz but when it was put on the tabl we both were like huh

it was the chicken almond someth salad someth about california mayb it was present veri odd and didnt look anyth like i pictur it from the descript the chicken was bland and the dress was bland it was unexpect in a i wish we order someth els way 

the mufaletta was good but mayb we were just so bum about the salad 

it wasnt gross or anyth it just didnt sound as good as the descript everyth was fresh and clean just sooooflavorless 

our waiter told us it was all delici but he is obvious a liar or hasnt tast the entir menu

th patio was great and so was the tea mayb well give it anoth shot the next time we meet for lunch and tri someth elsim take my rate down a star on the hot dog stop the price of a special has gone up about  a buck sinc my last review so it now about 704 but the price increas is not the main reason im bust these guy down a notch 

the bun have taken a turn for the wors and fall apart plus what realli irk me is that they keep the front door open when it cold outsid i know i should be a littl heartier be from chicago but when your eat with a short sleev shirt on it get uncomfort i have wit other patron close the door and within a coupl of minut the worker open up the door again

th foot long hot dog are good occasion ill have the chicken dog which is fabul that chicken dog is avail sporadthe classic exampl of whi we need half star  doesnt merit a four star endors but slight better than the three star meh  the hot dog are decent but youd expect more due to the pedigre of the owner  the place also doesnt feel well put togeth and like it been neglect in recent timewent back at an off time avoid the sushi complet and it was a complet differ good experi we use a groupon on a coupl 2 item combo and soft shell crab appet the combo includ a ton of food i think their garlic chicken is even better than island sushi sinc it spicier 

food was quick and servic attent but dont bother with the soft shell crab if your do ala cart it not worth 9 for 2 teeni crab write this i actual just realiz that when we did ayc last time they said they were out of soft shell crab for appet but we got spider roll so theyr liar too nice 

i will still never be back for their sushi or attempt the frustrat of go there for dinner but id probabl go back for the garlic or mochiko chicken entrei had an analog all readi about burrito and how it imposs to get them too wrong but my intern censor decid it was a littl risqu for a famili websit so youll just have to use your imagination

anyway the upshot is that there a limit to how low you can reason score a place like illeg jack  it sell burrito nacho and other assort fauxmexican delight  what not to like

wel it ok  but compar to place like los cardo in leith or pinto in glasgow who do this sort of thing realli well the shortcom of illeg jack becom clear

your £650 add more if you want a nonveggi fill and more again if you want someth as extravag as a bit of sour cream buy you a flour tortilla fill with a slight sloppi mixtur of rice bean and your fill and salsa of choic and option extra like jalapenoschees etc

it a formula that work well elsewher but here the whole thing end up be a littl bit bland and flavourless which is realli the onli unforgiv sin when it come to mexican food  im not some insan chillihead with an asbesto tongu but i found myself have to make liber use of the hot  sauc to tri and liven thing up a bit

it a nice enough place though  servic has been good whenev ive been in  a slight downward adjust in price and upward adjust in flavour should be all it take to add at least one extra star to the review031210

four star for the food and atmospher but i deduct a star for the servic  i was to meet a coupl of friend for happi hour here but i arriv almost two hour befor they did  he was wait to get off work and had to swing by to pick up his wife and i was get hungri  they knew this so it wasnt an issu  

as you can see it been two month sinc our visit so i forgot the name of the awesom server that was first assign to me silli me i know but i can say that it was a name of hispan origin  howev i do rememb quit well the name of the server that took over our parti a fave gemston of mine sinc my origin server was assign to work the patio  we all consid leav but my friend had heard a few yelper and me talk tmi up a few day befor at the yelp in bloom event and want to check out the ale and food

ok onto the food

i came to check out the happi hour app menu which i sad found doe not exist  while there are beverag discount dure happi hour the list isnt veri long  i understand that there onli one or two wine by the glass on it as well as one or two draft ale  i think he tri the oak creek nut brown thumb down and two glass of the white rascal thumb up  anoth testimoni to the subpar servic show us by thatwhogoesbyajewelsmonik is that he was overcharg by not one but two beer select  it alway a good idea to check your receipts

so what did i eat  i had the terrif rb  c made w roast beef muenster chees and horseradish sauc on a baguett  if you havent alreadi done so you must run at this veri moment to tmi and order one  everyth about this sandwich as well as the side salad that accompani it was faultless  from the delici aromat crusti baguett melti muenster ampl portion of roast beef cook to juici perfect and the divin horseradish sauc i was in thunderbolt citi with everi sapor bite  it was a battl of willpow vs a basal desir for full sensori gratif  willpow won my mom abl to enjoy the other halfsandwich later that night but onli becaus i was go to order the artichok heaven a dip which consist of atichok heart and a blend of three chees to share with my friend they had it w lt chip and i had mine w crostini and housefri potato chip  this dish went over well  definit a mustorderagain select  friend select were the griddl chees and housemad salsa and lt chip  both sandwich and salsa were veri tasti  fyi my friend had a hard time tri to order a tequila sunris  first our server wasnt familiar with the cocktail  second we were told by our server that the barkeep did not know what it was either  after a few minut and by then i start ask if i could get a sidecar no a bartend final came up and said that they lack the grenadin to make a ts  no on the sidecar bec they didnt carri lemon juic  thought i should mention this

p  i just rememb when i first arriv and sat in the main dine area of tmi i was onli one of mayb three peopl sit there  i found the music to be disconcert loud  i cant recal if i put in a request for the level to be lower  by the time my friend arriv it was busier out in the patio and in the main dine room wed move to the communiti tabl next to the bar area and we were practic shout at each other as we tri to carri on a convers  not ideal  at least not for me

fyi i heard from matt d the owner that eight draft beer two wine by the glass and all cocktail are discount dure happi hour  ill have to go back soon and see if theyll make a revis sidecar for me use lime juici came here with some fellow outoftown yelper after read the buzz here on yelp and the restaur websit let just say that it wasnt at all what i expected

th websit proclaim  culinari dropout is go to be a realli fun cool and casual chefdriven gastropub

gastropub i think not tri gastroclub tm

instead of a casual lowkey bar that also serv great food cd is more like a club where the music is more import than the food certain the blare music dampen ani culinari excit i had when we walk in the door we could bare hear the hostess as she told us it would be an hour wait we put our name down anyway saw that the bar was pack and then escap outsid to wait

eventu we grab seat at the outsid bar where two other patron had just polish off two platter of oyster no fewer than three server came to ring up bill and chat while we sat right there in front of them with the platter and dirti silverwar pile up but nobodi bother to greet us or clear the plate until about 10 minut later by the time the bartend was readi to take our order we got call for our tabl and reenter the restaurant

w were seat at a fourtop just in front of the stage where a musician start play a short time later not surpris we had a hard time carri on our convers instead we buri our head in the menu which offer a promis varieti of eclect dish our tabl went with the onion soup artichok salad fri chicken butternut squash cannelloni and kurobuta pork rib 

ill admit the food was good the artichok salad was refresh crisp shave of artichok heart asparagus and endiv mix with some frise and a slight sweet vinaigrett my fri chicken was excel although i initi thought it look burnt due to it mahogani color the meat was succul the coat was just a touch spici with a hint of cayenn nice crisp and also drizzl with some honey everybodi els enjoy their food as well it was the servic that continu to be a problem 

our waitress although attent at first disappear after she took our order other server brought our food to us which was probabl the reason that we receiv onli one order of salad split wed want one order to be split between two of us and anoth order for the person who was onli have soup and salad when onli two bowl of salad were deliv two of us share one of them later while we were eat our entre yet anoth server tri to drop off anoth bowl of salad but we wave it off think it wasnt our suspici howev this bowl was twice as big as the other wed receiv we flag our waitress over to ask for water and silverwar and explain what happen she promis wed onli be charg for one salad yet when the bill came we were charg for two again we had to explain that wed onli receiv the split orderand final the lightbulb went on or flicker after consult the kitchen to confirm what happen she redid our bill and apologized

would i eat here again no not unless it was for lunch becaus i cant imagin it would be as pain loud then the food was good and the servic issu can be work out but the concept seem confus even though the dimlylit decor featur chair you might find in a pub and leather banquett the overal vibe was far from publik if your okay with a noisi gastroclub instead of an intim gastropub go ahead and come here becaus the food seem worth ita solid 35 star for my first visit if that were an option  when 5th and wine dare to close over memori weekend my friend and fellow yelper christina p suggest cd as an alternative

tri to grasp onto those last few day of toler temp we sat outsid and drink order were taken prompt  i went with the camelback cooler  i want to love it but it was a miss for me  i want it to be a littl sweeter and more orangey  instead it was on the bitter side  cocktail number two was the clown punch  this was the hit for me  the pomegran foam on top was unexpect well not realli sinc it list on the menu and fun

w all share the soft pretzel and provolon fondu  i could tri everyth on their menu and im pretti sure that would still be a favorit for me  but who doesnt love bread and chees  i also tri the pork belli cubano although christina forewarn me it realli ham not pork belli  mayb that whi the restaur is call culinari dropout  whatev the hell it was it was realli good too

although the scottsdal waterfront is not necessarili my favorit place to be i can see myself enjoy cd everi now and then  i can also see that 4th star with anoth trii have a loveh relationship with this place if i place the order for pick up or deliveri sometim the wait is much much longer then they say it will be  i have been left wait insid for up to 40 minut and wait almost 2 and a half hour this last time we order for deliveri we actual cancel that order and got a refund  this would be the hate part of the relationship

now the love part the food is pretti good there are certain item i have order that i wouldnt and other i order each time like the fri veggi dumpl you get 8 in an order and they are addict the egg roll are bigger then im use to i can get a 2 piec order of those and eat some dumpl and rice and be stuf 

i have alway order onlin i have onli call when check the status of my order  the onlin order is veri conveni and they have a area where you can out extra instruct 

the orang chicken onli come in larg size on the menu but if you order it from the kid menu you can get the small portion if you still want the larger portion then you might want to order the combin dinner meal with the orang chicken becaus then you will get a choic of soup rice an egg roll and a crab rangoon for 895 and the orang chicken alon is 855 might as well get more for your meal for just 40 cent moreveri nice atmospher dark wall w furnish in deep brown and burgundi tone  love the plush rail at the bar veri comfort   cool tune and while i realli like how it was veri easi to convers w the next person in the begin of my stay here even the peopl across from us could hear what we were say by the end of the even the music did get louder  the cocktail menu look great but the price made me balk

mabel happi hour menu also featur greatsound app  a coupl across from us recommend the pork belli  while i cant even bring myself to imagin swallow pillow of pork belli fat which will eventu becom pillow of belli fat on me  i do see other propiti optioni love you pita jungl but on this particular occas you werent fire on all cylind 

have onli been one other time i decid to order my usual it probabl not usual if i onli had it onc huh well i decid to order what i had last time how about that spici chicken bean rice a slew of veggi all wrap up in some wheat pita figur id enjoy it as much as i did last time but not so much it was a littl off unlik last time when the veggi were crisp and i could differenti between them this was a pita full of mush and i could bare get through half befor i chuck it it had good flavor and in pjs defens i took it to go so mayb someth is lost dure carryout in ani case it was good enough that ill be back and mayb next time ill make sure to eat in

know befor you go

if your take it to go call in your order it was a zoo when i was there and i had to wait close to twenti minutsad this dee will be close it door on april 1st 2014 i honest hope it will be some sort of april fool trickeri and they will remain open but judg by the guy face when ask about their final day he look fair stoic if not rather forlorn  so on april 1st i will rais my singl origin cappuccino and take a sip in honor of dee and how their close will make that particular outdoor plaza that much less sweeter  literi was stoke to hear about a new delisandwich shop in the area so we pop in on the weekend for lunch 

i order up a small eggsalad sandwich and tera went with a small turkey sandwich the deli proud proclaim boar head meat with signag plaster all over

neith of us were particular impress tera whole wheat roll was a bit firm but my white roll was just fine i enjoy my sandwich but it just didnt seem like that great of a valu 579 for my lil sandi 579 for tera sandi a bottl of arizona ice tea a small side of pasta salad and our total was about 20

i dig that each sammich come with a small bag of wise potato chip hail from pa where i grew up 

ill probabl go back to tri their veggi sandwich at some point but im in no hurri for mani of the folk who work up in this area im sure rinaldi is a welcom addit to the dine option in this localthis is a clean place with a few tvs around you order your food and they call your number when it readi they have a pretti divers menu so there probabl someth for everyone

i had a late lunch and order one of the special chicken parmesan sandwich it was okay but noth to write home about ive been in there for breakfast as well the breakfast sandwich are good but can be a littl priceylife is all about creat a balanc this idea translat to a restaur with it element of food servic and decor

th gourmet taco shop la condesa is still tri to find it own equilibrium but the line of custom near out the door isnt give the new establish much of a chance

la condesa is locat on 16th street just north of mcdowel in a neighborhood that no stranger to tasti mexican food includ torta el guero and the popular barrio cafe

with no shortag of good mexican food how doe a new place stand out they do thing their own way

youl notic strike artwork on the wall the art is beauti lit and from a visual standpoint it hard to look away that until you see the salsa bar

onc you place your order at the counter your given a number then have a seat and a staffer will deliv a basket of crunchi chip this is when the fun begin tap that salsa bar

on each of my visit the salsa line up was never quit the same with at least six to choos from standout includ an avocado salsa that was vibrant and flavor the chunki salsa mexicano and the creami cilantro salsa

if you run out of chip they will refil your basket but tri not to fill up on chip while you wait for your food becaus you will inde wait and wait and wait on each of my visit the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minut to deliv my order but dont let this discourag you becaus some thing are worth wait for

th taco are serv on two 6inch corn tortilla you can order taco ala cart 299 each or as a two taco plate 699 with rice and beans

th beer batter cabo shrimp version was hot and fresh yet perfect crunchi while leav the shrimp moist and tender the sonoran carn asada had a great flavor but was more like jerki tough and dry

burrito were most a miss while pay a premium 729 you can choos shrimp or mahi mahi mine were fill with too much rice and not enough seafood

howev the mayan cochinita pibil burro 699 was an absolut killer fill with luscious roast pork shoulder it was so tender you dont need teeth to eat it

th handmad cornquesa is go to bring me back they take fluffi corn masa and fold it around your select of fill then use their deep fri to creat a uniqu and substanti altern to taco and burritos

b a purist the tradit quesa 549 was one of my favorit simpli fill with gooey oaxaca cheese

th same oaxaca chees is pair with the earthi flavor of mushroom in the maria sabina quesa 699

for me the thing to order is the azteca tinga quesa 729 stuf with shred chicken tomato onion and chipotl sauc the flavor were complex and each bite was sheer bliss

servic is friend and on some night you might even see the owner kid help outat first i thought i was in a nurseri everi tabl in these cramp quarter had an infant with stroller and babi seat cri and whine i hate our societi now that this is accept behavior of bring your cri babi to restaur how about take that kid outsid for a stroll like a respons adult than total ignor them and put us through this stress situat your just wait for me to snap right 
well back to the review
food was fresh uniqu authent plus plus plus salsa were plenti yes tri them all but im a foodi and i need flavor though i thought it a bit on the bland side for my tast ill instead rave about them be uniqu and not your ordinari mexrestaur the night we went there was a line and busi and they do treat you as familyfriend anoth plus but mayb too crowd we had the center tabl and everyon server and patron jam right in there 
i order up the sonora carn asada burrito it say a charbroil mesquit arrachera steak with homemad bean unsur what arrachera steak is but gobbl it up with extra salsa from the buffet jodi had the fish taco and well they smell fishi not the best either one of us ever had but was now check off our bucket list mission completeasili a 4 star restaur and experi if we didnt get a sucki waitress

ughhh my friend and i were so hyph to tri this place becaus i had it bookmark and the portion are huge  after find the secret elev to the restaur we walk in on a friday afternoon and it wasnt too busi  most of the tabl were fill but we were seat right away  know that this was our first time i didnt mind have a littl extra time for us all to look over the menu  howev can you explain to me whi it took 15 minut for our waitress to come i had to speak to the hostess and tell her to go get someon  the hostess return a few minut later to take our drink order becaus our waitress appar told her to and then she left  a few minut after that here come our waitress to take our drink order ummmm yea the hostess just did that yea she told me you guy order alcohol drink so i have to take the order or you couldv just did that to begin with now i realli need my drink

w also gave her our food order becaus we were starv and were not about to wait anoth 15 minut to come back with our drink and then take our food order  look around the restaur i notic that everi other tabl was be help by their waiterswaitress in a time matter so it couldnt have been that they were swamp dang whi couldnt we have had one of them we all thought  three of us decid to share the open face pot pie and the chicken and waffl  we knew the food would be ginorm shoot it was 15 a plate  our other friend got some chicken dish which i cant rememb the name but i suuuur got a pictur of it  final we get our food and the plate were massiv i couldnt wait to dig in

ohhh the pot pie was soooo good  i like how it had mash potato hidden behind the crust to tri with the fill  the chicken and waffl were also good as good as rosco  all i need was some hot sauc  these waffl had bacon bake in them ohhh let me unbutton my pant and dig in  wait  we need plate to share these massiv meal and some extra syrup  we manag to let the waitress know befor she left look around for waitress after 10 minut realli realli she just goe mia  we flag down a bus boy to grab us some plate and syrup and it was no problem for him a few miut later he came back with everyth  10 minut after he did so did our waitress  what is wrong with you woman

i swear we had to have other peopl pick up her slack and she had the nerv to blame someon els when we ask her to bring sometth and she then realiz waaay later we didnt have it  our meal was 70 and she onli got a 3 tip

i wouldnt mind go back to hash hous actual we all wouldnt  but were put the brake on that waitress if we get stuck with her againi came here for one thing and one thing onli the chicken and waffl i was sold after see the pictur it was the 1 thing i had to get when i was in vega 

littl did i know that they did not serv it on their late menu i got sooooooooooo fuck piss that my gf knew i was be like a kid and throw a tantrum what a fail 

i had to make the best out of it so i decid i end up get the indiana favorit which came with andi sage fri chicken 2 egg bacon mash potato and a biscuit 

the fri chicken was awesom perfect made and so moist it wasnt all greasi like the chicken you would get from kfc if you like bacon you will love the mash potatoesth gfs blueberri pecan flapjack was delici and pretti humong 

their 1 lb angus burger look mighti tempt also as i saw a few tabl order them 

one of my favorit beer is offer here arrog bastard in a 24 oz bottl gotta love that 

last i hate how this hash hous locat is at imperi palac this casino is just a complet fail ghetto as hell serious do i have to take 23 differ elev just to get to the casino next time im head to 2nd hash hous locat for my chicken and waffl 

there you have it 2 review in onewarn anoth reason whi i miss san diego

i like this hash hous a gogo conveni locat on the las vega blvd strip on the secondfloor of the imperi palac hotel and casino 

i like the bigger venu of this hh las vega locat with no wait in the morn 

i like the later close hour at 11pm

there is a fullservic bar 

there is keno and a big screen televis for sport event  

but the food tast like ani other casino diner if not worst than the san diego hillcrest locat 

for 1695 i had the crispi hammer pork tenderloin the dish had a long piec of a crispi pork cutlet on top of a biscuit bbq cream sauc scrambl egg tomato and spinach 

mi meal httpwwwyelpcombizphotosf4x1ybxklrzg652xt2kr5gselectfrwio4konjv9o279ssykag

thi is a veri big dish but the dish tastewis was just ok like i aforement it tast like an overpr casino food 

i also had 600 glass of mimosa at least they use fresh squeez oj along with champagn in this drink 

mi drink httpwwwyelpcombizphotosf4x1ybxklrzg652xt2kr5gselectth5sj4h8ey8rxzpgzzphiq

i still love san diego locat and food much better but las vega has two other locat unfortun this touristi part of lv is not my favorit 

on the bright side i might return again and mayb redeem myself and tri someth els insteadblueberri pecan flapjack that is all

of cours it wasnt name hash hous for it flapjack so i guess im gonna recommend tri the hash as well portion are huge enough to share servic was good our server mark was veri attent although i didnt like how he brought the bill over when we werent even halfway through our meal

go right after it open at 8am it get pretti busi even for a weekday
you can get total reward point for eat herewe were so excit to tri this icon indiana eateri  locat at the back of the quad resort  casino a escal plop you right in front of the eatery

w tri the signatur sage fri chicken benedict a hh ginorm blue berri pancak and a pistachio ice mocha  okay first off the portion are huge  one pancak is probabl enough for at least three peopl  my benedict was gigant as well but consist of mash potato biscuit tomato mozzarella scrambl egg fri chicken and a pink countri gravi the flavor combin was a littl too muddl for my like  i can easili see the sage chicken and waffl stack as be much better  the pancak itself was tasti but it was so huge it was on the dri side also they need to serv this thing with a pitcher of syrup and lot of butter instead of the singl scoop and tini cup it came with

mi pistachio ice mocha was veri good and even better after i stir up the whip cream to add some addit sweet to the drink  i could defin tast pistachio

ov all i think we need to come back here and tri the chicken waffl stack and mayb a stuf burger to give a fair review but for now i rate this as 3 starsolid 35

this place is brand new it is a market and a great place for lunch

mi review is for lunch only

gyro 599
frys and drink 250
total 922

the place is clean and has plenti of help everyon is extrem nice and helpful

th food was averag the pita was warm and the gyro meat was good it is cook on a spit the tzatziki sauc was thin and not too flavor i have had better
fri were a thicker type and had a littl season on them they give enough for two to share

th salad look good as did the plate type of meal 

i will go back but may skip the fri and drinkthe littl engin that could should offer a lesson to the temp farmer market becaus it isnt what is claim to be asid from the token produc stand the token honey stand and the token oliv oil stand this place realli doesnt have a leg on which to stand that a shame but that a colleg town 

when i found out this farmer market has been exist for about four week i was truli disappoint in the turnout becaus a dozen vendor do not a farmer market make while there is a great potenti for this to be a great destin i question whether or not tempedowntown temp at thati an appropri locat for such a market ill keep my judgment to myself in the meantim and continu to shop here at least there are altern shop abroadthis place has been here for over 25 year they have had good time and bad time right now must be a good time 

the place look great fresh and clean 
the servic was ok but the manag dude was great 
the food was good and they have some decent choic now 

we had a fish plate with 2 big filet slaw frys and hush puppi i had 2 fish taco and lobster bite 

the plate was share by both kid and they eat the major of it and like it i had the taco and while there are no good fish taco in az these did alright i would prefer not so crusti bread though the lobster bite are fantast but be sure to share them as the butter flavor get a littl over power and gross after 15 or so 

over all it is better the mcdonald and cheaperim surpris i had never eaten at el pollo loco  but jeff lewi seem pretti fond of it either that or el pollo loco pay him extrem amount of money to eat it on the show  and i love that show so i thought i might love el pollo loco too

i went with the twice grill chicken burrito not sure if the twice grill part refer to grill the chicken twice or grill the chicken onc and then grill the burrito  it was the latter  anywho fill with chicken breast pico sour cream guac and a littl chees it was quit tasti and probabl pretti healthi wouldnt you think  i like that you get a littl bag of tortilla chip with your order  also sampl the black bean but they were a barbequ bean not my thing

it was fun to see strawberri soda on the fountain too which i had to have much to my husband horror  this from the man who drink orang soda routin  

the restaur was reason clean but my shoe stuck to the floor perhap from someon els sicken sweet strawberri soda  it was a nice chang to have your order brought to the tabl  i hate the linger at the counter you get at most fast food restaurants

too bad my somewhat healthi burrito had 796 calori and 39g of fat  while i might return to el pollo loco if conveni i wouldnt go out of my way for that kind of nutrit  i would opt for a insert nameberto burrito instead

and btw you can catch the new season of flip out tuesday on bravo  now that use informmeh  the onli closer pizza place to my hous are littl caeser and rush street pizza

 tri rush street and it doesnt cut it littl caeser that is onli for littl kid birthday parti and gather of high school kid when you need a bunch of pizza cheap

if i go anoth 5 mile or so i can get grimaldi good but pricey or venezia also good but pricey

so what do you knowpizza hut get a tri with the 599 medium pizza with up to three toppings

it was better than i expect i must say i didnt expect much thoughit is not as good as it use to be when the origin owner ran the joint for sure you can tell that by the lack of busi they have these day back in the day there were alway a few famili at the tabl and the deliveri guy was in and out  constant that is no longer the case 

we went last week and just got some burrito  carn asada and machaca both were good giant burrito like you expect from ani of the berto place around town i prefer their carn asada to other in the vicin so well probabl go back but it is definit becom a hit and miss oper im not sure they will be around for the long haul

on day i may have to journey up to anthem to check out the new place the old owner opened

also if you are from san diego  take note that this place offer a veri similar menu to those roberto but it is not the same you will know right away it not when you see the hot saucto put it succinct the servic at mijana border on the comic absurd  

befor weav this narrat i will disclaim that it blow my mind that after year of be in busi and countless review attest to the subpar servic that there has been littl to no improv in that department

our parti arriv for intern night at 7p on a sunday night  the second sunday of each month this restaur host a few performersact from vari part of the world  tonight we got to enjoy brazilian samba egyptian bellyd and spanish flamenco  the entertain was wonderful

upon our arriv the restaur was less than half empti  i notic three server and the managerown in attend  as we were seat we immedi ask for a high chair for our toddler  that high chair arriv about an hour and a half later   it probabl took 15 minut befor we receiv menus  no drink order were taken no water brought to the tabl  they arriv about a half hour later

foul moudama fava bean cook with garlic and lemon juic top fresh dice tomato cilantro with drizzl of oliv oil love this fresh and pack with flavor

i had to get up and get more bread for our dip as server was nowher to be seen  i had to constant clear the tabl of plate as no one came to the tabl to do so  at one point about an hour and fifteen minut after we arriv the owner came to the tabl to ask how the food was  the music was so loud i was virtual scream at him and i bare heard him  i hand him a stack of plate that i was just clear from the tabl and mention how the food tast great but we were all still hungryhint hint

th server never came to follow up on our food to ask if we want refil or just to see how everyon was do  around 830p one hour after our order were place i had to onc again get up and find the server to ask about the remain dish i order  at that time she inform me that they were out of two of the appet i order  no sambusek no makanek  no apolog  fine but the appropri thing to do would have been to come to the tabl and inform us about this and offer someth els instead  long stori short she mention that my chicken shawarma hummus was on it way more than an hour after i order it  the final appet i order would arriv an hour and fifteen minut after order was placed

hummus shawarma chicken over hummus with pine nut my favorit dish of the night tast exact like pita jungl version  just cost more  the chicken was outstand  soft succul and savori  

garlic shrimp sauté shrimp in garlic cilantro  second favorit dish  generous portion of gorgeous plump prawn well season and veri flavorsome

i was on my way back to my car when i spot tea time across the street so i went in to check thing out  color and dainti porcelain tea set flagstaff honey jar and other teamak and teadrink accessori mingl on wall shelv and stand on the main floor while file drawer reminisc of old laboratori and classroom contain tea cut line the wall behind the cashier counter  sharon the rep work tonight was person enough and let me know she would be happi to let me take a whiff of whatev tea varieti i fanci  i was abl to sniff a few coconut black with visibl toast coconut flake mix in ginger coconut green rooibo coconut macaroon with herb and other addit ingredi that sharon did not have the info to share with me and even stevia leaf cut befor settl on the ginger coconut see as it was caffeinefre  otherwis id have gone for the caffein coconut black  but befor i settl with that choic i did get to sampl a gingerberri blend tea from a cute clear honey pot dispens across the counter along one of the wall which i found to tast similar to a juici fruit gum that has lost most of it sweet flavor  when i final was abl to tast a few sip from the 22 oz ice rooibo 350 as i was walk toward my car i was disappoint to find that it tast just like the ginger berry

i notic sign on all three twotop garden tabl and chair set line the center of the store where custom could sit and have tea advertis easter saturday high tea reserv avail 15 per person50 for a tabl of four with the first five parti who do reserv will receiv a gift from the store as a token of appreci for attend  this sound interest i was think of take my cousin but sharon didnt know who the cater were for the event so i stop consid the possibility

whil i like the idea of the store and it offer local honey tea set and pot made in england and japan rather than china id rather patron tea shop and onlin merchant that offer handrol loos tea leav that look like whole leav curl into pearl and other definit shape rather than almostpowd cut  i would like to return and tri anoth varieti befor shrug off tea time for good i want to give this review two star but it seem a bit harsh  perhap i just chose the wrong tea to tri tonight  i hope my next visit will yield more info and better tastings

congrat to tea time for reach it fiveyear anniversari  may you have anoth fivesome 3 star are better than other 3 star  that becaus the yelp wont give us half star or quarter star  or ani portion of star  no stardust either  i did get some pixi dust at a yelp event onc but that is a complet differ stori than i am not prepar to relat today

al i am prepar to tell you today is that we had dinner at flame kabob 2  it was overal pretti good  we start with flame chees we felt that with the word flame in the name of the restaur we need someth flame and we couldnt get certain friend to join us so we had to order burn food  actual burn food  the chees was serv fajita style that is on a small skillet with a wooden holder  it was veri tasti but rather greasi  what did i expect from burn cheese

w follow that with a coupl share entre  a gyro platter and some kind of chicken platterim afraid i dont rememb the name  both were tasti  the chicken was heavili sauc havent we all been onc or twice and flavor strong with garlic havent we all been onc or twice

so to bottom line this for you dont we all just want to go straight for the bottom sometim  the bottom line  i would eat here againafter walk in i want to be abl to give more than 3 star i realli did  it a cute clean but tini place that complet beli the strip mall location

th good my fresh berri crepe were wonder  two crepe stuf full and top with a night light crème fraîch  and the berri truli were fresh  delect  my wife enjoy the pancak though they were not especi notabl beyond that  good size and done as expected

th cramp i did mention this place was tini right  yeah we were squeez in to a tabl next to a hutch that had the silent radio and cookbook and a littl display  the radio was turn on a littl after we got there which did warm up the place a bit but couldnt cover that we were liter twist to stay in our seat and not bump our neighbor while eat  it will like get better if they can get a coupl tabl outsid as the temp drop but for now ill skip if there not elbow room

th place doe have some charm and ill be back to see how it matur and to tri the eponym dishquit a while back i found out pomegran cafe was come to ahwatuke and i was pretti stoke be that there realli isnt much in the way of vegetarian fare around here i join the mail list and anxious anticip their opening

wel i never got ani kind of notif that they open which seem weird but whatev 

i end up stumbl across pc on the way to star of india for lunch the other day and i was stoke final i pop in ask for a togo menu but they didnt have one oh okay well is your menu onlin nope everyth is season so we dont updat hmmmm okay mayb ill check back after lunch

so we pop back in to grab a coffe after some indian grub the menu look good and they have vegan pastri right on ill go with the soy coconut latt and dalli g went with some ice spici chai tea thing well we wait 12 minut to get our drink even though there were onli two other custom there and what a disappoint my latt was so bland and his tea was just wrong

i wasnt pleas with the actual place weird setup and incred uninvit neither of our drink tast good the wait was excess and it was definit up there cost wise

pc  i unfortun think you are strike out hope there are enough self conscious soccer mom in ahwatuke to keep you go becaus i love the idea it just fall flat

sorrithe pomegran café was recent name best new restaur by phoenix magazin which is a lifestyl rag for urbanit with dollar to burn  the restaur in question is in chandler home to mani of these people

howev pomegran café is familyown and veganfriend so i had to check it out  everyth on the menu is vegetarian and can be made vegan  there are also glutenfre and raw option so there someth for everybodi  

the restaur serv breakfast food like tofu scrambl french toast and breakfast burrito but when i went i chose a vegan blt from their lunch menu  it was made with delici smoki tempeh bacon and the addit of avocado was nice  my hot date order a pesto sandwich which he declar pasti but tasti  neither sandwich was huge but they come with a spinachpomegran salad and some veggi chip  you get a full plate of food and everyth is extrem fresh but i wasnt too stoke on the salad though my hot date like it  it would have been nice to have a choic of side like some fri or potato salad or someth but that was not the case

w also split a berri smoothi which was pretti tasti  it was no tsoynami butwhat is  they also had a good select of vegan dessert such as cooki donut hole cake and even cheesecak  we got a slice of chocol cake top with pomegran seed to go and it was delici  it so rare to find dairi and eggfre desserts

th atmospher was bright clean and cheer  it was an enjoy meal for sure  my main gripe about the place bring me right back to my first paragraph everyth was sooo damn expens  sandwich are 812 the smoothi was friggin 7 and the slice of cake was 6  

so if you wanna splurg and tri a new vegan place on the far east side of town it definit worth a tri  but unless your one of those rich peopl that can afford thing you might want to bring a friend and split some stuff  the food is tasti but i dont think ill go back becaus i wouldnt dream of spend that kind of money on a meal these dayit like watch an episod of cheaters

or listen to talk radio

or pee out by the dumpster becaus it quicker than find a bathroom

or go through the medicin cabinet at my friend houperhap ive overshared

but you get the idea 

it a guilti pleasureok im not sure pleasur and church realli go togeth unless you realli like roll around in chicken fat like i dooop overshar againmor of a guilti thing

at ani rate i know i shouldnt but there are time when onli a bucket or in church case a box of greasi fri chicken will do

and when that happen wellit church instead of the 11 herb and spice that theoret go into kfc or kitchen fresh chickenor kentucki fri chicken or whatev the hell they call themselv these days

a bunch of peopl show up for dinner tonight and church is the goto for that kind of thing at least it is when they all suggest i cook and i say thank no and they give me the eeew face when i suggest pizza

a the consumm host i remind my guest that churchs

   has never given me the trot unlik kfcimport sinc it my hous and me light a match is optional

  is less expens than kfc sinc im buy the feast

  goe well with pretti much ani wine ok i made this last one up but i figur they wont notic onc they have drunk enough of my wine

so churchsperfect averag fri chicken for cheap low prices

dont even tri to tell me that you havent done it tooquick servic but not full starbuck product avail they had a limit number of drink  i guess that ok as they were locat insid the convent center

long line all the time the best time to go was earli morn  a littl after they open when there wasnt too much of a waitim alway down to tri place i have not been to so i was assum this place would be similar to aloha kitchen or l and l

with that said it was just ok i order honey walnut shrimp spici chicken and loco moco to top it off we order a mango smoothi with boba

th honey walnut shrimp was a bit on the sweeter side the spici chicken was medium spici and a bit on the greasi side the loco moco was realli good but for some reason they gave me way too much rice 

now for the mango smoothi with extra boba waaaaaaaaay too sweet i could onli take a coupl sip and i was done 

they are situat in a pretti nice locat compliment with a super walmart across the park lot their set up is pretti spacious with a decent amount of tabl and booth 

servic was decent they get you your food as soon as it done

so overal i have noth over good or bad to report i would probabl go here onc in a while it just wouldnt be my first choicso it been a year sinc i step foot in here and this time it was more pleasant as far as servic  huge improv in fact  the guy work that even was realli cool and help  they had some special deal on their menu  699 for 5 bbq pork stick 2 scoop of rice which i pass up on and mac salad the bbq pork tast wise was good meat marin throughout just the cut of meat wasnt the best so the textur was more on the tough side but im still open to tri out other menu item next timethis will be a moder review or in starbuck terminolog a grand review the best way to summar the starbuck at the southeast corner of decatur and charleston boulevard is big on conveni and short on comfort

  the locat sit at the corner of two hyperbusi las vega highway in a super walmart shop center surround by fast food place if you are shop eat out or cruis along eastbound charleston and north and southbound decatur decatur entranc control by a traffic signal this is a conveni starbuck for a caffein boost

  this has to be one of the tiniest las vega starbuck that i have visit it just isnt veri conduc to relax there are onli four tabl five counter stool and a couch which can fill up quick in a hyperbusi area the standard handicap tabl is nonexist on anoth note a password combo is necessari to access the rest room forget about a drivethru it is attach to a panda express and jamba juice

  this starbuck need some work to be the third place that it is suppos to be i would not be surpris if starbuck rebuild this locat nearbi as a modern third place with a drivethru

thi starbuck is shown in an incorrect locat i check into a decatur boulevard locat that show this store oh well

th 2013 yelp 100 review 160this is the typic late night pizza to munch on when your not sober  theyr not exact open 24 hour but close enough  we got a half and half of hawaiian and margherita  that sound a heck of a lot better after a few drink but now sound ridicul as i type this  

the hawaiian side tout doubl canadian bacon doubl chees and doubl pineappl  everyth was doubl but the bacon  the margherita side was just a chees pizza with basil and slice tomato slap on the top  the chees was also burnt on that side due to the fact that the hawaiian side took longer to cook  i blame myself  

you should ask for a takeout menu befor you order becaus they have coupon you can use right on the spot like 2 xlarg which is actual just a larg pizza ani way you want them for a littl less then 18first of all i am a huge fan of hawaiian food and have enjoy l l mani year howev after expand my tast bud to hawaii california and some great hawaiian food here in the vega valley i have to say hmmmmm not bad l l

a locat  this one is near the walmart  sam club on seren just west of eastern  easi locat and parking

b  servic  is not great but not mediocr it is just okay they do not attempt to make a differ or to make it a great experience

c  food  great overal select  we order the katsu and the beef plate  the katsu was quit good and they give you a ton of food the mac salad was just right  where they get serious ding on the star is the beef  can you remov the fatti tendon that is all over the beef  you cannot eat this proper becaus so much sinewi fat is in this beef it is tough rough and downright a pain in the but to cut away with a plastic fork and plastic knife in a styrofoam plate  this is evid to the qualiti of beef they are use and i would say that all their salti flavor are cover up the poor meet tast  howev the textur total reek of poor quality

d  the bathroom  whi do lock it  what a pain where your hand are total greasi from tri to pick apart the fat from the meat then we cannot just push our way into the restroom we have to pick up a key on a long stick work the lock and get in  i just want to wash my hand and now i have to wash first to pick up the key yucky

overal the tast of the flavor is good the katsu good but the beef and the inconveni of this place overal caus me to give this a 3 star at best

gk say gas is still cheap keep drive to somewher elswas go to do an afternoon studi session at the starbuck next door and stop by this joint for lunch  if you close your eye and walk in the door you couldnt tell if your in a zaba chipotl or qdoba  what the hell are these chain doing

back to the experiencei order a steak burrito wpinto bean rice chees guacamol sour cream salsa and hot sauc on a whole wheat tortilla  of cours the guac was extra  i also order a side of chip  queso dipyeah i was hungry

they make it in front of you so there no wait  had a bottl of water to wash it down

th burrito is sosoit rank a distant 3rd behind qdoba  chipotl for me  the steak was a littl tough and didnt have much flavor  the hot saucebeansguac had all of the flavor  the whole wheat tortilla was tastydont know if it was healthi but im go to just tell myself to believ it was ok

th chip  queso dip were veri goodbut i was gain poundag with each bitestart to regret order ittast awesom but felt guilti consum extra calories

overal it was ok

wil i return  ehmaybok i was head home after check out anoth pizzeria and decid today was pizza day and stop by here to give it a try

i didnt expect to find a nice restaur but that exact what the place is like  it tuck between the summerlin renown kona grill  gordon biersch in the boca park shop center  this spot has fail numer time over the past 5 yearsi hope these peopl make it

anyway i sat at the bar and order a blue moon  they dont serv pizza by the slice hereso i had to go for a 12 person pizza  sinc i alreadi had 3 slice from the other joint i knew i had my work cut out for me despit the small size  i decid on a pepperoni  jalapeno pizzath bartend aubrey or was it audrieanyway she said the jalapeno kick your ass so was i sure i want itof cours i do

th restaur has a cool  comfort feel to it  ill have to bring the famili back sometim soon

aft a few minut my pizza came out  it was much larger than i expect  the thin crust was cook nice and cripsywel done just how i like it  howev there is a lot of sauc on this pizzamor than i normal like 2 in my book  

the flavor of the sauc overwhelm the pizza so it hard to tast the other ingredi  the pepperoni is the tini almost slim jim type and had good flavor to ittoo bad it was drown in sauc  aubreyaudri was right the jalapeno do pack a serious punchi was sweat pretti good after a coupl of slice and no it wasnt from the 100 degre dri vega heatit was from the jalapenosgood thing aubreyaudri kept my blue moon full

overal i enjoy the atmospher servic and the pizza

wil i return  yes i will bring the famili with me next time and tri a differ pieorder ny chines last week and now again this week this time with some friend who are alway order chines takeout i figur i want to see their opinions

w call ahead and ask for the broccoli and beef larg  

beef and broccoli was good nice amount of beef they didnt skimp it had a littl too much sauc for my like but everyon els love it im not a sauci person 

the lemon chicken had such a light and fresh batter on it it came on a huge bed of lettuc with fresh lemon the lemon sauc was on the side and it was a ton the chicken was veri tender not over cook at all i didnt like the lemon sauc it was veri sweet and thick so i skip it 

orang chicken was same as last time im still a sucker for the orang chicken at panda express but this is a nice second place i like that this time it had piec of broccoli got to get those veggi in just show that they arent consist though

oooh and we also order a side of the crab ragoon and they were so crispi and perfect i was impress with the amount of crabcreami cheesi stuff on the insid 

they told me it would be readi in less than 20 min and when we went in 15 min later it was readi to go and they were super busi too so glad i call ahead quick and fresh cant complain

it was realli cheap less than 30 buck for four peopl and we had left over for the next day the entre were 8 buck each and all came with steam rice winneroh fatburg i just dont know where we stand  you are tasti and fresh but just too freakin expens in my opinion

you pick the size of your burger i alway get the smallest which is pretti much on averag with other burger joint  you can choos to make it a combo with either or skinni fri and a medium soda which come to a littl over 11 not worth it for fast food in my opinion  

howev  their shake are fabul  they have a maui banana one at the moment which is delici  none of that artifici banana tast that i cant stand  i love itlook for a fun whimsic cake to honor our elvisthem wed high yelp review led us to contact las vega custom cakes

it took them almost a week to initi respond  they did not provid their propos on the day they promis  but we had enough leadtim not to get too stress about it

advis them we onli had 8 in our parti their smallest propos cake design was for 17 peoplebut hey  we like cake  who wouldnt want leftov or better yet seconds

a we were decid on the flavor for each tier there was somewhat of a debat over the top tier as we want a chocol fudg cake w ganach but they felt the cake would be too rich  the tier would be too short  they want to either have anoth fill cake the bottom tier was banana foster or to swap out the ganach for ice but after a few back  forth we final got our waykind of

turn out both cake were cover in a thick layer of italian buttercream which we felt was too sweet  especi after it was also combin w fondant  the cake  fill part howev were absolut fantast  stay moist for a few day afterwardsw just peel off the fondant  icing

so with a 335 cake for 17 peopl  an extra 50 for deliveri we had expect of be well look after  here is unfortun where our experi fell a bit short

know wed have lot of cake leftov we ask about storag possibl  were advis they would provid a small box for the top tier  guess they felt the bottom tier should just fend for itself

howev whether they forgot to includ it or the hotel misplac it there was no box  our leftov cake was brought out to us the follow day onli cover in cellophane

also at no time did anyon follow up to see if we receiv the cake how we like it or anyth  they deliv the cake to the pastri dept at the hotel  we never saw them  i realli felt for the kind of money we paid for the cake  for deliveri there should have been some follow through  follow up to make sure the custom was happi  at the veri least we should have been provid box for what was leftover

so while we were pleas overal w the present of the cake itself our experi is one that were not too sure well be repeat w this companichocol pecan bear and chocol caramel popcorn are the two thing i got to tri from here i didnt even know they had this place in vega and so it was a nice littl surpris to find out this place existed

th chocol caramel popcorn was sweet and crispi it was great
th chocol pecan bear were individu wrap and each one had some pecan and chewi caramel insid this was a nice sweet treat too

tasti treat from this place can onli make the vega experi even sweeterthis subway is around the corner from my hous and i just found it after live in the neighborhood for 3 12 yrs  it locat in a nondescript build kind of set back from the road next to the 711 which is probabl whi ive never notic it before

anyway i order my usual 12 bmt toast wgreen pepper mustard mayo onion saltpepp oregano oil vinegar lettuc tomato provolon  the sandwich artist did an ok job with the sammiesh went a littl light on the veggi so that was the onli downsid to it

overal an ok experi at subway  glad i found one so close to home

return factor  80right so this is the second time i have been here and i guess i had lower expect after the first visit
th woman at the bar was rude so i just ask for a menu and look it over at the tabl i was with 6 ppl from nsc we had just taken a crazi test so we want to grab a beer
i order a combo slider huge amount of food took over half home but it was realli fantast the wait staff was slow and rude but the food was good this time so it might be hit or miss here
til next timecame here with the better half tbh for lunch the other day  they have a special price of 399 right now  ive come to enjoy cici pizza when im look for cheap eats

thi locat is by far the lowest end one that ive visit  it a littl dirtier than the other two locat ive been  howev those two are the two newest

th pizza is still the same here as the other locat so at least the food is consist  we pile our plate high and left full

wil i return  it in my neighborhood so the chanc are highit 1030 pm your hungri lazi and in anthem what do you do was thank i found this place and they deliv becaus i didnt feel like get out of my pajama we order a larg 18 pie half meat lover half hawaiian receiv it 30 minut later hot not soggi at all was pretti impress with it be deliveri pizza coupl thing i was bum about  1 they forgot my ranch dress i ask for i cant eat my crust without it and the second time i order they forgot my bottl water and 2 they charg 5 for a deliveri fee and didnt tell me i was wonder how my bill came to 35 for pizza and 4 water 

mi hawaiian was still good cold the next day but the meat lover didnt reheat well it was so greasi that the crust becam mushi and soggi i would order from here again was decent for deliveriwas starvin like marvin yesterday morn and went to the drive thru to grab someth on the way to an earli morn meet  while i dont eat at mcdonald too often this one in particular was impressivewhi  well for starter they open both drive thru window which make it go 2x fastermani fast food place no longer open the second window and it take forev to get through

i order 2 sausag mcmuffin sandwich and a bottl of water  the servic was quick the food was hot and fresh  what more could i ask for

wil i return  next time im in a pinch for breakfast you betit si exact what you would expect for a strip mall chines place except for one thing the peopl there are realli nice and will to talk to you about the food or anyth realli for exampl i notic that there was a distinct smoki flavor to their fri rice so i was think mayb it was the pork they were use but after talk a while figur out that it was the oil they had that combin with the 700 degre wok impart a veri pleasant smoki aroma and tast to the fri rice

you can dine in simpl seat for about 16 peopl or take out or have deliv the dine room was clean and the restroom were spotless as well

th price were good my wife and i got away for under 1500 for the lunch special which includ eggdrop soup if you dine in but the dinner price were not much more to me ani time the wife and i can get away for under 2000 for a meal we feel lucki heck two peopl at mcdonald can easili pay more than 1500 for a meal

if you are in the neighborhood and want lunch give it a triit roberto they have locat all over in differ state and most peopl know roberto is the place to eat when it late at night and you are desper for food each locat is hot or miss as far as consist goe this locat is apart of a gas station but you walk up to the window from outsid the portion size here is great a lot of the menu item can easili be share the carn asada burrito is what i order with just meat and chees the tortilla this last time was good but the meat was grizzli i saw a huge block of chees just sit out on the counter instead of be in a refriger space that didnt look right i realiz after this last visit that with all the other food truck that offer great mexican food at afford price i realli have no need to come to roberto as muchas i wait in line to place my order for boba i overhear this seri of question to the cashier
so what is boba  is it a bean are there ani health benefit to this will it make me ani younger if i drink it
and as these question are be ask all my friend and i could do was look at each other and chuckl a littl bit  im surpris the ladi behind the counter was abl to keep such a straight face  realli  go read the sign outsid that give you a brief about what boba is  dont wast our time

with a name like no 1 boba tea it hard not to have high expect for the drink serv here  we had just finish a success session of shop at the outlet and the thirst was so veri real  i order a cantaloup slush with boba  i was realli hope for someth a littl sweeter  unfortun it seem the cantaloup flavor got water down probabl with too much ice and not enough flavor ad to the mixtur  they also do not skimp on the boba  they give load and load of boba  theyr boba is a littl more chewi than i usual enjoy my boba 

dang read that last paragraph i almost feel like im be a boba snob  actual this whole review is turn out that way  but i stand by my opinion  it an ok boba place but definit not number 1 at least in my bookthe park lot here is a dirt lot keep that in mind ladi when your pick out your shoe there is a beauti fountain as you walk into the courtyard minus the yard which is made up of two larg patio we chose to sit outsid even though it was still quit warm out becaus the atmospher and view outsid was much more appeal they have live music set up on the patio that is to your right as you walk in so if you want a bit more of a quiet atmospher sit on the patio along lincoln rd 

after we order they came out with a relish tray which consist of cold oliv radish broccoli cauliflow celeri stick carrot stick and some pepper the sticki bun were brought out at the same time and were pretti good but quick got a bit hard and were almost ined we both had a french onion soup which had piec of steak in it as our starter it was pretti good but after i notic a coupl of patron with the hous salad i wish i had order that instead for diner mike had the pepper crust sirloin with frite and i had the pork chop with a green chile risotto and green bean the serv were pretti big so we were definit not leav here hungri  howev noth realli stood out about our meal mike comment that he couldnt even tast the pepper on the steak and that the steak was pretti bland he immedi ask our waiter for some a1 my pork chop was pretti good it came with a salsa relish on top if it wasnt for the salsa my dish would have been pretti bland for the most part as well the risotto was ok last for dessert we both had the chocol cake with ice cream the cake was a littl rich for me so i had troubl finish it but it was pretti good 

the food was ok howev it not worth the regular price  for restaur week it was a decent deal the servic was great our water glass were constant be fill and plate taken away in a time manner 

skip dinner here and come and enjoy happi hour at their outsid bar and partak in the amaz viewmayb my expect were super high sinc el chorro lodg is like an arizona institut but after experienc a meal at this restaur i cant bring myself to give more than three star  dont get me wrong it was aok it just didnt blow me away

th histori of this place date back to the 1930s and is pretti amaz  you can read about it on their websit  the outdoor dine area is huge and has great view of camelback mountain  the live music provid for a nice ambianc as well at least live music when we were there on a saturday night  and our meal got off to a nice start with the relish tray and sticki bun  yum  but the servic was realli slow and the food was noth to write home about  we found it to be overpr as well

id consid return to el chorro for brunch or lunch or drink or just pick up sticki bun to go sometim but i wouldnt recommend it for dinneri have to say i was pretti disappoint with our brunch experi here 

ok class let have a lesson what make a good tradit egg benedict

definit not a place to go on a date the pita shack is strict utilitarian your here for the food  ive onli visit onc thus far and chose one hit and one miss  the hit was the gyro sandwich  love the moist and thicker greekstyl pita that came w the gyro meat the two pair well  too bad that the beef w hummus didnt fare as well the hummus was lack in the flavor depart and the dri beef chunk realli didnt help  i found myself favor the greekstyl pita to lend some of it tender textur to the dri meat and rend the whole dish more palat the crisper thin pita wasnt do this dish ani favor  do check out their homemad tahini sauc  i wouldv prefer it to be slight more viscous but the flavor was on point

th baklava look tantal and after be told their did not contain pistachio i bought a few piec  ala upon closer inspect these piec did contain pistachio chunk not just crush and sprinkl on top so the cashiermanag took the piec back  me so sad 110910

was go to whole food to buy a few stapl item when i was hit w a crave for falafel  rememb there was a pita shop next door so pop in after drop some cash at whole paycheck  i actual am a fan of wf and am will to part w some cash to get bread and organ uncur thickcut bacon my system can actual stomach  servic was friend as alway and i even score a whole piec sampl of their delici homemad walnutfil baklava  it top w pistachio so those w a mild pistachio allergi could just peel the top layer off and your good to go  believ you me the remaind is well worth the 2 or mayb less idk i didnt pay youll fork over for it  

the falafel patti were huge  howev just like the hummus theyr made w they werent veri flavor but i like the crunch of the patti even if they were on the dri side  the extra side of hummus and tahini didnt realli add ani flavor but they help to mitig the low moistur content of the falafel  i wouldnt buy anoth falafel pita here 2 star but the friend employe clean environ and the complimentari dessert deserv an extra stari agre with mani a review alreadi list here 

the venu is tini so dont bring a kid or a kid in a stroller 

come right when it open 

you will need lot of cash it is kind of pricey but you have to consid what you are do  support local farmer so you are not just nourish your bodi with that cash you are nourish your soulbeliefsvaluesmoralsetc 

dont expect a typic california style farmer market ton of select ton of boothsfarm 

volum and qualiti will vari great for produc item 

the bon bread chocol chip loaf is tdf mine didnt make it home everyon at the offic gobbl it up quicklik 

i can honest say ive onli come here a few time while it a nice farmer market and i love support local it doesnt fill my fridg with enough to suppli my full menu for the week i love to come and pick up some specialti item and then make a specialti meal or desert with those itemim not a fan of italian but a friend took me here and who am i to turn down a free dinner 

it was solid ok i felt like have some kinda bake cheesi comfortfoodi good but shock there is noth like that on the menu not even lasagna so i settl for the shrimp risotto which was pretti good we share fri risotto ball for an appet and they were pretti good too the bread basket was uninspir  just regular light toast sourdough slice with oil  vinegar my friend had the pound veal cutlet which he found a tad dri but they brought him some marinara on the side and then he like it ok 

the custom cocktail list is fun and the drink are realli good i had the ginger mojito which was fantast  serv with a sugarcan garnish  and my friend had some fruiti vodka thing both our drink were chockablock with fruiti minti greeni good  they do not skimp on garnish here

for dessert we share the profiterol which were also good 

the main problem as far as i can see is the atmospher it bore the place is locat on a walkway in the back of the casino veri claustrophob and dim with not much of a view  just hotel patron walk back to their room although i did see a bride in full wed attir carri a bag of hooterstogoso i guess the peoplewatch is ok 

overal if your stay at the trop then yeah tri this place otherwis it doesnt stand out i probabl wont be backlos favorito favorit  no es mi favoritos

th food is alrrriiggghht a littl overpr for bar food but it vega the fish and chip were pretti good but it had too much batter their shoe string fri were the best thing i ate

lunch or dinner buffet 399 through the end of februari to celebr their 25th anniversari  after that it 499star lost 

we go to whole food everi week at least onc sinc weve decid to tri to insist for the best qualiti food in our diet  

sunday we had a wonder plan to make a love risotto with canaroli not the usual arborio put love red onion sweet pea white wine larg shrimp piec organ veggi stock and top it with larg lemon zest crust pan sear scallop sound amaz right 

well we got the largest shrimp they had at the counter and they look fresh smell fresh it tast so fuck nasti like plastic inject shrimpjust this strong iodin and chemic plastic flavor unfortun we cook that into the risotto so a part of the flavor part way into the stock and into a bit of our food even though we pick out all the shrimp after the first bite back to cook 101 tast everyth even your base ingredi  ive come to reli on whole food be a place of qualiti so i didnt think to tast the shrimp i pre blanch befor turn into the rice 

gourmet beauti dinner spoilt 

overal i still like whole food but that was a big bummer that i could have gotten frozen shrimp for the supermarket and had a better dinner they should realli look into the distributor of those shrimp becaus they arent edibl our dog ate them just fine but one eat cat shit and the other tri to lick the other dog asshol after a poop the cat didnt want none of it so i gave the discern kitti gourmet some scallopif you are not stay at the quad odd are you will never find this place access is via a narrow escal and you may chanc on it if you are watch a show donwstair the place is awash in a red glow light with surfboard hang from the ceil and a spacious drink area out front the menu is typic  taco quesadilla burrito ensalada it was not busi on a friday night and most famili and older coupl were in the restaurant

but we stay becaus one thing caught our eye 1 margarita 2 if you get the strawberri one all night no limit even on weekends

no line and easi drink i am set the long drive to las vega began to fade away after the 1st coupl of sip ill make do with the accept foodi think they tri a littl too hard with the top and ruin an otherwis perfect burger i have onli been here one time and im sure ill return for anoth round btw  i realli dig the decor and sheriff joe should definit staylet me start by say that i was a veri good yelper regard the grind after my first visit i thought it deserv 2 star but wait it out to see if it was an acquir tast after head there to watch the bcs nation championship game monday night which by the way was possibl the most bore game id ever had the displeasur of watch the most interest thing about that game was oregon footwear i now feel confid that the grind fall squar on aok 

you know how sometim you get so use to associ one thing with anoth thing you start to mental associ them even if the second thing is miss like afflict shirt and be a huge douchebag you could be a veri nice person a gentleman and a scholar but if you talk to me with a shirt that has holograph angel wing on the back it will be absolut imposs for me to get the thought of you be a huge douchebag out of my head long enough to give you a fair chanc mayb that me be judgment but i prefer to think of it as excel time manag who has time to get to know everyone

thi is kind of how i felt about the burger at the grind the first time i visit their whole shtick is they grill them in a bajillion degre oven which give the patti a char finish i tend to associ this char tast with dri overcook burger and it was hard to get over that associ the first time i visit  howev on my last visit i came to the conclus that just becaus the outsid has that interest almostburnt flavor the insid is still actual quit juici and delici  not to mention the top for this particular burger i had the sweet and spici both time are spectacular so yes even though it took two visit i final did acquir a tast for the grind burger and now i can say im a fan

howev it bother the shit out of me when restaur serv 10 burger that dont come with a side of fri consid that potato are like the cheapest thing on the planet and french fri are possibl one of the most delici food group to ever exist this should be standard practic we did order a side of fri a la cart and they were good not as crispi as i would have like but fair but come on noth on the side of a 10 burger at least fez give you a salad i would have probabl given the grind 4 star if it wasnt for this but this review onli come with 3 the other one is a la cart on the second page of the menuthis is westgat so ampl secur is to be expect but when i approach the entranc on a happenin saturday night this was taken to new height the guy was nice enough when scrutin my id but then he said heylook up and to your right it was pretti confus until i spi a littl camera that took my mugshot befor i could ask what the point was

w have to photograph anyon whos under 25 he said not his fault and he wasnt be a douch but this is some 1984 shit that made me feel unwelcome

ok done rant this bar is ton of fun onc you make it insid huge tabl to chill out and get slosh with larg group drink are the usual westgat price but unlik a coupl of other bar they are made right i guess they didnt just hire their bartend for their boob job and bleach hair my chocol cake shot was the most delici 8 ive ever spent

th crowd is nice and who could forget the mechan bull it the main attract of this bar you can come watch all the slut from scottsdal show how they ride win

th most innov part of this bar is what happen after last call the blare music stop and the kitchen reopen revert back to a restaur until 330 im wari of all westgat food but i have to admit it a pretti badass idea

35 star round down for that mugshot ill becom a true fan if their food turn out tastiwhat doe rnr stand for rockin n rollin restin n relaxin accord to their websit it whatev you want it to be

wel in that case this time it go to stand for renewin n reviewin becaus that exact what im doin 

this past sunday even matt and i gave rnr anoth go and we experienc excel servic from our high attent server grant the place was empti so id still like to test it out again on a busier night but overal rnr deserv anoth star

id also like to take a moment to note that they have redesign their menu and the dish are quit awesom i went with the crispi rock shrimp taco and i high recommend this dish the shrimp are crunchi well season with a kick of spice and not greasi all 3 of my taco were overflow with shrimp  just take a look at the attach picture

their fri and tater tot are also pretti stellar i dont even realli like tater tot but rnr make their with sweet potato and crisp them to perfect the parmesan fri are also noteworthi not over power with season and not too greasi either  just perfect 

footbal lover take note  rnr has great special on sunday and they also have a huuuuuug screen that will pass all of your footbal watch requirements

rnr is your middl of the road hangout spot and after experienc an improv in servic i can definit say that ill be back for more rnr in the near futurid call this a place worth stop at if in the area but not good enough to go out of your way to get to it has some decent qualiti and a few letdown 

let me start with the posit i like the qualiti of their bagel they are chewi without be chewi if you know what i mean they has to be some pliabil in a good bagel but not so your feel like your chew on a piec of octopus

i realli dont care for how the chair hit you in the back at just a right height to make you feel as if your be held up it make eat discomfort this is bad

i do think the servic was friend though it got to the point where i felt i was check on enough that i didnt feel bad when i final just umph and nod instead of start a convers at everi interrupt as for bag thing up i didnt see ani plastic but lot of paper  so pretti good on the ecofriendli and the atmospher was warm enough though deliesque

i do find it odd they have a littl tv right by their beverag station tvs are eye magnet whi draw attent to the visual clutter of a beverag station veri odd and let see the slaw was mushi the whitefish a bit too fishi and the platter veggi were way too thick for easi eating

i didnt sampl a whole lot from their deli counter but it look well provis and the chocol cover macaroon incred so i did get a dozen bagel and when i got to twelv wait to see if they give out a baker dozen inde they do alway a nice touch

a an asid i did manag to get into some troubl while there you see there was this cute littl chick who kept eyebal me so id wink and shed smile and well this went on until my wife bust me flat cold midwink so when she turn to look at her she say oh so that who your look at ah the moment of truth and then she add  whi shes not even a year old and shes littl angel and then she vault into a chat with the mother and grandmoth and aunti 

man that was close

so my vote goe to stop in if your in the vicin but not put them on ani culinari bucket listafter see high prais for dupar from fellow yelper it was time to find out for myself  i was pleas to observ that the now 299 worldfam shrimp cocktail is still just as good as ever  devein shrimp were plump cold and tasti with a slight zesti cocktail sauc  they were relat small but not wateri in the least  

vaunt yellow splitpea soup with a lot of ham and bit of green pea was veri good and satisfi  but while the countri gravi was veri good and the whip mash potato well made the chicken fri steak was a littl tough so the main dish was onli fair and somewhat disappoint overal    

ice tea arriv warm was quit strong and quick melt all of the ice in the glass plus the extra ice request  a roll was blah and tasteless  cook carrot zucchini and broccoli were okay  a slice of fresh bake chocol meringu pie was excellent

servic was pretti good and seat comfort  but the carpet was old worn and litter  a mix result

xxx12 overalive had this place bookmark for sometim now after read all the rave review from other yelper  im in dtlv a lot and have no clue whi ive miss this place especi with all the great review  

locat insid the golden gate casino in fremont  dupar is tuck in the corner and is a rather small restaur  sinc golden gate is small itself dupar is easi to locat  

as soon as i open the menu i realiz someth  ive been here befor and to be honest i wasnt impress with my first visit  i rememb order what i thought was a ham steak and egg  for about 15 i thought that this is a fabul price  when my meal arriv i ask the waitress where the heck is my steak  turn out that i miss read the menu  for about 15 it was a ham steak and egg  my mistak and sinc i was crave steak my first turn out wasnt good at all  this had to be over 3 year ago and i have sinc learn my lesson 

this time i made sure i got steak and egg the right way  i got their ny steak wegg  these steak are grain fed but i realli didnt notic the differ  the steak was a littl dri and the egg were small in portion  i swear i probabl had one scrambl egg it that skimpi  my meal was just okay and sinc ive had better for about the same price i have to say i was disappoint  

there plenti on the menu but noth that realli jump out to me i thought the portion were small for the price  the servic was actual better than the food  attent drink kept full line but quick seat and easi check out  

would i come back  i probabl would onli if im in downtown alreadi  i may even bring up my rate after tri their pancak which is what they are known forperhap my problem is that no one at our tabl order the pancak those seem to  be the big thing that most peopl are 5starring

i gotta tell you though the omelet fill are a aw skimpi they say there is pepperjack chees in the denver omelet i didnt see a shred of chees in mine perhap i shouldv sent it out for forens analysi and if these were threeegg omelet they mustv been pigeon eggs

iv enjoy much much bigger omelet with way more generous ingredi for signific less than dupar 1250  all four of our hash brown order were burnt

ther noth wrong with dupar but there just not a whole lot right with it eitheri was realli look forward to this spot as hotel san carlo is such a dynam locat and lend itself so well to a loung environ but my experi was less than stellar less than mediocr actual but i can see this turn into a prime night spot if some chang are made like neutral that funki odor lower the bartend side of the bar area so they arent tower over you ban staff from use cell phone on the job discourag staff from sit on the bar this should be allevi onc the level of the bartend zone is complet educ the staff on the histori of hotel san carlo come on peopl you host a haunt hotel event everi octob it fun to learn the freaki side of the properti along with the hip end of it 

will i be back more than like but some serious attent need to be paid here prior to be serv i envis this as a primo locat for host a 30s gangster event with cigar smoke on the patio martini clapper and all the glamor of that era i can still see it just not as passion fix your issu or be prepar to vanish like a ghost after a proper smudg31611

came in to see what pomo had to offer on their happi hour menu certain cocktail drink are halfoff i had the lemon drop or someth akin to that with lemon vodka and fresh lemon juic  the two pizza ive tri here were just ok  the quattro formaggi mozzarella provolon gorgonzola and parmigiano was veri salti but good crispi crust that didnt stay crispi for veri long not even ten minut and the quattro stagioni minus shroom was tasti but i wouldnt order it again as the crust was veri soggi due to the tomato sauc  such a shame  

order the bruschetta  i had it for happi hour sad hh menu onli offer discount on cocktail not food  boo  so i order the bruschetta to tri while wait for the pizza i shouldv just order two of the bruschetta  love the crunch of the bread and the top tast so fresh  

the panna cotta i had for dessert was good you wouldnt have to twist my arm to order it again    but of cours id like to tri other dessert on the menu first  that is if they arent offlimit  mom like the millefogli w chantilli cream and strawberri offer to her as a token of appreci when we had dinner there on pomo firstyear anniversari  i realli enjoy the slice of anniversari cake i was given sinc i couldnt have the millefogli special due to powder sugar and cornstarch in this pastry

servic was veri relax and probabl model after the servic youd find in itali it brought us to recal the same nonchal attitud we encount when we visit rome mani year ago most if not all of pomo server and busser are italian from the old world complet w accent  mom and i note that most of the dinner custom here seem to be italian w mani of them carri an air of be visitor or tourist not local  

two visit and the onli thing i can vouch for are the lemon cocktail the bruschetta and the anniversari cake which wasnt even on the regular menu  one more tri perhapi wish yelp had a 12 star systemthi is anoth case where i would have given the joint 35 stars

iv read a lot of review about smash burger and want to give it a tri for myself  today was the day  i order the classic smash burger 13 lb and a chicago dog

th woman work at the counter was veri friend  i order it to eat in becaus i want to make sure i tast it fresh out of the kitchen  within 56 minut my order was ready

i decid to attack the smash burger firsti should have chosen the dogwhi  becaus the beef was pipe hot and it burn the hell out of my mouth  delici though but not awesom  i could bare tast the special smash sauc so the burger tast kind of blandit was fresh though and the egg bun was awesome

next i attack the chicago dogth top and bun were excel but the hot dog itself wasnt greatjust good  this is where that 12 star come in again

again overal id rate this place 35 stars

wil i return  yes but it didnt surpass my belov innout as so mani review have saidawww smashburg where do i start  i realli want to love you but i just dont  you are ok but just not so special in my book

i have been go on and off to smashburg for a coupl of year becaus my sister is in love with sb  the burger are ok and will get the job done but that is about it  they do have sever special burger with the sin citi burger be the highlight of the menu  they have recent ad a new truffl mushroom burger to the menu  i tri it the last time i was there and i was so disappoint by the burger  it was smother in truffl oil which complet overwhelm the whole burger as well as made it super oili  oh well i guess i will just stick with the sin citi burger from here on out

i dont know if this is true for you or not but the fri are super import to ani burger experi in my book  the fri here are soso at best  fri are super skinni and almost alway extrem greasi in a bad way   they just dont have much fri flavor for me but rather just fri oil  yuck

th side item that save smashburg for me are the haystack onion  these qualifi for the status of status know as oh my good fantast  i could eat 3 basket full of them i think  they are crunchi flavor and finger lickin good  yummy

overal smashburg is ok when you want someth nicer than the drivethru place but not my go to place by ani meanit break my heart to do this becaus at the rate i patron this place youd think id be up the star and i would if they would just fix a coupl of thing instead i find myself veri frustrat and i must remov a star from my review 

two reason 

here the crux of my beef i like the peanut butter flavor they offer chocol peanut butter everi monday but i dont want chocol peanut butter mind you they have chocol frosti everi day and this past monday they had sugarfre chocol in the same machin as chocol peanut butter and chocol frosti was still an option in anoth machin 

i havent seen the plain peanut butter in quit a while and i know im not the onli person whos been ask for it it especi good with ani of the berri flavor  like a pbj the fact that they load up the machin week with a flavor that custom could mix themselv and deni the rest of our request for the straight up peanut butter make absolut no sens to me 

so fine it your yogurt shop you pick the flavor at least let me know if it worth the drive im will to tell you exact what will make it worth it for me know there at least one flavor i want and it doesnt even alway have to be peanut butter 

i have ask and suggest and have overheard other do the same that the day flavor be post on a websit facebook or twitter the respons was that it was not practic becaus they couldnt be updat all day long and they didnt want a custom to be mad if they came for a particular flavor that was post but had run out i dont agre ahem it the digit age peopl your not send the poni express out with an updat but i can understand the concern 

instead i was encourag to provid my cell phone number to be associ with a particular flavor and i would be sent a text messag the next time that flavor was avail i dont know the mechan of blast a text but it seem that would be a lot more time consum or at least equal than updat a fan page on facebook or post a tweet 

also by the way onc theyv text me my number would be cross off the sheet and id need to rerequest to be notifi talk about ineffici 

yogurtolog has great flavor avail to them the bar and shop are clean they could total be five star i want to be abl to give them five star but i cant in fact as a regular custom im so disappoint i cant even stand by my yay im a fan right now in my book theyr aok if im go to go for frozen yogurt this is where id go and id pray id be delight to find a flavor i love in one of the machin but i wouldnt know until i got there 

chang that and ill restor the starthe concept and market approach are awesom guy that run it are great and im happi theyr kill it in lv  im sure theyll do so for a long time  but this is pretti much a one and done for me unless i know theyr break out some of the crazi look special they got on their site like the montecristo  

be 10th in line when they open and have to wait 40 min is understand but im not plan to do it again anytim soon  my wife and i tri 5 of the burger w the pep pep be by far and away the best one and the barbi come in 2nd  captain was dri and fri were fri  for 9 i would rather just go to lbs for happi hourthe last time i saw 3 guy in a bus hand thing to a huge crowd i woke up a week later on the phish tour bus with a girl name love moonbeamor moon lovebeamor beam moonlov mayb it was nanci  whatev  it was told i had a good time i was told i was a god  i was told to get off the bus immedi damn hippi are so sensit  make one grace slick heroin joke and sudden you are pol pot never trust a hippi alway wash ani midget you come in contact with two thing that will serv you well dear readers

wel what doe this brief moment with the unwash have to do with anyth i dont know i just swallow two green pill i found in an alley way i woke up in last night anoth long stori but it begin as all long stori dowith a fist full of cash and a woman of illreput  so befor i nod off or run 15 mile backward againi will continu with my word of love food and tini microb that live in our brains

so everywher rex has hung his hat his love purpl feather hat one constant thing i hear is how the hell did you find us  after that is how good the slider truck is  slider truck scream as they run faint murmur of slider truck silenc time and time again the same pattern  i know whi they scream i didnt understand the slider truck obsess  well rex is no stranger to herp and take food from stranger in a vehicl  usual with those two thing i see a caus and effect  thank this time i didnt have to do anyth untoward just pay money and the food came

so me and my favorit part time wench went to a park in henderson to tri this local phenomenon  i got into line the line bare move i wait the line bare move i wait 30 minut and i was not much closer rex becam angri rex becam incens rex cri out to the sky rex cri  after an hour two beat and a slight case of heat stroke i arriv at the window i had gone to their websit and studi their menu i knew what i want i order like a pro the kid who took my order smile bright and call me his hero i blush me and my sometim intim partner i onli have to pay scale move over to wait some more  we order 1 barbi 2 pep pep and 3 pull porki we ad drink and the sweet potato fri  we wait some more it took time rex hate wait and this has tri my patienc and my left hook to the point of exhaust  final the food came we celebr we danc she cri out of her nonglass eye  it was a beauti day onli about 200 degre outsid we sat under a tree the food smell great  

i ate the barbi and the bbq sauc was great and the caramel jalapeno balanc the sweet  the pep pep was like an attempt at a gourmet big mac the sauc was veri familiar and veri tasti tangi and sweet it was good then the pull pork tender pork bbq sauc and a littl heat from the jalapeno i ate one of the sweet potato fri and then put about 75 of the contain in my mouth at one time  the verdictdecid mix  i admir these kid and their attempt to recreat the food truck of other citiesbut it need to be more than just clever and right now this is just clever the star of the show was the pull pork and whyit was the  onli thing that wasnt overcook it wasnt sauc enough and it need a littl more flavor in the pork when it was cook but overal it was veri good the bun has a bit of greas on it and that made it veri butteri that was nice  the burger had the potenti to be amaz but they just werent they were so far overcook that the barbi i had was like a hockey puck the pep pep was veri good but again over cook and under sauc i love the fri they were well done and relat invent salt sugar and spice excel anoth surpris flavor could have realli step it up a notch but i am not go to nitpick 
i want to like these guy i want to support them but when i spend almost 30 buck on dinner i better get more than some realli over cook meat  the portion were slider size but the price were gourmet 3 for 7 buck and the execut was decid not gourmet 

i think the wors thing i can say is that given the wait the overcook meat and the lack of some basic fundament with the food i cant say i would come back if i didnt have to wait an hour i would eat there again but right now the town is obsess with novelti food that lack sophisticationwhi should i spoil that for them  to me this is like date a supermodel without a vaginaslight depress terribl irrit and not worth the time you put into it you want to love her but you cant

you can love rex tri as hard as you can rex cant love younever tri the food truck but with the open of this locat my friend and i figur wed give it the chanc to impress be that these are slider ie not veri larg or fill we tri a coupl each now i probabl wouldv gone with more than that but the price here are bugnutti bonker 300 averag for one slider it is more cost effect to eat at an actual restaur like red robin which simpli isnt reason for a drive thru now let me describ these thing to you

th bun is a fit size for a decent slider but this becom a problem when the ingredi insid dont even reach the edg what compris ani one of these thing are tasti qualiti ingredi but good luck experienc them under all that bread you can expect a golf ball size gob of meat that isnt flatten much with top sprinkl or stack in a way that make it more tall than wide often time especi in the use of someth like feta chees it all fall out the second it move or bump yes they are nice but 2030 more between the bread wouldv made a world of differ and might actual let you tast something

so about a dollar a bite for someth overpow by the most plain ingredi to back these up we had the plain fri as have them top with sauc chees bacon or even marshmallow result in a near doubl of the price absolut noth special tast about as bland as fri can possibl tast to be nice they had a pleasant crispi to them and are quit heavi so even more carb overload to quiet the protein defici the slider may have left you with

th insid aesthet is comic book heavi with minim seat and an absolut ridicul number of employe mill around each other like a small mob i count 13 in a space design for about 7 and this place push stereotyp hipster as hard as it possibl can on everyon that goe near the place i fulli expect there to be box of buddi holli glass just sit around in the back room becaus half the employe wear them as part of the uniform expect to be treat like some longstand homi with iron underton that were all too cool to be in a fast food joint it as if manag is push so hard for the place to be consid hip that it fli magnific overboard into some kind of surreal joke sup bro sweet bump thatll be twentyeight bucki have alway been enamor by the food truck cultur but with my busi schedul i find it challeng to search them out with that said i was pretti stoke when i learn that our communiti center on base is organ food truck friday we had such a good turnout that 1 of the 3 truck ran out of food earli on fortun we still were abl to get some grub from slidin thru which was what i realli came out there for

what i love about their busi is their websit i think websit for food truck are their most essenti tool as it has to be frequent updat and easi enough to navig so from their onlin menu i alreadi know what i want to tri plain jane pull porki and the barbi i place my order and was told about a 1520 minut wait i was a bit disappoint that their price is a littl bit differ i thought you would get 3 slider for 7 base on previous yelp review but it actual 3 for each slider now 

i got the food and was instant underwhelm zero present was put into the slider which look well sloppi i can understand if they were busi but there were onli 2 peopl ahead of me wait when i order the slider were good mayb a littl bit too much bbq sauc for my person tast but the pull porki easili came out on top 

mayb im be a littl bit critic here but i was realli hope for a much better experi it my first visit so i would still like to tri their other slider in the futur there just a lot more food truck to be experienc in vega so for now im move on1st experi at the new vig was great i sat outsid and had a veri friend server she was prompt and person the food was ok noth spectacular but worthi of a second tri the new vig is pretti cool veri similar set up to the arcadia one nice open patio and bocci ball court 

2nd experi at the vig was aw the servic was horrend but let me back up i arriv just befor 6 and attempt to pull in to the park lot i saw the valet guy make wild hand gestur to car but wasnt realli sure how to interpret them car were honk tri to get past me on 16th street i pull in and they tell me the valet is full and i have to park across the street anoth valet has park a car in front of me and there were alreadi 2 car that pull up behind me where was i go to go i final was abl to get out and park across the street and when i walk over i saw about 3 other car go trough the same ordeal here is a tip  put a sign out say lot full it not brain surgeri it valet parking

i got in and join our tabl of about 20 we had one server for our tabl he was fluster and had a realli bad attitud he seem to be onli serv half of our tabl it took him 25 minut to make his way over to us and take our order well partial he took my order an then ignor everyon sit next to me he actual ignor nathan for about half an hour at one point he turn to some one and said youll have to wait becaus everyon is yell at me at onc sorri buddi mayb you should have more than one person serv us if you cant handl it yes my food is get cold and no you still havent brought me that fork i ask for 10 minut ago better yet whi dont you take it out on the custom here what an ass  

in addit to the servic they ran a charg for 34800 on my card it didnt actual post as a charg becaus they caught it but it took away from my avail credit in my check account for about 6 day 

i will go back becaus the food is decent and the décor and ambianc are great ill just make sure to park across the street and get a differ serverwhen i think of rambo of cours the first thing that come to mind is sli himself go berserk and killin fool that a big negat here instead you come in to find all old school 50s to 70s paraphernalia they even have old school game spread out on some of the tables

a for the food i would say it was averag if anyth i say it a bit pricey just for your basic burger salad etc after go over the menu and decid i didnt realli wanna spend more than 10 buck for lunch i went with the pick two option of a half sandwich and either a salad or soup i went with the shave turkey on sourdough with a garden salad becaus their soup of the day choic were barley and tomato price for that was around 7 buck after i finish my food i was actual still hungri so i had no choic but to order home made fri on the side which were actual not bad but now im go over 10 buck sinc the fri were 3 buck smh

the total plus tip was around 13 dollar again if i was gonna spend 10 buck for lunch it should be worth spend but in my opinion here was not worth it the onli shine light was misti who was my server she was spot on from take my order to bring it out to refil to get my check to cash me out she did her job with a smile it is not her fault the food and price were the way they were

so for the record i love check out new place there are some that warrant follow up visit unfortun this isnt one of themi had an extend bike ride this sunday morn so i decid to add breakfast into my morn ride  ive been in the plaza sever time when i was pick up thai food nearbi but i never never stop here  sunday they open a 8 and i was there at 810  a littl warmer and i could have eaten outsid but it is december

misti was my server and she was a gem  veri pleasant smile lot of help inform lot of coffe refil  

i order the red rock bene which the menu describ as layer of focaccia bread bacon fresh spinach poach egg and homemad hollandais  it not layer of focaccia  rather there are two veri larg cut of focaccia each about two and a half to three inch tall  im guess those are the cliff at red rock  the rest was the standard benedict except for the bacon  the breakfast come with choic of home fri or breakfast potato and if you get breakfast potato you can get them plain or with fri onion and pepper  there a small charg for the onion and pepper someth i didnt see on the menu

th bene was ok  there simpli too much bread i ate one slab and halfway through that i move the other poach egg and spinach onto the half eaten cliff  the breakfast potato were season well and the onion and pepper were veri good  worth the up charg  other than too much bread my one complaint would be that the egg were poach too long  they were not runni when pierc but were semi hard yolk  

note  saturday and sunday are the onli day they sell the two kind of benedicts

i realli like the insid  the 60s tie dy thing peac symbol and the music be play that i grew up with made for hum along with the sound track  it was ok  there was onli one coupl besid me in the place and they were at the other end so no one need to go run out

th sign of lucill ball and vitametavegamin seal the deal for me  a place that would have this sign is aok in my book  check out elvi  hes in the bathroomive heard a lot about rais cane so i decid to tri it out for myself today for lunch  i order the chicken sandwich combo wfri  a bottl of water and i order two chicken strip on the side

sinc i order it to dine in they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my tabl  while i was wait for my meal i look around and saw mani custom enjoy their food  i must be get old becaus i felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant

aft a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out  i tri a few of the fri firstthey are the crinkl varietythey were good but not great  next i bit into the chicken sandwichcaut the chicken is extrem hot  i burn the hell out of my mouth with that first biteth chicken must have come right out of the fryer  wow  i couldnt tast anyth becaus my tast bud were wipe off the face of the earth

i munch on a few more fri while i wait for the chicken to cool down a bit  after a few minut i finish the rest of the sandwich and thought it was goodbut again not great  the sauc in the sandwich was the highlight  the chicken was just okwa kind of bland to me  i then tri the 2 chicken strip i order on the sideagain i thought they were kind of bland  the qualiti of the chicken was veri good thoughnic tender white meat chickenjust not enough flavor for my tastes

wil i return  probabl notit just didnt wow melive on the east side of las vega we are limit on good place to eat thai cuisin is a place ive been go to for year thai food is probabl one of my favorit type of food to eat so ive tri mani place in the valley this place rate right in the middl 

the food is good enough to crave but not great enough to be my number one choic of cours if i dont want to drive far and i have a crave i dont realli have much of a choic 

the thai beef salad here is delici just the perfect amount of lettuc and spice i alway cri about how thai place do not like to put a lot of veggi in their thai beef salad they think a lot of beef is what peopl want but not everyon i love my veggi 

last visit we had order spici seafood soup one of my favorit dish to order it come out in a bowl on fire soup is sour with a great kick to it larg varieti of seafood insid we also order chicken pad thai first time order it here it was ok noodl were cook well but there was a lack of flavor it was more on the sweeter side

servic is great they bring out complimentari egg roll which is appreci they dont accept debitcredit card for some reason but they do have a atm insid the restaur so be prepar to have cash if you decid to dine heregambler breakfast

how do i like my burger with egg of course

i will give you this warn though if you get lure in by the cheap food ad they have outsid their casino just know that those are club member prize no fret though they let you sign up at the cafe i didnt have to give my real name last time lolalright so we were downtown fremont enjoy a fun date night out and happen to smell the burger a sizzl over at binion cafe we were hungri and  rememb the yummi burger we had last time our servic and experi from the previous visit was horrend and we decid to give the cafe anoth shot we decid to stroll through and check out the wait and to our surpris there was no line and plenti of open seats

w grab a seat at the bar and were greet by the main cook who is awesom he took realli good care of us all of the way through kept our drink fill and even chat with us for a bit

th burger were delici and our tab was low so you cant beat that with a stick

i am pleas to announc our visit was much better this time around so we will be back for burgerthe way im drawn to corndog is magnet is this a good thing a bad thing perhap just a thing i dont know but sinc i think a corn dog is just a hot dog wrap in a delici sweater it make me happy

big hurt happen to sell corndog veri late into the even which is good for late night munchi they also sell fri that are too salti unless you realli like a lot of salt in which case they might just be good and wait for it cheeseburg on donut instead of bun so in case all the gambl and drink doesnt kill you theyv got you coveri never thought i was abl to eat 35 wing in one sit but appar i am  mayb ill add that to my resum in the futur  

i am on board with everyon els opinion  it a 3 star place  no more no less  14 or whatev it is for all you can eat wing is reason  1 draft are nice as well 

it great they dont charg a ridicul price for celeri like buffalo wild wing or hooter who charg somewher around 3 for ranch and celeri  81 cent here  i am bore and dont care about the teriyaki bbq or parmesan garlic wing  i just want em hotnot everi meal in vega is go to be over the top sometim you just need a quick bite to eat after lay by the pool all day 

bonanno is locat at the food court in the district it is conveni to the mgm pool complex also they are open latemayb 24 hour they do serv breakfast

just had a quick slice of pizza but it was delici cheap and quick exact what i was look for great option for a late night snack too sinc most place in the area stop serv food around midnighti came here with friend due to the glow yelp review servic was excel of the dish i sampl their karekar was the shine star with real peanutti flavor and love oxtail and veggi this sinigang stew with shrimp  a sour soup made with a tamarind base was pretti good and arriv with ampl shrimp i person wish it was twice as sour but it satisfied

less impress were sever dishes

th lumpiang shanghai a deepfri meatfil spring roll with a sweet and sour dip sauc lack flavor and texture

th pancit palabok crave season and ani anato seed flavor the rice noodl were unexpect thin like a vermicelli but the lack of flavor was the main issue

th halohalo mixmix special as dessert was just pure disappoint  in their menu the regular halohalo descript includ sever compon while the special seem to includ the regular ingredi plus ube purpl sweet root crop ice cream the special arriv in an okaylook present of crush ice with condens or evapor milk red nata de coco coconut gel someth els that was red and seem coconutbas as well as ube ice cream it was miss red bean garbanzo macapuno shred sweeten coconut and pinipig crunchi crush young rice ani addit of even just one of those ingredi would make it truer to it nameawww checker im so glad i found you again after so mani year  i grew up with you but then move to vega and thought we would never see each other again  oh happi day becaus you have now open a place in town so our romanc can continue

so it has been about 20 year sinc i had checkersr  i rememb them be the best burger and fri in the world  i was so excit to grab some food here and reliv my childhood with my famili  the baconzilla burger was tasti the fri  chicken sandwich was like everi other fri chicken sandwich at fast food place and the fish sandwich was in the same boat as the chicken  the fri are still pretti tasti be cover in all sort of season and fri to be on the crispi side  the food wasnt as fantast as i rememb it but it was still pretti tasti  the milk shake are quit yummi here too  they even have banana milk shake which you dont see often  

the onli negat here are the serv size on the fri  the small order of fri look like it should belong in the kid meal not the adult meal  so if you are hungri go for a bigger size otherwis you will still be hungri afterward   the drink and the sandwich all seem on par with other compar places

th price all seem a tad on the high side for what you get  they arent outrag but more than what you will spend at mcds or bk or the like on a similar meal deal

thi particular locat is on a realli busi corner so you have to be care get in and out of the place sinc everyon drive like maniac in this area  it can also take a bit to get out of the park lot onto the main street again due to the high volum of traffic  this is not a good place if you are crunch for time  

as for the seat it is outdoor onli so keep that in mind if you plan on go in the middl of juli  also with it be on a busi street corner it is loud sit outsid due to the traffic sounds

so yes checker is a yummi fast food joint for good burger  the fri are tasti but order a bigger size than normal for yourself  and last give yourself some extra time sinc everyth is on the slow sidethe second i walk into dw bistro i was greet by their over friend staff a waiter and one of the owner i believ that warm and invit atmospher continu throughout dinner but despit how friend everyon was there were a few miss that made this a lessthanstellar experience

mi son and i came here for an earli dinner and order chicken finger and the brais short rib respect they do have a kid menu with typic kidfriend item such as mac n chees slider and chicken finger i do have to give dw credit for put their own spin on the kiddi item the chicken finger 5 were real strip of white meat light bread and serv over a bed of rice with some veggi mix in my son 2 yrs old like the chicken but didnt touch the rice but that has more to do with him be extrem picki than the qualiti of the rice

a for my meal what came out was an order of their brais ox tail 16 not the short rib i was realli hungri and didnt want to wait for them to bring out the correct meal so i ate what they brought out and let the waiter know he screw up he was apologet but didnt do anyth more than that take the dish off the check would have been nice or a free dessert something

th ox tail wasnt bad it was serv over a bed of mash potato with asparagus and cucumb the meat was falloffthebon tender but could have use more season and there wasnt a lot of it i also order a side of plantain 7 that were fri nice make the outsid of each piec crunchi while the insid was soft again a littl more season would have made it a better dish

th atmospher theyr go for is trendi and chic but becaus of their locat  in a strip mall in suburbia  theyr almost forc to compromis a bit and be kidfriend im not complain of cours becaus i was with my son and i realli appreci the fact that they offer my kid a color book and crayon while we wait for his food but it doe make for a slight odd environ  one that isnt upscal or popular enough to cater to onli adult a la rosemari and cheesey enough to be a famili destin claim jumper cheesecak factori etc

th bottom line is dw bistro is a good off the strip restaur with an intrigu menu decent food at good price and veri friend custom servic but it best for adult not kid even though theyll make everi custom feel welcomso we final made it out for sunday brunch for this high yelp establish after about a 30 minut wait we were seated

whoa the nois level insid is crazi the reason alcoholthi place make for hilari peopl watch too to our left we have the ladi from wait to exhal laugh and scream at the top of their lungsthey alreadi have doggi bag but stay to get their drink on

to our back we have the cast of the real world with the open flamboy one tell everyon in the dine room his busi also with doggi bag also gettin their mimosa on

enough about the drama around us we came here for the foodyelp review talk high about the pastri basket so we went with that we saw the french toast and pancak come out of the kitchen but luckili i saw a tip from jewelyn tmahalo sistah say the pancak and french toast wasnt all thatand my hawaiian sweet bread french toast kick ani french toast ass anyway buahahaha so we ask our waiter about the most popular itemsth chilaquil and chicken and waffl are to die forhmmmupsel much wifey saw a steak and egg benedict on the tabl next to us and our waiter said those are so popular we just 86d them so she got the chilaquil and i want a sandwich with sweet potato fri the blt is what he suggest so i went with that

15 minut later our pastri basket come out nice and warm guava goat chees tartbangin cinnamon muffinyum banana toffe sconewow so far so good

but

chilaquil arriv look better than it tast you cant identifi the tortilla becaus it is a mushi mess under the fri egg and it was overkil on the spice

blt come out bacon is more like jerki heirloom tomato are a nice surpris but the toast brioch is dri and sandi not soft and toastygood ingredi poor execut sweet potato fri are stone cold so i send them back 68 minut later
instead of fresh bright orang fri theyr a mix of crisp burnt one and soggi new one even mickey ds and innout dont refri their fri total disappoint we just ask our waiter for our check scream come from the wait to exhal tabl becaus one of them knock over her mimosathen crash the real world tabl drop two bottl of hot sauc all over the floor and the flamboy one doe a two snap up with a circl follow by an ohhh shitit was a veri long 20 minut befor we final receiv our bill after our waiter top of both tabl mimosa yet again without pay attent to ani sign of public drunken and the fact that these peopl will get behind the wheel

h also deliv a steak and egg benedict to the tabl next to us86d my ass i still would like to see what lunch and dinner are all about so right now im give dw bistro the benefit of the doubtright now it aok at 3 starsth ball is in your court for that 4th or 5th staraloha


yelp 365 challenge341365 diss  dwmy guess would be this place is a hit for breakfast or lunch at least that is what the major of the review are rave about we stop in for dinner the restaur has a veri cool and modern vibe to it our server came over immedi and brought out water for us the water was lukewarm and had no ice which i found a tad strang the dinner price on the menu were on the high side and henc whi the lower rate their from the grill section averag at about 25 per plate i just ate a fine dine restaur on the strip and my entre that absolut blew me away was 32 so the price at this restaur threw me off a bit simpl salad averag at about 15 here you get the point it was pricey for an off strip restaur in the middl of a strip mall

i opt for the jamaican curri chicken bowl with couscous 14 the portion was huge the veggi fresh and the curri was adequ there realli wasnt much kick to it i ad quit a bit of cayenn pepper to my left over which made it more delici and less bland now they could have easili made the portion half of what it was and had lower price point this is especi applic to the higher price item on the menu this would affect the margin willing to pay of the consum but i digress 
boyfriend had jerk chicken scampi over linguin 16 and that was veri deliciousbut onc again the portion was quit large

our server was great friend and accommod throughout they brought us a complimentari slice of their carrot cake and it was amaz the gestur was also well appreci  i would probabl tri them for lunch or breakfast again but this would not be my choic for dinner

mi suggest would be to reconsid the portion size and price accord but someth tell me that most of their revenu is generat dure brunchlunch and dinner is an afterthought therefor this busi model work for themcoffe that repeat itself

i can do that all by myself

i just need to forget to take my prilosec and my morn cuppa joe will repeat most of the day is there much of anyth more unpleas than be on the receiv end of somebodi els coffe and onion bagel burp complet with acid reflux grace notes

so i make sure that i take all my medic when you get to be my age you are pretti much at the merci of the medic professioni person seem to be held togeth entir by surgic grade super glue titanium rod teflon insert and a pharmacopeia of truli stagger proportion

anyway the match that light this particular rocket everi morn is coffee

sometim i take my coffe at echo i have said it befor and i will say it againi realli do not understand how some of these place get their nameswhat doe sound reverber have to do with coffe and the accompani treat bread and what notwhat

and a pretti decent cup of coffe it iseach cuppa is individu drip brew and serv in a nice big ceram mugperfect for warm up on these chilli 80 degre autumn mornings

accord to steve at echo they do not have muffin croissant bagel no not even onion bagel ever nor breakfast sandwich to carb you up to face the day

accord to the messag from stevethey do have blueberri scones

a anyon who has read my littl stori will attest accuraci in my recit of menu item is of critic import to me

ok

mi visit have been for coffe and i glanc at the bakeri case i was sure that i saw some of the abov but appar not but i dont realli eat the pastri anyway

i can onli comment on the coffe and the place

echo is open and airi nice decor and has lot of big communal workineatindrinkin tabl to set up shop and while away the hour you know look for workwrit your novelsurf huluupd your fb status like that your job until you have to go home and face realiti no internet no cabl no power nowel just no

echo is conveni to me and easili found by pretti much everybodyecho also has plenti of park in the lot for their build unlik so mani of their coffe hous brethren so i take the occasion meet at echo

echo is a pretti solid 3666666666666666666666666666666666666 star oopsmi 6 key echo a few time and as alwaysno round up

thank for the correct steve110310

25 stars

first time  echo coffe  funni i expect a lot more polish and flare trippi ambienc highlycharg even  after look at the glossi onlin photo but the space look tire and neglect i certain didnt feel like i had to occupi this space ani longer than to grab a cup of coffe and some pastri  even the merchandis section cup bag of coffe and poorlystock echologo shirt was in disarray  who would feel like theyd like to buy a souvenir from here  unfortun even the photo i took of the pastri mirror the sad state i found their former home in 

if you like cranberryoatm cooki then you must tri echo version chewi and moist chock of dri cranberri oatmeal and nut almond i think  all the ingredi balanc each other out so that the cooki wasnt cloy sweet  the slice of banana bread which came highlyrecommend by the servercashi was a differ stori heftyport it also look moist and full of delight bananagood but felt veri dri harden almost and didnt have much flavor  i felt dupe into pay for a dayold or mayb even two daysold slice  dip the cake into the coffe didnt help matter  all the dip did was deposit greas into my black coffe  i just chuck it in the trash  shame on you echo

ah but i might still come back bec the drip coffe and cooki fill my need for speed  caffein and sugar that is  i realli appreci the fact that everyth serv here was made w organ ingredi  i will say that the custom servic was friend and help alway a plusid like to start out by say that echo has some truli exquisit coffe anytim i feel like blow a small paycheck on coffe i come by to treat myself if you are come in for a singl serv drip latt americano etc their price are pretti compar but god forbid you are look to buy whole bean then you will be pay upward of 20lb the owner claim this is cheaper than ani place in town but i have yet to find a place that has charg me more for bean 

anyway will i continu to get my coffe here occasion probabl it is good is it that good to make me a regular my respons is it coffe not rid the world of global hunger

a for the coffe snobberi report in previous review i wrote a nice email say how much i love love love their coffe and simpli ask if they would consid reduc the price of bean a littl so i could buy them more often and here is the email i receiv back you be the judge

regard our price in the marketplac for the qualiti of coffe we offer we are one of the lower price in town counter this my wholesal cost increas by 80 on green coffe last year and accord my  margin erod substanti  i was abl to contain most of that cost increas with a slight 5 increas in my whole bean coffe price 

in comparison i know of no other product i routin buy where the busi owner was abl to absorb such a huge price increas and not pass on more to the consum imagin that happen to milk or gas 

so here the thing specialti coffe like i use and sell at echo is expens  onli 5 of all coffe produc in the world is good enough to be consid specialti coffe and that all i use  that other 95 cost substanti less sure i could switch to this inferior product so that i could charg you less but it wouldnt tast as good 

anyway i regret i cant charg you less truth be told what you are ask me to do is veri close to just give it away as much as id like you to drink my coffe echo is tri to be a for profit compani a goal we have yet to achieve

thank steve a simpl i wish you could but im sorri great coffe is realli expens wouldv done the job i appreci you make me feel like crapi tri johnni small last night with a meetup group while they were get our tabl readi a few of us sat at the bar and had a drink i decid to ask the bartend for one of his person specialti he end up give me someth he call the naughti irishman i didnt realli watch him make it but it look like it was primarili jameson and bailey with crush ice i give him prop for hand crush the ice the drink was pretti good but it came with the typic vega price tag of about 13

onc seat we did the ayc tapa thing for 1999 per person note that you technic need a hard rock player card to get that price otherwis it 2399 base on the price of each item i got my money worth on the other hand if i disregard how much they list each item i still probabl got my money worth id say their tapa are a mix bag most of them were decent to veri good noth was amaz if i do this again i have a few item i would skip

th good
 poona tuna  i start off with this becaus someon mention it on yelp the cherri limead was an interest sauc and the tuna was mayb slight overcook but i enjoy the dish
 jack  coke  one of the better item veri tasty
 lettuc cup  shrimp was slight overcook but that just be picki this was quit tasty
 sea bass  i onli tri some of this from someon els order it was pretti good but not my favorite
 tuna sashimi  it hard to mess up ahi tuna this was simpl and tasty
 surf  turf  the vanilla butter ad a strang flavor to the mix but pretti good overall
 grill pbj  i found it a littl strang that the jelli was on the side ie you had to add it yourself but it was still good honest i prefer the fri pbj we had at the elit event at republ but come on it grill pbj

the bad
 chicken  waffl  disappoint the chicken was not tasti at all i didnt like the bread and onc again it was overcook the waffl fri were pretti good though
 octapussi  i dont like the tapioca batter that they use skip

th ugly
 tater tot  it might be the truffl oil but these smell and tast like gasolin they were nauseous

you can view their entir tapa menu on their web site httpbitlyjsmalls

im go with a round down aok on johnni small id return if someon suggest it the decor is trendi and there are definit some tasti item here 20 is a good pricesad whb has slip off it pedest for me  late there have been some disappoint  actual mani disappoint  as usual price have gone up while qualiti has gone down

even though item are put out in small batch mani time they are not fresh  i use to regular enjoy their petit steak but now theyr just dri tough and overcook  the pasta dish may or may not be worth consid  the crab leg on occas are just bad  at time i have wonder if they were left over from sunday brunch  and when i ask for a fresh made tortilla per the sign that say made to order i was direct to the one sit in a basket that were alreadi stale on the edg  realli  the guy man the station was do noth  

while there are day whb is near a 5star visit those day are becom further and further between  we use to eat here almost week but have drop to mayb month becaus of the inconsist in qualiti  it becom a we have to eat now situat and usual not worth the 4560 price tag for dinner for two review is for the sunday dinner buffet which was a good deal 

it random that we end up here of all place but sever peopl had mention it at the airport thought wed check it out sinc it was close to scottsdale

now as a californian i hate smoker  hate is a strong word  total appropri in this case  i am probabl bother by smoke mani time more than the averag californian  in fact when i was a kid i use to pretend to cough my lung out while walk around vega at the sightsmel of a smoker  realli dislik place where they allow indoor smoke in phoenix downtown we would smell cigarett smoke almost everywher we walk sinc they had to smoke outsid  dont peopl know that they can save themselv 3000 year for kick the smoke and starbuck daili habit probabl more with the healthcar they have to pay when smoke lead to cancer etc  sigh 

sunday dinner buffet was a great deal at 2095 per person

servic was prompt your drink order arriv quick when you get up to do round 2 or 3 of the buffet your plate is clear within a minut or two their select of tea are peet tea 

so mani dessert i walk in tri to focus on what to eat befor dessert  all i see are plate of pie cake mini parfaitspud the gelato station banana foster station
 
the soup were okay i had the viniagrett tomato oliv salad that was refresh put some chicken dark meat honey smoke salmon mash potato with gravi veggi ravioli potato salad etc dont rememb everyth i ate the asian station didnt look appet though

they didnt have prime rib but the beef brisket was delish

mi favorit dessert was the banana cream pie  i want anoth piec but couldnt do that to myself  the chocol browni with walnut was also an indulg  the littl cup were pretti but not worth grab mini fruit tart were yummy

w also notic that some peopl ate a short dinner so that they could get back to gambl haha 

35 starouch it realli pain me to do this but after a recent sting at peter yard i dont think i can keep come here as often

i mean i could but then i might have to stop buy new cloth and other food pretti much just live off one main meal a day at peter and mayb also onli afford makeup and shampoo and soap everi second month

ok that a tad extrem but when my most recent lunch here one open salmon and one pot of tea  came to £10 i was shock and hurt peter weve had a good run ive been come here regular for 2 year sinc i move to edinburgh i eat lunch here at least onc a week and if not that then a caked with a friend ive laud the wonder of your sourdough pizza to everyon i know ive bought takeaway cake as cheerup present for friend countless time i even bought your soup until i discov it was £650 but despit that i came back

and this time the soup was down to £550 but the sandwich were up to £750 yes dear reader £750 for an open smoke salmon sandwich and £250 for a pot of tea so there was no chang from my £10 note

now is it just me be a scroog or is this a step too far i meanreal i tend to onli reserv that much for lunch when it someth like sushi yes the salmon is delici and the bread fresh bake but it just too much

so the food is still delici the café still light and airi it still has all those qualiti that woo me origin but i physic cannot afford to eat here as often as i did bad sad timeyesterday my boyfriend and i came to peter yard for lunch and then i stay on to work from here in the afternoon when we walk in we were just abl to get the last two free seat at a larg share tabl in the back we were there just after 130 and they were down to their last few sandwich and last two serv of soup avail for the day we were a bit surpris at how expens everyth was £5 for soup of the day is a bit steep as is £550 for a glorifi chees sandwich my vegetarian sandwich was good though and what i like best was the sunni environ with natur light stream through the mani floortoceil glass window on three side of the cafe i think what peter yard make best is everyth come from it toprat bakeri and from it coffe machines

so i stay on to work from here after lunch move to one of the more comfi chair when one open up rather than the tabl where we ate i was a bit surpris that there was no free wifi onli the bt wifi you have to pay for which could have been an issu for me other day but luckili i had some edit to do on paper so i was abl to sit and enjoy the environ while work and then check my work email on my phone it not ideal for someon work from home unless you have work you dont need to do relat to anyth onlin but it work otherwise

mi tips
1 if your come for lunch get here earli to headoff the lunch rush and get the lunch option while theyr still available

2 if work from here again which im sure i will sinc i like the atmospher and natur light so much id probabl not come for lunch but rather come in the middl of the afternoon for coffe and cake that is better on the wallet and also on the abil to find a seat also id onli come to work from here when i know i dont need the internet24 hour of all you can eat meal for 50   great  so so so not

even the most high end hotel particip in this deal serv essenti the same food with a few differ i went to imperi palac harrah and paris

thi is also an exampl of where qualiti suffer due to quantiti  i felt forc to eat meal after meal of cafeteria food after the new of crab leg dessert bar and infinit select wore off eat at buffet of buffet seem more like an oblig than a pleasure

bi the end i was realli realli sad i had to eat at one of these buffetsagain 

but if you are look for volum of susten at a low cost this is the deal for you  as someon who would rather have less more high qualiti food this made me sorta sad35 star round down

when they first introduc this program a coupl year ago it was a great deal 49 all you can eat for 24 hour right on the strip is a steal  for the most part you would onli have to eat at 2 buffet to earn your money back sinc most of them are in the 2030 range

howev fast forward to now they made chang to the rule so the 49 is onli for weekday price if you purchas it on the weekend it will charg you 6570 the qualiti of the buffet have also gone down a lot cost are alway go up and buffet tend to be the most cost effici option so casino still have to balanc out cost and qualiti 

the bacchan buffet at caesar hand down you must tryhowev you pay an extra fee to eat here per visit it 15 for breakfast 20 for lunch and 25 for dinner it onli end up be a 1020 discount from it normal price so that someth to consider

besid baccahan my favorit buffet are the rio and pari one  harrah and flamingo are standard buffet with no standout item and planet hollywood for whatev reason is just a realli shitti buffet and they got rid of the imperi palac aka the quad buffet which didnt matter becaus that buffet is worst then hometown buffet

th reason whi i rate it down becaus i wouldnt eat at half of the buffet if they werent includ on the list mani of the buffet just arent tasti and worth eat at

i dont see much valu in the wristband anymor especi if you are stay on the weekend i rather get in a solid meal at bacchan for breakfastlunch at normal price and enjoy light meal throughout the day ie earl pink etc id still come in for less then the price of a wristband and be more satisfi with the food

howev i still think it a good deal especi if you are a big eater an extra plus if you are stay in ani of the  total reward hotel that particip in the program sinc you can get food and drink whenev you like i stay at rio onc and liter would pop in everi coupl hour for a snack  

so it depend on how much you eat and what your daytim activ entail but one thing is for suresign up and bring your total reward cardif you dont have one you dont get the 5 discount

gluttonijust return home from have dinner here w mom tonight  ive want to tri ocean trail ever sinc i heard about a new sushi place open up at talk stick resort six week ago  the resort open on tax day april 15th and ocean trail was suppos to open a coupl of day after but it first day was actual thursday the 22nd  the sushi menu was discard and was replac by a creolecajun style seafood  specialti includ panroast w a lobsterbas broth finish w tomato cream and gumbo rouxbas stew contain andouill sausag and chicken  you may choos to add chicken shrimp crawfish crabmeat or oyster or a combin of whatev strike your fanci  price start at around 15  the eleg pearliz onepag menu list a few starter such as oystersonthehalfshel 9 12 dozen and less than 18 for a full order and lump crab cocktail 1475 and pei mussel w a garlicwin broth salad half and full order and chowder a new england clam chowder which i sampl and found delici and a corn chowder that look amaz creami and decad the said panroast and gumbo plus 5 approx side of red bean red bean and rice rice and steam collard green  crouton arent housemad nor is the wonderfullybalanc caesar salad dress but the dessert no set menu thus far this week select are chocol cake berri and cream anglais and a key lime tart so youll have to check in week to see what the pastri chef who use to creat pastri for casino arizona mckellip locat creat  if youv ever tri the delight dessert serv at the eagl buffet then you know what shes capabl of

for dinner we had the crab cocktail a small order of caesar salad and berri and creme anglais for dessert  the salad was perfect dress w a nice amount of parmesan toss in the romain lettuc was crisp and the crouton crunchi and light and there werent a gazillion of them either  i feel so cheat when a salad has too mani crouton  i say light on the bread and give me more veggi  the crab cocktail was also veri nice but id have prefer a bit more lump crab and less of the homemad remoulad mayonaissebas w caper celeri onion black pepper dijon mustard and old bay season among other season  the martini glass it came in must have contain 23 remoulad and a 13 of the actual crab  while i wouldnt agre w mom that we could get this and the salad at ani red lobster i did see how pay 15 for this item was a bit too steep  i had notic that the menu at the blue coyot cafe locat on a lower level also offer a lump crab cocktail for 1225 but upon inquiri was told that the host imagin the one serv abov would be more flavor  id like to find out if there is a differ  ill keep you post  we were also serv a big cone of tabl bread and a side of butter  just a plain white bread roll slice and warm but it pair well w the crab cocktail and salad  thank good for the berri and cream  it was the onli item we order that mom didnt shake her head at she thought the menu was overpr  this ambrosi dessert consist of strawberri raspberri blackberri and blueberri sit on a well of creme anglais a rather shallow well i thought and top w homemad whip cream and a veri pleas roll cooki  i inquir about the other two dessert and we realli fell for the descript of the chocol cake a slice of fourlay cake w a chocol ganach fill  mom isnt oppos to come back to tri the cake 

love the bluetil wall marbl round counter and light fixtur abov the bar but have to agre w mom that see the serv bowl open pot and doubleboil and metal food contain did take away from the gourmet dine experi  have to choos to sit at the back of the round counter away from the casino floor and the excit slot machin player also lessen the enjoy of the cool atmospher that ocean trail offer  howev chat w the chef and bartend doe add to the fun experi if you just keep an open mind to enjoy your stay herethis is in my hood and i came in realli want to be wowd by the place but what i didnt expect was a walk down memori lane

servic 101 memori lane

1 alway greet the custom when they enter the restaur bachi burger could realli embrac the hip of the restaur by shout out hello or goodby when peopl enter and leav the restaur choos a languag shout a burger name something
but do no leav the custom stand at the door unsur of seat themselv or waiting

what sad is that there werent busi at the time and even the manag who was by the door didnt greet me he was busi make chang for someon at the regist i know yall can multitask and look up for a split second to smile and say hello well be right with you

2 bus the tabl immediately
it gross to walk into a restaur when there a bunch of dirti tables
again the restaur wasnt busi in fact the waiter told me whew we just got through with the busiest night

great
but just becaus i came at the end of the rush doesnt mean i should have to sit in a dine room of dirti glasswar and dirti tabl 

when i was show to my tabl the waiter paus at 2 tabl befor decid the 3rd tabl was the winner i had to laugh out loud becaus it seem so disorgan to me i think he mistook my laughter and explain the other tabl hadnt been wipe down he was veri sweet and the poor guy tri to explain his way out of not greet me and the dirti tables

what realli got me was that the waitstaff physic express their tired from the rush by lean on tabl stretch in the dine room and squat to stretch their legs
hey gang do that in the kitchen where the custom cant see you
bett yet get a move on and get the dine room clean up

3 know the menu
 never been here so when i ask the waiter what do you recommend and you look at me blank and say the burger youv total lost point with me burger is in the name of the restaur i know the burger are suppos to be good but which one whi what in it what your favorit your the freakin expert you got train right

4 dont sweep the floor in front of me when im eating
wer not at mcdonald 

5 be attent to your tabl and the one around you if your go to help a fellow waiter out know where the guest are in their meal i had a waiter tri to take the plate i was eat from three separ time realli im still eat your cute and sweet but go away

learn to read the tabl you dont have to come ask me everi 5 minut if im okay you can tell if im okay by walk by the tabl and observ if i make eye contact and look like i need you then come over

6 sens of urgenc yeah the rush may be over but there still work to do watch a waiter mull around a dine room is unnerv it about as fun as walk into a store and watch the shop girl gossip with each other instead of servic the custom and get readi for more customers

fin for the food

i had the kurobuta sausag appet and the sausag were cook perfect with a slight crisp skin that click as your teeth pierc through i could have use more mustard though the last 2 sausag were eaten dri becaus there wasnt ani more mustard in the dish

th truffl fri were good when the kitchen went heavier on the truffl the second tri 

pork belli steam bun were an unusu twist on the peke duck bun the horseradish sauc was pretti good with it but i particular like dip the slice boil egg in it

what was most memor to me was the cherri yuzu soda i love it it was delici id come back just for the soda

th potenti to be great is total here nice peopl work here but they need better train they dont realiz theyr do anyth wrong

if i could see and tast past the servic the food is good but onc a guest has a sour tast in her mouth becaus of the servic it hard to get past it

i know these guy are new and work out the kink i realli want to love this place so ill come back in a month or so to see if the servic has chang and when i do ill updat this reviewi like it  there no doubt about that but i guess it just wasnt what i was look for  i love japanes cuisin and i enjoy pursu the elus betterthaninnout perfect burger  i onli tri the ronin burger and the oxtail chili chees fri but i wasnt left with the idea that i would be back  my bill came to about 25 without tip  the novelti wore off veri quickly

youl enjoy your experi howev  the restaur itself was veri busylo angel will have one of it own this fall 2012and the staff was veri person and all smile  the food is a new and refresh twist on the sometim commonplac hamburg and the present are eyecatch as you would expect with a japanes influenc  myself i thought what i had order which was high recommend by our server and host was too sweet  i was expect to bite into someth that was much more robust  again i hadnt tri everyth but for now it been there done thati guess i dont get it

everyth was wholli averag burger servic pricesaverag i order kiki burgeraverag some bite were over sweet but the mushroom ad a good savori touch i had the garlic friesaverag they trick you into think your get an fton of fri and your get about a handful

also their hostess kept seat peopl direct next to us too which was kind of irrit consid the restaur was near empti twice the other diner ask to be move so they werent join us for our meal

id have to be drag backto me it not worth a revisitbewar of the servic here on weekend yes you drove your ass all the way over here and now there a 4575 min wait but you know what the food is amaz and they know it and they will use that to their advantage

th hostess realli know how to make your experi a shitti one no smile veri stern voic and absolut no common sens we had to wait next to an empti tabl for 4 for about 30 min while she was build a tabl for a bigger parti there was no sorri for the wait or thank for your patienc but onc you get past her incompet it smooth sail from there

food is great you must order the oxtail chili fri that is the onli reason i will put up with the crappi hostess ive tri most of the burger and they have all been mouth water the best part is that each burger will come with their own littl surpris that will have you ask excus me what is this and what is it for youll understand when you see it022111

came here after read linda ws delight review  had the green tea gyoza potstick beef and pork egg noodl combo and a strawberri boba shake  the gyoza app was good though the six piec were too small to share but they were definit much better than those id found at china magic noodl hous  the noodl dish was good prefer the bbq pork over the beef piec but the leftov werent as good i threw them out after the first bite  the homemad boba shake was a veri nice surpris creami and a bit too sweet for me so i stop after about a third of it  mani of the boba tapioca round were too big to pass through the straw and that straw was huge as straw go and that was anoth reason for me to quit tri  what i didnt like was find a bit of plastic in my mouth after take a big slurp the shake was made on site then mechan top w a plastic wrap cover that had to be broken w a straw in order to drink out of the cup blech  have written all that id order anoth shake in the futur and ill be sure to share it w a friend or two35 star  somewhat reminisc of sidebar this place has potenti id ventur to say ad a happi hour is about all i need to bump it to 4 star of cours a crowd would be cool too but im sure the owner want that even more than i do so get out there guy 

last night i enjoy a scrumptious keylim martini 8 which went down way too easi and a glass of hey mambo 8 snack categori rang from bruschetta 3 a piec to hous made potato chip 3 pizza and nacho to hummus and grill veggi most 89 

we order the potato chip which were well salt and not too greasi but they were a littl slow to come from the kitchen which appear to be share with it sister il posto 

the loung offer a chill vibe in addit to the funki furnitur and light fixtur magic 8 ball are scatter through the room  fun convers starter 

morri j is right the beer select is mediocr but if your look for a cocktail or a glass of wine this place is a real neighborhood gemone of downtown first day time place to hang out and around the corner from vega new godfath toni hsieh ogdenthi hip littl coffe hous drip with histori this build was onc a jc penni then a medic build paint concret floor and old vinyl character this histor hipster hangout
they offer an extens lunch menu and the delici garlic aroma made our mouth water dure our downtown project tour for a coffe hous they need to have real coffe machin as they look silli pump coffe order out of a larg thermo expect an extra long wait for food order even have what look like a full staff the pace is slow we wait 45 minut after we were told it would be 15 minut for a tuna sandwich and bake mac  chees that still came out cold in the middl food was ok but definit not worth the wait time park downtown also not the easiest hope with the revit there will be more competit nearbi to make the beat come up to par0908 and 0929

on my first visit here i order egg roll and a stirfri beef noodl dish  it was such fun to watch noodl be made that i couldnt wait to bring mom over so that she could see it herself  servic was friend and help and the place and restroom look veri clean

real love the egg roll  theyr so good im go to have to order them everi time i visit  the noodl were good but the meat portion of this dish was pretti dismal the noodl to meat ration had to have been at least 3 to 1  no exagger  i had hope it was a fluke but it wasnt more detail to come later  onc id exhaust the beef content and there wasnt much i wasnt satisfi enough w the noodl flavor to continu  if onli the noodl were as tasti as those id tri at saigon bowl the night befor  there was no doubt howev that these noodl were fresh made  i realli enjoy it texture

took mom w me on my second visit  decid to tri the steam gyoza and a noodl dish w ground pork  wish id order the eggrol instead   the gyoza dish was without question the worst wed ever tri  too heavi on the batter and steam was definit not the way to go  onc you have a look at the photo youll agre  same thing w the pork  too crumbl and unexcit flavor salti and lemoni and again the meat to noodl ratio was veri low  

two visit and it hit1 miss1  at least ill know that the app will be a hit egg roll and if i rememb to order a doubl or a tripleserv of meat mayb the noodl portion wont be a misssunday night we decid to have dinner with a coupl friend at stk locat at the cosmopolitan hotel in las vega let me tell you it was probabl the strangest dinner i have ever been to i felt like i was in some type of music video or commerci the patron and server were so over satur with enthusiasm that there had to be a director near by yell action from the top of his lung i mean he had to yell becaus you couldnt hear your own thought over the music the dj had stream over everi tabl and like clockwork he had an ultraannoy horn blow ever few minut as if that were not enough everi few second there was a voic remind us that the guy control the sound was a worldclass dj there were girl fistpump server danc while pour wine and peopl grind between tabl i think i actual rub my eye to make sure i was not dream i grew up in vega by way of the militari my dad was in the air forc i dont know if las vega has alway been like this or i can now see how semicheesi it is whatev the case peopl were have fun and that was nice more pic on my blogthe stk in las vega is a close second to the stk in miami it is not as big as the miami locat so the loungebar area is basic in the same area as the dining area 

gener the lv stk is fun on monday for industri night but peopl dont usual eat it more of a drink social event to mix it up we came to the lv stk with a group of eight peopl at 1100pm on a saturday night we had reserv and the restaur was pack 

it definit has a fun loud vibe so if your look for a quiet romant restaur this stk is not for you unless you come befor the music get loud 

the hostess was fabul servic was good and the food was delicious

her is whi i knock it two stars

1 there were middleag women danc on top of the booth that fine in a nightclub or even stks loung area or even at someon els booth who is ok with it but they were danc on top of our booth which was not ok i was disgust at the idea of sit in the booth while these women danc right where our head were rest with their dirti bare feet total disgust i polit motion to one of them and said hi this our tabl we are sit here with a smile she look at me and said so i was so surpris at this rude middleag woman respons that i didnt know what to say for a moment luckili the hostess slid in and shoo them away comment how rude they were needless to say it took a few cocktail for me to regain my appetit if stk want to promot a nightclub vibe do it where patron wont be eat or atleast impos some standard on who you will have up there danc our parti spent over 700 food and alcohol and for that money i dont want the experi of dirti middleag housewivesreject danc around my head as i eat

2 i order the 7 oz filet mignon mediumrar it arriv near welldon no pink whatsoev howev to stks credit the server was immedi apologet and when my second steak arriv it was perfectto make this review authenticim shouting

it too loud what i cant hear you in this club this steak is delici what did you say the oyster are yummi huh what nevermindthere was a lot of hype build up to our last yelp gettogeth and group nome at los cardo i think that may be the reason whi i was a littl less in love with my chicken bowl than i thought i would be but i think perhap i also order the least flavour option on the menu

th good los cardo is a takeaway with a few seat but main takeaway burrito bar that doe texmex well so i am told by american and mexican alik you can order a burrito fajita quesidilla or even just a bowl of the fill without the wrap  nice touch

chicken beef carnita veggi two type of bean rice chees four type of salsa which realli are epic and rice done 

i got in touch in advanc to let them know a larg group  may be descend on them need fed and they were realli help and love they suggest i book a space at the victoria bar a few door down as they dont mind peopl take in their los cardo food if they buy a drink veri handi to know so i was impress by how friend they were as were the staff in the shop normal take away staff can be rush and are use to act like postclub polic to drunk these guy were cool

a i said i had the chicken i could see it in the contain about to be serv and alreadi felt disappoitn tini cube of what look like veri dri process chicken the carnita was pull hot pork in a delici sweet marinad yes i got to tri some the chicken was dri a bit flavourless and i actual felt a bit outoflov with my dinner option as it was the main substanc to it bean and bean and rice are rice the save grace was the salsa verd which i was high recommend and which was realli good

i think i order the wrong thing a carnita burrito with extra hot salsa would have had me weak at the knee and it doe pain me a littl to give this place onli 3 star but my order realli was just aok not aw i ate and enjoy it for the most part and do recognis it quit a rare thing to find in the uk scotland let alon edinburgh  good tex mex next time it carnita for me and next time i might be a happier bunnii have had takeaway from here 3 time  you can sit in but it realli design as a take out joint
th 1st order we place was simpli bland  not what you expect from a mexican i
had the burrito and order the mildest one as i was unsur how hot it maymay not be
you get a decent portion but i was expect more tast 2nd time we order it was much 
better a littl more spici and much more tasti 3rd attemptback to be tastless 
the sour cream doesnt have much tast to it and all n all i think it okay but veri much a hit or a misscall all vegan gluten free vegetarian and those who enjoy eat healthi nourish is probabl your garden of eden hidden within the optima nourish is a health food fan paradis the environ is fresh and clean and so is the food 

upon walk insid i notic how calm and refresh the restaur was everyon had the same calm attitud and i could tell that this is a restaur you visit to relax and still feel healthi when you leav the menu is detail but not overwhelm the onli overwhelm part was tri to deciph what each icon indic and soon i learn that most of the food is gluten free vegan vegetarian or some other food lifestyl other than carnivor but for those not follow an altern food lifestyl it still incred tasti and make me rethink my cuisin decis 

nourish serv breakfast all day bonus as well as lunch it a great brunch spot the egg benedict is spot on i cant tell what sort of herb or tweak they add to the hollaindas sauc but it doesnt tast like your typic egg benedict their breakfast sandwich is tasti as well but a littl bit more on the dri and healthi side their ingredi are fresh as is their produc if they push the cinnamon roll on you it becaus it like a cinnamon god proteg and worth everi calori consum plus it flow with frost 

nourish has a great patio for dine as well as spacious seat insid but the patio is cover enough that even on a hot day it comfort to sit outsid 

so in summari nourish is a good choic if your look for a healthi meal that will fill you up i will absolut be back and i cant wait to tri some of the lunch item that look tasti 

note be sure to check the time befor visit nourish i was surpris to find out that they open at 1100 on saturday but 900 on sundayjust a quick updat on nourish sinc it been over a year sinc my initi review
 
first thing first  im so happi that nourish has surviv for over a year now in this economi and with their slight high price  ive been back a hand of time over the year and for the most part ive enjoy my meal there even if my pocket book has not  

mi favorit menu item is the sweet potato and avocado salad  i like their lemonad  arnold palmer as well and i enjoy the salmon when i order it recent  

if you are search for someth healthi and have ani diet restrict the beauti of nourish is that they will work with you to find exact what your look for  howev if you dont have diet restrict or crave you can like find someth just as delici and more moder price elsewhere

al of that said nourish seem to have a nich market and ill continu to pop in everi now and again for a healthi meal or when my bodi is ask for that sweet potato avocado saladhave paid 175 advanc on the ticket i was hope for a bit more than just pate on a cracker  there was a nice varieti of restaur and a great divers of food but it was extrem one side as far as the crowd went  

and appar we were one of the few coupl that actual paid for ticket sinc the particip casino were pass out freebi to their high roller with might explain some of the charact that were in attend  im pretti sure 14 of the women there were work the crowd which great for them but a littl bit of a dress code might have been advised

it was a great way to experi realli good food and restaur we might want to tri in the futur and those we will def never spend a 100 in  

mi particular fave were fleur de lys mesa grill bobbi flay has as mani freckl as i do and craftsteak  i love the cru wineand i need to find a bottl or 3  

given the abund of freebi like everi person we talk to didnt pay we felt kind of sheepish to have fork over about 40000 for this  

i dont think well go back again even though it was fun and great surround122110

came in w mom and a cowork and we sat at the counter  weve heard that select sushi roll were 12 off dure happi hour 3p7p monday through friday but we saw noth on the short menu that we want to tri  i decid to order the bbq bacon burger and a seawe salad while mom and cowork order seawe salad and a rainbow roll to share

hav you ever tri a seawe salad befor  we have and weve had them from mani japanesesushi restaur but never have we seen them serv w carrot and cucumb befor  until now  weve also never seen them without sesam seed  let hope that this was a fluke or els id question the qualiti of sushi that this kitchen produc  needless to say the seawe salad werent good i took one bite and decid to pass on the salad and wait for my burger to arriv  the other two remov the nonauthent item and ate the seawe even though they also didnt particular care for them  the rainbow sushi that came after look veri dri so i didnt even sampl it  mom and cowork both remark that it was tasteless and dry

thank good that the burger entre was delici  i order it with bbq sauc on the side and to be honest i didnt miss it  the patti was thick and juici and i appreci the crispi thickslic applewoodsmok bacon  i dont know which i like better the burger or the season wedg fri  these remind me sour cream  onion potato chip yum

i may go back and give happi hour sushi anoth tri but i wouldnt mind have more of those frii had breakfast here one morn while stay at the talk stick resort  we were lucki enough to score an outsid seat in the sun  be from seattl it was so nice to enjoy breakfast in 80 degre weather in march  

i order the belgian waffl with fruit on top   it was good but unbeliev sweet  the egg and bacon all came out good  but in the end the food was just ok  noth blew me away   our waiter was veri nice an attent  but the rest of the staff kind seem like they were just droid do work on autoi do not claim to be an expert on eastern european food or anyth close  we tri sever item includ all the one that the menu recommend with their littl icon  in the end they were all ediblefil our stomachsprovid for some nice convers piecesbut didnt leav anyon in our group want to run back anytim soon

i would have shell out 2 star on the food alon  the thing is though that even though fort is tri a littl too hard to be cool and invit they are do a better job with their atmospher than a lot of place around

th drink from the bar are aok as well  i went a littl safe with a moscow mule and i could enjoy one or two again sometim if i ever found myself here again5 of us met again to tri a new restaur and tri differ food  i have had fort bookmark for about 2 year but i never seem to think of this place  

we were seat at two high top tabl right as you come in the door  while we were look at the menu and talk about other thing we were approach for our order  we ask her to wait awhil as we kept studi what we wanted

w were soon brought some bread  they were larg round puff larger and flatter than a doughnut  there was oliv oil on the tabl and we pull piec off the bread to dip in the oil  it was good

our thing start come out  the first plate was a share spanish nacho platter  it consist of some chip with thin chorizo slice and top with a tasti truffl salsa

w were brought two order of meat pie that were also good  next came a dish stuf babi squid serv over spanish herb rice  

we also order each of their specialti breadsa feta chees stuf filo dough round and adjarski khachapurri describ as tradit georgian boat shape bread fill with two type of georgian style pickl chees and a crack egg mix on top after our photo  both were good bread  it was difficult cut the georgian bread with the egg but we manag to mangl it enough that everyon got a chanc to tri some  the filo round was easi  all we had to do was pull a piec of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we want  the bread was brought straight from the oven becaus it was extrem hot

w had two order of almond stuf bacon wrap date with a sherri reduct  the date were ok but i thought they were cook a bit too much

next came some easter or spring lamb with some mash potato and some salad  i didnt think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor i was expect and it was in a dark sauc  i guess im too use to have lamb rare and not done in a stew manner  it was extrem tender

w close out this part of lunch with the thracian clay pot describ on the menu as a tradit bulgarian specialti of tomato pepper onion feta bulgarian style charcuteri and egg bake in a bulgarian clay pot  for me this was the stand out of our lunch  it had lot of flavor  i use some of the spice on the tabl to give it some extra flavor  on the tabl was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon  the woman told us that it was a mixtur of 40 spice with cumin garlic salt and  we didnt ask her to continue

then dessert was order  we got some baklava and their biscuit cake  the biscuit cake was the star  the menu describ it as decad cake layer with honey biscuit mascarpon rich chocol lavazza espresso and a kick of spice rum top with walnut and more chocol  need i write ani more  the baklava was not like im use to in how it made but it was ok

i thought the food was pretti good  i want to give the place more star but the part that held me back was the servic  we had ask at the start not to bring all the dish out but they just kept comingnot all at oncebut close enough togeth that there wasnt a chanc to rest a bit between tast  the number of plate and fit them on our two tabl becam a bit of an issu  instead of give us clean plate period we had the same one until the main cours were complet  we got clean plate for dessert  we also had to ask twice to get more water  for such a small place with two server at least thing should have been done better  

i might go back to tri one of the other main dish  and of cours get some more biscuit cake should alway be foremost in my mind

liter hidden by a gate patio in a stripmal on rainbow but featur in numer public as well as diner dive and drivein fort european tapa had been of interest to me even befor move to las vega and recent opt to open it full menu for lunch a visit was plan  six person cram into a small hightop near the front door for a multicours meal mar by hassl servic and uneven culinari techniqu throughout  small in size and kitsch in décor with heavi wood accent by poster graffiti and christma light as american pop play overhead it was less than sixtysecond after the final member of our parti arriv that order were request and have twice defer onli to be given the first of two strainer of warm bread a somewhat rush order was place with a request for item to be appropri pace  a concept that along with beverag refil prove as foreign as the food with the tabl soon overburden and servicewar for share few and far between  opt for special and stapl from divers region includ spain greec and nation of the former soviet union it was with odd truffl storebought potato chip mix with dri chorizo that our tast began and roll next into the duo of oili chebureki and overcook date prop up by an outstand sherri reduct it was with good fortun that the meal would soon improv the tender whole squid restuf with their tentacl and cook in ink subt sweet over aromat rice  left precious second to digest and discuss a second wave of food soon smother the tabl onc more and find far more success than round one both of the bread prove superl with big flavor and a pleasant degre of grassi funk that i onli wish had been present in the tender but flavorless lamb a special by titl onli and complet forgotten compar to the bombast mélang of meat chees and veget aromat contain in the clay pot  at this point sate but happi to finish with someth sweet twopart each of baklava and biscuit cake round out the afternoon with the former benefit not by lemon nor liber appli simpl syrup while the latter prove exquisit a delic balanc of crunch and cream with mild sweet harken tiramisu but dress up with honey and nut that were perhap stolen from the baklava and use here to better effecti was amaz how larg the place was onc insid and how quick they were abl to seat me even though they appear busi  i had my drink order in quick and was review their menu within minut of sit down

i order the ayc which is a great price of 20 especi given the major of the roll were 10 or more each  i order 5 in total so it was a great deal for the quantiti of food i receiv the qualiti howev was just about averag to mayb a littl better  the present of the food was bland and onc my initi order was in it took sever attempt to stop my waitress even though the place had clear out complet by then

i felt a littl uncomfort have to keep ask for more tea and wait almost 20 minut after ask for the bill  the food was good for 20 ayc howev the servic wasnt  i will give them anoth tri in a few month as i could have caught them on a bad night but for 20 and the fact i was stuf when i left it is worth anoth trias the chosen restaur for the yelp christma dinner i had high hope ador tradit british gastropub that serv cocktail in teapot alongsid banger and mash yes please

in the process of book the tabl of 20 peopl which turn out to be their entir dine area the staff were incred help and friend patient when wait for order so big kudo to the staff for preevent arrang and also servic on the night there were 20 of us they stagger the meal well and kept us all well fed

th pub itself seem to be realli popular with the local and other parti when we arriv a wed parti were fill the bar it has charm it oldworld but like i said doe cocktail in tea pot which are call pottail not the other way of fuse the two word which i blurt out without thinking

th salamand slapper that catriona c and i share was quit nice were talk pottail here although i couldnt realli tast the alcohol or feel the effect there was a lot of ice in it but good for the novelti value

it doe pain me to then lower the star somewhat and give an aok review the food itself is where i was a littl let down we all had to preorder our meal off the christma menu i went for the smoke salmon starter and then the haddock with oat risotto applewood and a happi egg now on the menu that seem to be haddock with risotto not risotto with haddock

so when the main arriv and the waitress ask who order the risotto i thought uh oh i dont like risotto much but was will to sacrific it as a side for a delici piec of haddock and a happi poach egg what arriv was a bowl of risotto with a few wee bit of haddock on top and a poach egg that was over poach so wasnt runny

th risotto be oat tast entir of porridg it was as aidan put it veri well glutin over fill and bland the fact that it was in abowl and the haddock was on top meant there was no space to cut the haddock apart from on the risotto so the haddock tast of porridg and the unrunni poach egg gave no yolk to mask the flavour see upload photo

th result was like eat a big bowl of porridg with fish and egg weird bland

luckili i was abl to share a littl of kay ls butternut squash and nut wellington which was far more flavour and the pork belli disappear faster than you can say cockpot damnit i just said it again didnt i and the beef pie look amaz see all upload photos

th smoke salmon starter was realli great the salmon in such thick slice and the chocol tart i tri witha soufflé consist was nice but as louis c said there were no coffe or minc pie after yes we make consess that it christma so it might be slight higher price buti did come away just feel a wee bit disappoint with my main option 

id be will to give roseleaf anoth go base on other good review and photo ive seen the burger look epic it  agreat cosi wee pub too i was just a littl let down by my main and had a wee bit of a sore tummi for the rest of the night becaus of it i want to like roseleaf i do and i will come back just pleas dont serv me porridg with fishok so here is my obligatori review onli becaus i go here more than i want to i am a carnivor so this place is definit not on my top place to eat list i have 4 main reason whi i come here 1 is becaus my wife love salad 2 and 3 becaus my two kid love mac and chees along with the chicken noodl soup last 4 becaus everi so often i over indulg in have some kind of meat fest whether it a larg ribey or at a buffet like korean barbequ or brazillian so i tend to feel kind of guilti so salad is in order

so if you ask me where and what to eat i will  never mention this place ever 
but for you salad eater i can see whi this would be heaven for you as soon as you step foot in the place you grab a plate or two throw it on a tray then off you go to the long buffet bar full of all sort of vegetables

then you pay and your off on your merri way to go find a tabl or booth to sit down if you join their email club they send you coupon special and promo also if you look in the newspap everi now and then they have 2 for 1 special when it realli pack you have to wait for a host to find you a seat

onc you sit down you have other choic like differ soup bread pasta etc everi month they usual have differ theme like lemon month which mean a lot of the item have some kind of lemon influenc like lemon cake or pomegran lemonad fusions

som random info they have these card thingi at your tabl that indic if you took off to go get more food or if you are done so the busser know whether to clean your whole tabl or not these guy are the same as soup plantat in southern california dont forget dessert they have frozen yogurt you serv yourself

so from my point of view my famili love it here which make it ok for me

wooooo that onli mean an even bigger headach for heidi c w kaskad music  i just hearunsa unsa unsa unsa unsa unsa

thi is the same area as surrend nightclub so instead of leav surrend at 4am when they kick us out they should have just let us sleep by the pool then when encor beach club kick off in the am let us strip off our clubbin outfit down to our food babi or alcohol babi show bikini and let us continu the fun but nope we had to leav and come back 

ladi  free on guestlist
guy  50  lol no joke 

anyway drink are still just as expens blackjack and crap tabl arent in oper tabl servic start at around a 700 min i believ and there no where to sit expect  on the stair in the pool this is where your skin can get pruney 

but heyat least the water isnt murki like at tao beachwent to encor beach club on sunday afternoon 

there was a huuug line of peopl wait to get inluckili we were on the guest list honest i recommend you peopl find a guest list you go through a separ line they have ice water for you and it a lot shorter and quicker theyr veri well organ love it wait mayb 10 minut 

got in item check and off we went it was realli nice and calvin harri was perform that day we overheard that their cabana are 6k im sorri butholi fuckin shizthat ridicul they have these small circl couch there as well and that is 3k and if you want to have a seat at the bar that onli yours1k redonkul sorri i aint ballin like that 

anway we make our way to the pool and it felt good onc you get inbut after sit in there for a while it a littl disgust it just luke warm becaus of all the other peopl chillin i felt a littl uncomfi just stand in the water 

on stay for about an hour it realli was noth excit to me just normal 

mi friend and her bf stay for calvin harri and they said it was pretti damn good 

i still had fun generalbeauti spot super fun howev it all didnt start all that well went there edc weekend and had reserv a tabl in advanc for 1300 got to the place and was told that all the tabl for 1300 had sold out  this is after have confirm a reserv some short douchi littl wannab surfer dude with a clipboard came and said well we can still get you a tabl if you give me 300 wasnt happi to hear all this and hes like while you think about it you can get out of the line we decid to just say f it and pay the 300 but now hes tell me to get to the back of the line and that with an attitud like hes steve wynn himself i understand you have to be assert in those situat but guest of the hotel shouldnt be treat this way special after have confirm reserv and now be told to pay extra 300 even though we show up way befor time 

long stori short it a awesom fun place great djs bewar of the staff as they will tri to drain everi singl dollar you have to get you absolut noth im sure im not the first or last person this has or will happen to 

buy ticket in advanc and stand in line way cheaper dont worri about bottl servic unless your will to spend upward of 5k we end up with a 2700 bill for 6 of us and our tabl was in a dark desol corner we were too fade to care then but look back at it it was a rip off pre sale is the way to go even with 17 drink you wont spend anywher close to the tabl as far as the status that come with a tabl there none unless your in a prime locat and those are upward of 5ki would give them 4 star if not for our previous visit ive onli been to squid ink a coupl of time and will like tri it again howev the most recent visit left myself and other in the parti conflict about this establish 

the first time we tri it the servic was good  friend attent help and also veri knowledg the food was also good i wouldnt ventur to say spectacular as i am a bit of a sushi snob but for this part of town it as fresh as ive had and it was execut attract and the flavor were great there was one roll that we regret order i believ it was the yellowtail scallion roll as it was complet bland  read  had no flavor whatsoev howev the other roll realli made up for it the nigiri was also fresh and flavor  which is my favorit part of go out for sushi i was also delight by the basil grapefruit martinireason price compar to what you would pay elsewher mani of the review rave about the cougar roll  it is good inde it refresh and light im not a huge fan of tempura roll but i realli enjoy the jib roll as well and the spici yellowtail was delici  nice and spici yet you could still tast the fish and dont miss out on the garlic edamameyou wont be abl to stop eat it until it gone 

nowth second visit after a love visit the first time a famili member decid to have her birthday dinner there grant we had a larg parti  10 patron this restaur isnt huge but it isnt a hole in the wall either we had to wait for space which is complet understand but the wait was reason and they accommod us without ani problem howev we watch them wipe down the tabl that we would be sit at and it was done so poor that one of the peopl in the parti liter had to get a bar rag themselv to clean the tabl  becaus when he ask an employe for help they did noth also they did not have enough small plate or sauc dish for our tabl which wasnt a huge deal but you would think they would be more proactiv about do dish on a saturday night they also ran out of water glass so most of the parti didnt have ani water until about 25 minut after be seat 

onc again the food was good  noth to complain about there which is good otherwis i wouldnt even give them 3 star the problem was realli with the servic the first thing said to us by the server was it go to be fine to put this all on one check right as someon who has spent most of their life in the servic industri i was dumbfound move onsh realli did tri hard a 10top is a lot of work as anyon in the restaur industri know overwhelm probabl shouldnt bebut it realli was on this night when we first came in all the tabl in the dine room were occupi and they had sever server handl it onc we were sat there were a few other tabl and us  but they cut the other server or so it seem  our server was the onli one left work the dine room whi did they leav it to one server to handl 3 tabl and a larg parti piti plan and it show 

almost all of the food was correct between all of us we order 7 yellowtail nigiri nobodi at the tabl order yellowtail sashimi when the order were read back to us yellowtail nigiri is what was read howev when the first 5 came out  we were given five order of yellowtail sashimi wow that was a lot of food that we didnt order we point out to the server that we had all order nigiri and she quick said oh im sorri it must have gotten mix up then we ask her to make sure that the next two came out as nigiri not sashimi at that point we hadnt even gotten to the point of be concern about be well overcharg for someth we didnt order we decid as a group to just eat it and pay for what came out until the next two came out as sashimi as well at this time she then apolog again and state that we wouldnt be charg for the sashimi as it was a mixup okay fine  we will deal with it 

when the bill camewa the issu rectifi at all as promis absolut not we were charg for 7 order of sashimi when nigiri is what we order  i think it was rough a 35ish differ on a bill of over 500 i guess it not that substanti but it should have been fix 

if onli one or even two neget thing would have happen that night it definit wouldnt have been so bad but between the tabl dish  server issu the offput greet the orderkitchen mixup the failur to rectifi it and the disregard for do so it was disappointgreat happi hour here  if you are in the area and want to tri some sushi roll and drink this is the spot  i enjoy some sushi and even went bold and tri the wing  the waitress inform me they use imit crab in most of it so i was fine with what i ordered

i am allerg to shell fish so shrimp and crab are a nono  i did enjoy the imit crab meat without ill effect  so i guess im ok go here  i was not impress with the roll howev not realli good not realli bad  

i also did tri the buffalo wing but mine seem over salti i did tri to eat 3 and drank 2 glass of water to accomplish that  i can say i took them home bath them in barbecu sauc and that sweet got rid of the salti  

i did like the cucumb slice in my water and the great outdoor seat  on a nice day you can enjoy the weather and busy of the locat  

i would go again with an invit but not on my radar for must eat in the futurbrand new 101 here hit the ground run this morn at 10 am  it a big pretti place featur sushi made while you watch  i count up 88 food item plus sauc  dressings

aft land in a comfort booth i start with their hot  sour soup which was delici  had meat in it someth i alway appreci  there were most of the regular item that we have come to expect at a goodsiz chines buffet  here are a few more tast that stood out for me

  excel salad bar with six dress choices

  delici bonein bbq pork spare ribs

  big tasti bread fri shrimp

  scallop on the halfshel with a shrimp thrown in too just for fun

  oyster on the halfshell

  your choic of sever flavor of real ice cream

so here an fun new chines buffet in north phoenix  3 12starfound this new buffet to be averag at best

sur it pretti cleannow but it new just give it a few year and im sure itll fall right into line with it peers

th food had way too mani item design to pleas the picki american 4 year old  there was a high greasi factor to mani dish and despit what seem at first glanc to be a larg select all of it was just  blah

ther are so mani of these boofay pop up that instead of see them as all the same the differ  both subtl and glare  will be all the more evident

101 is nowher near the top of the list of chines buffet choic in the valley or even in the immedi area unless mayb you are within walk distanc then mayb it the best in the immedi areaive been here a coupl of time  each time ive had difficulti order becaus it is just so confus  it kind of like chipotl but they have a ton more option and it not quit clear what those option are  i think you just have to lean against the glass and grunt i want that  veri stoner

 tri the chicken tostada bowl chronic fri a batter shrimp taco and a carn asada taco  the chicken tostada was ok but it came with a pathet amount of sour cream and they left off the guacamol i order  but i dont think they charg me for it either  the chronic fri basic cover in everyth includ salsa were pretti damn good though  for whatev reason these are advertis on their websit but are not on the menu

th carn asada seem to be their claim to fame but i didnt like it  too salti  then again i got the veri last bit of carn asada  they were out by 6pm  so mayb i didnt get the best represent of this dish be the last littl bit they had and all  also he ask me if i want it baja style  i said sure and that was a big mistak  mayo cabbag doesnt realli work with carn asada for me  howev the shrimp taco baja style  excellent

they have dos equi and blue moon on tap  3 a pint  the bar was complet empti  im not sure if it is worth it for this place to have a liquor license

im will to tri this place again and mayb get some booz  but i need to have a heart to heart with the staff and get the low down on the menuthe greatest luxuri at this starbuck isnt comfort seat complimentari wifi or premium coffe the luxuri at this starbuck it is across aliant parkway from the aliant natur discoveri park duck pond this is the las vega starbuck by the duck pond

  everytim i visit this starbuck it was befor or after the duck pond in the cold winter month it is nice to quaff a warm coffe after the duck pond or to carri it to the duck pond and wake up with the ducki in the hot month of summer month it is relax to quaff a refresh frapucinno after the duck pond or at the duck pond 

  when i walk toward the starbuck i could see the 215 and aliant station hotel  casino as i type this aliant station is in need of a starbuck type of establish when the starbuck crave hit this is the goto locat for aliant station the 215 is the divid wall between aliant station and a cup of starbuck it is the furthest starbuck eastbound on the north segment of the 215 toward interst 15 when i pull into this park lot i maneuv through the infrastructur of a shop center surround starbuck is a modern shop center that includ smith  arbi sierra gold 7eleven and a gym in other word it is a conveni starbuck 

  insid the lobbi is alway clean when i visit the lobbi is on the small side this isnt a negat becaus i could turn it into a posit by drink my beverag across aliant parkway by the ducki the barista have been friendly

 i appreci place that are upbeat and give me a caffein boost when i visit the ducki at aliant natur discoveri park i will also be visit the green mermaidstarbucki got the snicker cupcak and the coconut macaroon the cupcak was gross and dri but the truffl chocol top was good i wish there was a littl more snicker tast to the cupcak the coconut macaroon was pretti good it was caramel and grill or fri my friend deliber for 30 minut on buy a hello kitti lollipop for 25 buck  way overpr the sugar factori locat in front of the pari las vega hotel  casino

so mani candi that my head is go to explod and my teeth are go to fall out

great place to check out if you have a sweet tooth or just look for some giftim prepar for yelper to come to my hous with pitchfork and giant log threaten to tear down my door and have my head but ill admit that i was not blown away

i have been ach to tri the nutella latt forev and when i did today it seem like just a regular latt not hazelnutti not chocolatey just a latt meh i want someth so rich and thick that i couldnt guzzl it down but i guzzl it like i could ani other latt and it was 450 eep i want to get the delici look fruit salad too but it was 775 doubl eep not a budgetfriend coffe shop

th croissant was ill admit a fair good imit of european croissant howev it too was pricey and not as delici as i felt it could have been i love macaron and i do mean love but they were also pretti meh i want a combin of crispi and chewi in my macaron not just chewi 

it get major browni point for the outlet decor and cool locat it on the other side of the world for me so im not sure id make a special trip id be will to give it sandwich a tri and just stick with regular espressosip savor overcharge

let me back up here overal i realli like this place im realli a fan of the cozi sprawl and the wall are funtast to look at absolut love the map i also am a big big fan of their coffe  especi the ethiopian brew  i find this place charm and it even has some plug in station for the plug in peopl and i think it fun to watch the coffe be prep right in front of you

on the other hand while your snake your way through the line and final arriv at the pastri all of which look delight sin you get to the counter and had better check to make sure you get what you order we order the small cup and they must have thought us in need of the larger pour becaus the larg is what we got

and they must be test the newb by fill the coffe to the brim where nari a grain of sugar wouldnt caus a spillov and let you walk the slow spilli sloppi crawl back to your seat hope you dont dump said cup on some poor unwit soul in your general path i say hah hah becaus they have to clean it up and i dont feel bad at all about it

so when you go and im sure you will at least onc have them fill onli to the point that milk and sugar can be comfort ad and check your tab i didnt and they zing me dont let it happen to you

sip savor check your billi find out that sambalatt use colorado river coffe roaster which is a local coffe compani and one with qualiti bean that i can drink i have the weirdest thing with coffe  some make me veri sick when theyr high acid and high caffein and it seem i cant drink it with dairi sad i realli enjoy fine coffe but it a rare indulg 

the decor insid is nice and there is free wifi with lot of plug in which is also kinda the problem it busi and hard to find seat and most peopl do work will be there forev and some peopl gave no fuck it was busi and hung out chat well after their drink were done we luck out upstair and found some stools

th bf got a white latt with half caffein and this was a solid latt definit well made i got the nutella latt and while it was a good cup i didnt detect ani nutella flavor in it at all was it forgotten perhap 

it a solid beverag but im not sure if i quit like stay here i want to drink my latt and get the fuck out there just someth in the vibe the busi buzz of this place that doesnt make it quit relax this is antithet to what i believ a good cafe should be it mean they are success and the coffe is good if theyr busi but i think ill enjoy it togo next time picki mayb but like i said i rare get to drink coffe so it should be a overal experi to realli get mei had a midday flight to catch earlier and didnt leav myself much time to eat lunch befor hand  so as i was walk to my gate i stop by sever food place to see what the offer were  instead of make a lunch of cinnabon frozen yogurt or trail mix i went to quizno  the line wasnt bad but the staff there was extrem fluster  

the guy that help me ask me sever time what i want and he clarifi that they were out of romain lettuc for the salad a few time  i was fine with that i actual like the shred lettuc altern it easier to eat

befor it was my turn at the cash regist i notic that the fluster employe admit to put the wrong chees on anoth woman salad and he had a connipt befor throw that one out and make a new one for her he also forgot to prepar anoth custom soup  i thought this might just put him over the top but he hung in there at least to see me through the line

th salad itself was edibl but not great fluster guy did add oliv pepperocini tomato guacamol and egg per my request  this was a good thing becaus the chicken in the salad was nasti it tast extrem process and so did the guac although i ate that anyway  i pick around chicken and use the honey mustard dress for flavor  the pitalavosh that came with it wasnt bad  not the healthiest lunch but it couldv been much worse

so there you have it quizno at the airport is pretti averag if i return ill like tri just a veggi sandwich or mayb give their turkey a shot  but in the meantim i hope that quizno hire anoth employe or two  perhap someon whos more calm and can help the fluster guy who serv me todaywent here for lunch with a friend  i order the nacho with no meat  it was a pretti larg serv and came top with chees bean sour cream guacamol salsa rice

i was surpris that they put rice on their nacho  ive never eaten nacho with rice befor  it was not too bad  i thought the rice was bland and didnt add to the flavor but it gave an interest textur to it  i request the spiciest salsa they had but it wasnt that spici at alli guess they make it for most gringo  i thought the pinto bean were ok but could have use a littl more flavor  the chip were not home made but were of good qualiti  overal not bad

mi friend had a barbacoa pork burritoth portion was huge  he like it alot

on cool thing they had was a larg select of hot sauc  i tri a few of the realli spici one and they pack some punch  im curious about their burrito  taco and will tri them if i eat there again

wil i return  at some point probablybut it not my 1st or 2nd choicokay so i slowli and cautious came back to this spot it a good quick option by the hous and good when they keep it fresh i just wont come dure a slack time right befor close again i dont think it was food poison but definit someth was off and upset my stomach enough to reject it the past few time ive been absolut fine 

i appreci they do brown rice now i prefer that in my bowl actual i normal get steak or carnita but have been get the chicken as a better option

keep in mind that while they tout healthi there is still a rather crazi amount of sodium in their food for a fresh concept so if you are watch what you eat you should probabl look onlin at their nutrit information

chipotl is one of those chain that i would begrudg say is rather good and is kinda a genius concept for fast foodif your a big fan of frost good caus that the onli good thing on the cupcak here 
ok ok ill give them a break sinc i did come here around close time so i realli cant expect ani fresh tast cupcak i had the birthday surpris cupcak which besid the slight dryness it had there wasnt realli ani flavor to it just vanilla and buttercrem most birthday label cakescupcak have a punch of bitterweet to them that realli give them the tast that say birthday flavor rather than just vanilla i also had a bite of the wed cake flavor cupcak as well it tast exact the same um ok
could probabl get better flavor varieti at wal mart

anyway i ate all the frost off and threw the cake in the trash i might tri this place anoth time perhap in the morn when they have their more distiguish flavor avail bad last minut call on my parti came to pyaar in a roundabout way you see i ask the hotel desk clerk if he had a menu for the thai restaur around the corner archi  he said he did but they had chang the name to someth els he fuss around in a drawer not in his drawer that would be weird said here it is and hand me a menu for pyaar

i knew right away that indian cuisin is not thai cuisin  im funni that way  while i have enjoy be curri away at both the food is distinct differ  anyon that is even a slight foodi is not go to confus thai food with indian food

so i decid to check them both out and i decid on indian instead of thai

i was the onli one in the restaur i tri order sever thing and struck out with an assort of were out of that and he onli make that dure the day hintdont put it on the dinner menu

i opt to order sever small thing i start with a veggi samosa follow with some gobi paratha and to gorasmalai

i realli like the samosa  the gobi paratha was pretti good with a nice robust and graini bread

th rasmalai for dessert wasinterest  veri sweet

overal pretti solid indian nice peopl and reason prices

and sanford and son on the tube when i left

it special in banh mi the vietnames sandwich with the french heritag and bun they have about 30 differ varieti and they all cost 324 

they also have the drink popular in taiwan and now ubiquit in asian establish milk tea and boba slushi with boba tapioca ball too they are also 324 

there are a hand of tabl some candi machin and a few odd and end varieti store item to increas the store total revenu potenti 

the sandwich are ok pretti decent size not the best banh mi but it is hard to beat their pricetast ratioi stumbl onto this small vietnames sandwich joint after get lost in las vega chinatown  well it not realli much of a chinatown  more like a string of asian mini mall along spring mountain rd

i pick the grill pork and thai ice tea with boba  the sandwich was larg with lot of fill insid  the best part for me was the crispi delic bread  not too chewi and easi to chomp on  the fill seem homemad rather than a larg vietnames sandwich chain  the sausag slice was thick and compliment the perfect grill pork inside

if i ever get lost in chinatown ever again i know where to get my grub on  3 outta 5 star from me  they make a good solid sandwichdefinit not what i was expect in everi way possibl usual i dont like bar but my friend cousin band otherwis was play that night so she invit me and my friend to come down to watch them perform the band itself was good but im suppos to be review the black door right 

the black door is not your typic bar sure there is a bar in the back complet with drink and bar food but everyth els about this place isnt like ani of the dive bar ive been to first off dont judg a book by it cover while the outsid of the black door is noth special i was surpris at how nice it was insid comfi loung chair vip tabl mini chandeli mirrorsi was confusedi this a bar or nightclub minus rude bouncer and a dress code while the interior was nice i didnt appreci some of the video that were play on the flat screen i think i saw more bodi part than i want toit was not nice and i wish i could have chang the channel or someth so for those who are a littl on the conserv side dont watch the video anyway i didnt drink or eat anyth so i cant comment about the price 

will i be come back here again probabl not unless my friend realli want to go 

ps when the park lot is pack dont pay for valet park at the lot behind the build also behind the bob marley wall pictur is where they stash their alcohol suppli right next to the stagejust an interest tidbit i thought some peopl would find amusi talk my gracious date in to take me somewher new for dinner on friday night he want dick but i can be pretti convinc when food is involv i head read a lot about centurion on yelp so i persuad him this was the spot to tri 

i was pleas to see we were the onli peopl when we arriv i alway like the special attent and choic of seat we chose a spot outsid on the patio to take advantag of the beauti even and got busi with our orders

w start with the bake clam in a berri balsam reduct and pancetta cream sauc it was light and scrumptious we also share the three entré dinner for two  12 rack lamb  12 filet mignon and  12 poach tilapia they were all excel the filet had a smoki wood fire sear and the lamb was incred moist 

the entré came with three risotto a white truffl a chorizo and manchego and a spici coconut shrimp the flavor were great howev the risotto were extrem overdon had i cook those at home i would have pitch them out befor serv them to my guest to the chef eric credit he did offer to have us back and to tri the risotto on him as he claim that is not the norm 

i will be back the place is charm and the overal vibe veri invit no one is perfect risotto but the heart and effort put in to the dish is worth a second chancthe skinni realli great lunchhappi hour special with a decent sukiyaki sauc 3 servic  okay but the set up a littl awkward caus you cant control the heat sourc 3 valu  for 1095  a good serv of rice veggi and kobe chuck this place is a pretti good deal 3

after see the sign for shabu shabu i enthusiast head in for their reason price lunch special the cost of the lunch special sukiyaki onli was between 995 for prime or 1095 for kobe chuck opt for the kobe chuck we settl in for our littl afternoon treat

initi the sukiyaki sauc seem a littl on the thin and salti side but as the liquid kept get ad the sauc becam more sweet there wasnt enough negi green onion to have that subtl flavour in the broth becaus of this i would say the broth would be onli okay

th qualiti of the ingredi was good although between the two plate i got more japanes mushroom than the hubbi did serv size for both the veget and meat were veri reason for the price i wish they did have a littl more tofu but that my person taste

mi onli complaint is the set up i just wish we could adjust our own cook pot temperatur i felt bad have the server constant turn up and down our littl hot pot luckili the place wasnt busi but still that could be a problem if it was our drink were constant refil promptly

overal it not the best sukiyaki ive ever had but it not the worst ive had either our meal was veri satisfi and affordall i want was some realsushi
i had no idea i was walk into a cook school 
a friend and i  walk into this place and we were greet right away  as soon as we sat i notic that  this was go to be a differ experi for us there was a burner in front of everi seat area and onli one waitress and no cook in the dine area we order the all you can eat special and a coupl of beer and so the lesson began
 here the thingim not so sure what we order also im not use to this kind of cuisin but when the waitress came back after take our order or shop list she came back with some raw item sat them on the counter and turn on the burner and gave us some quick cook instructionso0i look at my friend who was also look at me with the same look as mani yelper with the orang head and a big question mark across their face all i said wasyou do the cook i do the dishes
 we start to get the hang of thing also peopl start to seat around us profession and we could now imit what everyon els was doing
at the end the food was ok as much as i hate to say that sinc this time the cook wasm so i kinda fire myself and went for the sushi roll for the rest of the meal
th swish roll the volcano roll and the spider rolli know might as well throw in the california roll but i didnt see anyth more closer to real sushi
th place is veri clean and function for what they do price are competit the servic is great although it couldv been fabul had we had our own person cook but now i know what to expect next time overal it was a good experi and the food was decent i may come back and tri other item from the menu unlessim closer to the 99 ranch supermarketyeah babybump up to a 3 star rate now

i was just not satisfi with my 2 star rate that i had to issu in my first review

i want to give lee sandwich one more shot befor i cross them off my list forever

thi visit was a lot better and i am pleas for that i order the same a bbq pork bahn mi and ask that they put extra sauc sinc last time the sandwich was a bit dri the sauc they put in the sandwich is a yummi sweet special mayo veri flavor inde this time the sandwich had more fill in it like it should more bbq pork and pickl veggi which was realli good

i also order a passion fruit italian soda with the chewi gel cherri and fruit bit at the bottom as well as two chicken egg roll which were delicious

although i order the same bbq pork sandwich as last time it was much better today lee seem to lack consist which is import not good when the way your sandwich tast or is made depend on who make it realli do not like to have to make a 5050 bet or roll the dice on whether or not it will be hit or miss not a good factor

i will return and hope my order will come out and tast the same as today did rather than on my first disappoint visit

th onli thing that could have been better was the wait for my order there were onli a coupl of peopl in front of me and i wait for awhil in line and onc i place my order servic could be faster that is for sure there clear is no urgenc to get the order outwhenev i go here my usual is the 4 grill chicken for those that are noob it like pho but in a french baguett without the broth i referenc bruce lee becaus they also put fresh slice jalapeno in it so if you arent expect it watch out give you a realli good kick to your tast bud 

if you are not sure what to get just get whatev everi bodi get by default when they go here for the first time the 1 combin it has a lttle bit of everyth in it well not everyth but if you wanna play it safe this and the grill chicken are safe picks

for those that dont find the baguett sandwich appeal they have huge croissant sandwich yes they have european sandwich not sure whi they would have these becaus they are a vietnames sandwich place but it is good now these sandwich are much more toler if you dont wanna get surpris with what is in them you have choic like roast beef turkey and ham just to name a few im not gonna go over everi littl thing they serv cuz otherwis you will be fall asleep 

they also have nice appet like hot wing and spring roll along with a whole list of differ flavor smoothi dont forget to throw some boba in there oh also did i mention they have frozen yougurt as well

last but not least a lot of peopl also get the ice coffe here i have tri it myself and i gotta say it doe have a lot of flavor plus the caffein you crave price for the coffe are a littl bit less than starbuck which is a good thing

nic random info it nice that they are open 24 hour so if you got the munchi at 3 in the morn you are set free wifi you just need to ask i think last time it was their busi phone number last but not least if you are there long enough you can learn the number 1 to 99 in vietnamese

bad random info just recent they start take plastic but there is a minimm of a 20 dollar purchas they should of just kept the cash onli polici becaus if you dont have ani cash than you have one of two choic 1 purchas more food than you plan 2 get money from their atm which lead to more fee not onli from the machin but from your financi institut as well

so everi now and then a trip to lee should be ok henc the 3 star for more info on the rest of their menu go to their websit wwwleessandwichescomhahaha can one write a review on a place they were at but quit drunk at the same time yup i was that girl  pass out in one of the booth while her friend are ordering

i rememb that there were crumb on the tabl the seat area and the place wasnt too clean  but it was open until the wee hour of the night perfect for the after hour munchi 

they have great ice coffe so make sure you grab some

im glad they pick me up a sandwich  it was great the next morn but what can i say there noth that total stand out with this place so aok 

lee is locat on spring mountain rd  the chinatown asian area of vega there plenti of park no valet need cheapi food open til the wee hourbefor i get flame on give this place onli two start let me explain whi to me it deserv three stars

i was a us marin station oversea on mainland japan for three year dure those three year ive had the opportun to eat sushi ramen bento bowl curri udon miso soup and other food of japanes origin they way they make it and the way they eat it

th ramen that is offer here is a step abov instant ramen but is far from authent 

the broth are notic lighter and less flavor from authent the noodl are in the middl theyr close but dont have the right textur side such as meat are too fatti but season better then authent ramen

th biggest differ is the price here a bowl of ramen run from 625 to 7someth which isnt bad but it the side that get you back 150 for a hard boil egg 150 for a spoon full of pickl mustard green 250 for extra noodles

back in downtown iwakuni a bowl of ramen a side of goyza and a plate of kimchi fri rice was onli about 700ish yen back in 2006ish who would have figur five year later id pay doubl the cash to have a sixteenth a mealok gave this place anoth tri and i still have to say im not a devote 

i did enjoy the ramen quit a bit i daresay a littl more than on my first visit i got the tonkatsu and this time i avoid the mustard green hope to reduc the salti tast pretti good but the broth is still a littl too salti for me my fella love it and hed probabl give it a higher rate so mayb it just me

itl still be my goto place for ramen in town thoughi gotta agre 100 with respect yelper tien ns review he was the onli guy brave enough to leav a low rate for monta person i think that most peopl are ride the bandwagon and just rate this place up becaus everyon els is i came again today and just couldnt enjoy the ramen here like i use to 

like most of my yelp friend alreadi know i am somewhat an expert at ramen dure my colleg year my friend takeichi and i went on a bizarr and pointless quest across the west coast in order to eat miso ramen at everi singl famous ramen hous in america 30 day and over 50 ramen hous later we declar ourselv ramen masters

ramen has a lot of histor and cultur signific to the japanes peopl after the defeat of the imperi forc in ww2 japan had practic becom a poverti stricken 3rd world countri it was around then that ramen becam extrem popular due to how cheap the ingredi were there was one ramen hous in san diego which i visit year ago that had the exact variat of post ww2 ramen the ramen itself was practic a less salti version of shio it had absolut noth in it besid for noodl and salt water that mean you get no charsiu egg or veget person i thought it was the worst bowl of ramen i have ever had the owner of the ramen hous told me that the onli reason she serv this depress version of ramen is becaus of it cultur signific at least monta doesnt have anyth that bad    

i guess the reason i origin like monta was becaus i was so use to eat the extrem spici style of ramen from california so when i first had monta miso ramen it was so differ that i actual thought it was good i cant identifi which region variat of ramen is serv at monta me and takeichi think that it might be a specif shibuya variat but we just cant come to a posit conclus but we do believ though that it definit is some kind of tokyo variation

i myself have begun to believ that the miso ramen at monta is actual a combin of toyko style and a random american style in the 1960s ichiro mashita creat the california roll becaus american kept complain to him that his roll that had otoro in it tast like garbag  i kind of think that monta recip is the california roll of the ramen world and that whi it rare to find a fullblood japanes person eat here

weird observationth tonkatsu and the miso ramen here at monta tast almost ident this is veri unusu those two should never tast that  similar

on of my friend who is fullblood korean alway refus to come here with us when i ask him whi he said it was becaus korean believ that ramen is the food of the rat i dont know what that suppos to mean

it is just so difficult to move around here the seat are design for peopl who are less than 55 and weight around 120lbs the stool at the bar area are veri uncomfort walk to the bathroom is difficult becaus you keep have to bump into other custom and the girl at the cash regist it common for ramen hous to be small even the most popular ramen hous in americaorochon onli seat like 20 peopl and the chair are veri uncomfort but somehow monta is far wors 

like 90 of the custom here are yelper everi time i come here i recogn someon from their yelp pictur 

when i was here today i overheard a person talk about how monta is the greatest and anim ramen is fake ramen to me anim ramen is far better than monta anim actual give you gigant portion of bamboo mushroom corn egg and charsiu for free while monta charg extra and onli give about 1 tbsp of micros dice bamboo today i order extra butter and i got a teaspoon at sora or anim they would have load my bowl with butter also at sora and anim the bowl are at least 30 larger  but the best thing about anim is that they give you 3 slice of narutomaki for free  also the guy who run anim ramen is a guy name ryosuk and his dad is one of the most  famous tradit japanes sushi chef in america so i dont understand where this nonjapanes rumor is come from   

i still believ that monta has the best shoyu ramen but out of the 3 major ramen hous in lvmontaanimesora i gotta say that monta has the worst miso ramen mayb the reason whi monta has bad miso ramen is becaus it is a toyko style ramen hous and toyko style ramen hous alway special in shoyu while it is the sapporo style ramen hous that alway specif special in miso ramenmiso ramen was invent in the citi of sapporo  but i still love the excel custom servic here so ill give monta 3star3 12 star came in for lunch dure the week i sat at the counter due to the full hous and went with the tonkotsu shoyu ramen with egg and extra chashu

sit at the counter i was abl to watch them prepar the ramen and notic there was a chef in train when i receiv my bowl all look decent and tast good with the except that the ramen was overcook and soggi the patron next to me receiv his bowl and he order doubl meat and they onli give him a singl serv also which wasnt cool either 

servic was decent but let get it togeth in the kitchenafter have ramen from the restaur down the road  i was quit disappoint in mont ramen  

it was relat easi to findon the right side of spring mountain road as you drive east the park lot is share with other busi restaur  i could feel a slight breez from the air condit which was realli help sinc it was 100 degre outsid 

the interior was small and dark there were 5 tabl and 9 counter seat there were a few chair for custom to wait for a tabl make sure you get your name on the clipboard 

the gyoza was shock it look pale and undercook  like it was just fri on one of it 3 side  the insid was bland and flat tast 

on the other hand  the miso broth was realli salti and the noodl were too soft i didnt finish it  the top of green onion bamboo shoot  black fungus were room temperatur as if they were hastili thrown on the top 

i would onli go back if the competit down the road was full and if there was no line  if there was a line  go to the other restaur right next door  sorriwant to tri someth new we opt for lunch here  judg by the review im not sure if they were have an off day or whether what we order was realli a good represent of peruvian food

w order fri yuca and the server said it would be about 15 minut  20 minut later he came back and said anoth 15 minut  we never did see it  im not sure if this dish requir some prepar that had not been done sinc we were in earli but i was disappoint to not be abl to tri it

i had the lomo saltado with chicken  the chicken was pretti dri and the secret sauc was such a secret it was almost hidden from my plate  i realli onli tast soy sauc  the peruvian style fri were underneath the chicken  im not sure how they differ from regular fri though  my husband had the corderito chiclayano lamb shank  it had a ton of flavor but again the meat was tough

th chef perhap owner too did come out and apolog for the yuca and was veri sweet howev  i may give it anoth shotdid you know that there was a song call peruvian cocain  total unrel and definit show off the librari of useless fact i keep in my head  

definit unrel to the fact that this littl eateri locat in the strip mall on the corner of rural and mckellip in temp is a decent place off the old town beaten path  

this establish is one of those lucki gem you drivebi everyday and never notic until one day your look for someth differ but close by

i order the chupe de camaron shrimp soup   the soup was veri delici and i enjoy it  this soup did not tast as if the shrimp overpow the flavor of the soup  i could still enjoy the corn and potato in the soup  they make the soup to order  the chef accident crash my first bowl of soup so they had to make a new one for me  the soup come in a fair larg serv bowl  i could not eat a quarter of that  they wrap it up for me and the leftov fed me for 2 more meals

i was disappoint that the peruvian fri were just plain frozen steak fri fri in hot greas or what i normal know as french fri  i order the peruvian fri expect someth differ they got me on that one

i went here with about 5 or 6 other friend who also enjoy their meal  i ask everyon if they would return and the major said yes they would come back  i know i will one day  i look forward to tri out their pollo saltadoyummi yummi asian food is now sit in my tummi tummi  i thought for sure id get the ftr on this one but adam and norman beat me to the punch im alway excit to see new restaur open up in my hood especi ethnic restaur  so after dinner at noodl ranch last week i pick up a menu from this place

and when my hunger struck this even i decid to call in and place an order for take out  good thing i decid to take out instead of eat in becaus this restaur has no ambianc at all  it was empti on a saturday night and remind me of the fast food chines place you see at food court in mall  the peopl work there were not veri welcom either and when i suggest they add an eggplant dish to the menu they basic just said no without even entertain the idea

when i came home with my bag i notic that they didnt includ chopstick utensil napkin soy sauc or fortun cooki  what chines restaur have you ever been to that didnt have fortun cooki  

anyway i order the mu shu veget and the mix veget with shrimp in the health food section of the menu  i probabl would not describ either dish as yummi yummi but they were satisfactori the portion were larg and the veget were fresh but the garlic sauc that came with the shrimp dish was pretti nasti  

i would possibl give this place anoth chanc in the futur for takeout in a pinch but id high recommend hit up noodl ranch totti or lao thai if your want yummi yummi asian food insteadunfortun it time onc again to drop my rate of what use to be one of my favourit restaur if this happen at ani other place id give it a 1 star and perman avoid on principl but becaus poaf have pretti much the best barbecu ive ever tast itll get a flat 3 accompani by a giant frown of annoyance

so what happen did the price increas like they did at love hut no food qualiti drop no still cramp as a sardin tin insid with less than a snowbal chanc in hell of get a seat at lunchtim well yes but that isnt the reason this time it due to fals advertis sever week ago they came up with the idea of a loyalti card buy 5 meal the sixth is free here my photo of it httpwwwyelpcombizphotos825ncscqg6hsul5gm2caselectssvkmjtwyvgp3punafybsa seem pretti obvious how it work right well last time i was there i reach the free meal marker i usual get their smokin meal menu item  two type of meat plus two side and half a sausag howev when i tri to claim the free meal the counter girl inform me that they dont give that particular meal out as free becaus quot unquot there so much meat in it which equat to about two fist of meat half a sausag like i said plus mayb eight ounc in can bake bean and sweet potato fri she then tell me that i can get ani of the other item on the menu for free or els she could give me a free drink or say three dollar discount the card didnt say exclud smokin meal they brought me there six time and told me the card was frickin next to worthless get anoth menu item for 7 for free or get 3 off my smokin meal which is onli a coupl of buck more than the item they classifi as free wow

id have been happi to show up here forev and pay their ask price for a meal but the fact that they push off a loyalti card on me then told me to gfi when i tri to claim on it is rank as hell fail lose two star seacrest out oh seacrest back in for anoth ten second went there today bought the usual girl didnt offer me anoth card or mention the concept at all left still delici still piss at them seacrest out againi have been torn about tri smashburg sinc some of the review for their locat have been less than smash  last night we decid to tri someth differ and decid to tri smashburger

i look at the onlin menu and then went to this locat which is near where i live  i got the avocado club hamburg for myself and the truffl mushroom burger for my wife  after find out what smash fri were i got an order for each of us

sarah was the woman run the regist last night and she was good answer my question  im sure she could tell it was my first time there  she told me to have a seat and shed bring the to go order as soon as it was readi  in about 5 minut the order was readi  sinc there was no one els in the restaur i knew it was mine

a short drive home and we were enjoy the hamburg  they were good for a chang  they are somewher in the middl between normal fast food hamburg chain and the upscal hamburg shop which have sprung up around las vega  the fri were good

im not go to make smashburg a regular on my rotat schedul but it was good enough that ill be back sometim  i need to tri the nutter butter shakenote to self next time i go to a place call a sandwich shop mayb i should order a sandwich

actu my nake chop aka a chop salad with turkey green carrot tomato onion and avocado want bad it didnt blow me away either  and it took awhil to make  

i was with misti y and we came here straight from the airport  i mustv work up quit an appetit fli in from la becaus i was pretti hungri when we arriv but i felt like a salad so that what i order  it just wasnt the most fill salad around  henc my note to self above

id give this place anoth shot and i suggest you do if your in the hood but take my advic  order a sandwich not a saladthis haagen daz locat in the venetian the canal shopp specif is not uniqu to the area obvious but their milkshak are thick creami and good servic is friend here too price though are incred high 8 for a milkshak but the high price might be expect given that this ice cream shop is in vega and most food is overpr here

th venetian offer complimentari self and valet park like all the other major hotel and casino on the stripi origin plan to check out anoth thai place further down on desert inn but end up here instead 

stick e rice is locat in a strip mall so there plenti of park they have menus outsid the door so you can check out their offer without even step in but onc you step insid youll find a contemporari design place with the obligatori pictur of the thai king on the wall it has a relat nice ambianc to it 

servic was prompt and my egg flower soup appet arriv fast i snap a pictur of it as i was impress by how they present it and it tast as good as it look their thai ice tea was pretti much the same as what ive found from here to la it was good enough though that i finish it 

to give them a fair comparison i order mint chicken or chili mint chicken and to be honest i wasnt all that impress the rice had a littl bit more flavor to it but komol offer is just a littl bit better and a bit more spici i ask for medium heat and was not impress with the heat in the dish 

overal while i like this place it not a good valu for the money i can spend almost 150 less at komol for the total bill and get an egg roll and ginger salad that stick e rice doesnt offer 

overal as ive had a lot of komol late stick e rice was a nice break but it was more expens for what i order and i got less ill file them away as a lunch choic and to make a second visit but i dont see them make it onto my regular lunch rotati went to kgb for a realli late night snack at around 230am  it was actual a tough decis for me to eat here consid that at this point of my trip i alreadi had eaten burger at other spot on the strip and didnt realli feel like have anoth one  i look at their menu and did see someth that caught my attent their bacon waffl and fri chicken burger  what the heck

iv had my fair share of chicken and waffl from rosco to farmerbrown and hash hous a go go and even bouchon but ive never had them in the form of a sandwich  so when they brought it to my tabl i couldnt help but crack up becaus it just look ridicul httpwwwyelpcombizphotoslosgyd9dhosjjm7qcly5qwselectuznwqtkgyxi3oebfgbxjw  basic you get two bacon waffl slider with fri chicken that come with a funnel of tater tot and your choic of either mapl or jalapeno syrup  i opt for mapl becaus i thought that jalapeno syrup just sound so weird  mayb i shouldv opt for it though sinc the dish was strang enough alreadi  

i realli didnt know how to eat this thing becaus onc i put the syrup on the waffl i was no longer abl to eat it with my hand  i end up take it all apart and just knife and fork it  i think the execut fell a littl flat sinc the bacon waffl were a littl overdon and the chicken was dri  the syrup onli help just a littl bit to counter the dryness  i do applaud kerri simon for tri to be creativ with this dish though  at least the tator tot were good 

i guess it not realli fair to judg this spot base on their interest take on chicken and waffl sinc it a burger joint after all  i do appreci that theyr open realli late till 6am  ill probabl drop by again so i can tri their burger or kerri simon famous iron chef slider and hope have a better experii dont know whi in the movi all the femal kgb agent either have big boob and small waist or are otherwis built like male heavyweight bodybuild  is it a good cop bad cop thing  i dont know

i do know that jennif my server is built closer to the first descript and was pretti attent as well without be over suffoc  she gave me help suggest about what to order put the order in deliv it and leav me alon to enjoy my food  

besid that i also know that order the doubl cheeseburg was a great idea and veri satisfi as far as burger go in las vega  i order mine doubl cheeseburg cook medium rare and the kitchen staff prepar it nice  even the side of fri that came with the order was tasti  i unfortun also learn that kerri special slider are the worst slider i have ever had in las vega  food truck serv better slider than the uncreat slider you can but should definit not order here  the captain crunch shake was decent but i felt that it would be better if the cereal is blend into finer bit in my shake

recap

doubl cheeseburg  if you are hungri get this  the fri are good but pay 2 or 50 of what these fri or onion ring cost to substitut it is pretti lame  but you might as well goug the tourist and local that end up have a meal here while you have the opportunity

slid  the first one i tri tast like the meat was go bad  the after tast in my mouth was day and night differ compar to the all beef patti in my 2x cheeseburg  plus with just a small piec of chees and small slice of tomato in each slider i am think i would probabl enjoy a cheeseburg from burger king more

captain crunch shake  just vanilla ice cream blend with milk and the yellow captain crunch  not bad but i will save the 6 and get someth els to satisfi my sweet tooth in the future

also be sure to stop by and get yourself a total reward card if you plan to dine here or the other caesar properti  those 1 save on each menu item here can rack up quick to offset the tax owe on your dine excursion

3 star  would be higher obvious had i not been hungri enough to order them lousi slider after happili polish off the fantast doubl cheeseburgi like the concept of kgb and it riff on the soviet era  be at kgb howev is not like be at the lubyanka in moscow  there are soviet era knock off poster of the proletariat  most of the femal server had short leather short that evok a polic state couture

i had a groupon that was about to expir so i messag a good yelp buddi and ask if he want to join me here befor our yelp event last night and use the groupon  he has been there befor but this was my first visit

i order their southwest burger which the menu describ like this   avocado cilantro limemarin pepper and onion pico de gallo pepper jack chees avocado crème fraîch jalapeñocheddar bun  i order it rare  the burger come with fri  the burger was cook perfect and it was veri juici but none of the avocado was there  pico yes and chees but there was no tast of avocado  

servic was good dure our visit  sinc the place was almost empti it should have been  the price was in line with strip price  at first i thought the burger was overpr but when you factor in the fri serv with each sandwich it is compar to other burger joint on the strip

i went to see the round semipriv dine area on the side of the kitchen where they have the hammer and sickl light  i got a photo of it and i could almost see felix dzerzhinski have dinner there  kgb is aokfuk dat  unfortun for right now im go with a nonono naga finger wag on the naga dog until the fuku crew stop over cook the link on the flat top  all the top work veri well especi the daikon relish  but this sad look hot link forgot to appli it sunscreen and has got major sunburn everywher and is peel  yike  

on a posit note the miso glazey butaburg with an over easi fri egg which i request sinc it usual fri over medium aka the hakujin is a perfect combin that work realli well  if your eat this stand up get in the patent philli hunch or you could get fukd  your stain free fresh kick and design jean will thank ya later  my suggest is to order your burger medium or you could get fukd with a well doner

i can mos definit appreci the qualiti of the ingredi that are use but the execut of overcook need some improv to be a consist product  
2 star for the burnt naga dog
4 star for the tasti hakujin burger

next on my todo list is the chicken katsu burger  sound so plain janedoesnt it need a new name or whatoh fuku burger what a color and moodi charact you seem to be

aft a night of shenanigan the boy want a treat have spot the illus fukutruck on our way elsewher we hope theyd still be there when we were done around 2 am they were and had a big crowd of costum fan gather around descend upon the bank of america park lot you can hear their music blast we arriv to a song about cap peopl and a chorus of gunshot and the nword kind of awkward but whatev it seem there a lot of repeat custom or fan that hang around the truck as there were peopl park and hang out by or in their car for the entir durat we were there 

there was no sens of organ in the line just a clusterfk of peopl mob around the lone girl take order we had sever peopl attempt to get in front of us and other ask us where the line end some peopl stood on the peripheri of the cluster and wait for 10 minut in the cold in skimpi costum befor get frustrat and leav without anything

th music was also so loud that it made order a challeng unless you got in the poor girl face or yell at her she took our name and put our order in when done a guy would scream out your name  from the window vain compet with the music we watch him call for 45 peopl with visibl grow aggriv 

the menu itself was pretti simpl though i know you can custom with egg or extra patti we opt for the karai or spici burger and an order of their garlic fri we ate the fri on the drive home and had the burger onc there the fri seem like they were from a box then heavili dose with their garlic salt i like the sauc that came with them but j thought they were too salti the fri had decent crunch and heft they werent potato needl or massiv steak fries

onc we got to the burger we were disappoint the burger had flavor but was burnt on the outsid and ultrarar on the insid top with a spici mayo anoth sauc cucumb avocado cream and a coupl of other top it had an interest combo of textur and flavor to compliment the meati but not enough to save it from be mediocr the burger may have been more redeem if the experienceatmospher of order it hadnt put us off 

the area around the truck was trash with half eaten food and debri everywher sticker and photo cover much of the window and the onli insight we had into the kitchen was the irrit guy stick his head out and yell at a mutha fugato get back in the truck 

this is realli an instanc where the busi philosophi shine at the forefront compar these fellow to the slider truck the boy there sing while cook happili greet their custom with enthusiasm  a fist bump maintain a clean exterior and fair consist food prepar ive had a mediocr slider and forgiven them becaus they were so pleasant to deal with the food here has the potenti for awesom but i just dont want to deal with a disord mob to get a burger 

edit bump a star for owner respons  it alway nice to see a busi take the time to respond to critic direct like thatsolid 35 star  

we hadnt dine at a firefli in at least a coupl of year so what the heck  i actual prefer the atmospher of this one over paradis  high ceil less cramp and more park space  

the menu hasnt chang much from what i rememb but i did notic a coupl of thing like the lobster corn dog and lobster escargot style so we got those at 10 a plate  the corn dog were the onli disappoint dish of the night  the bread was not good and it was kinda soggi  the escargot lobster was tasti  i suppos anyth cook escargot style would be  

asid from the usual like bacon wrap date empanada pork is better than the vegetarian and slider we went with our waiter one suggest of the warm spinach salad  glad we did that  who knew warm wilt spinach with pine nut roast pepper and artichok would be so good  i think whatev dress they had go on knock it out of the park  the sangria pack a nice punch as well  i would be fine come back to this locati love good food i love italian food valvona  crolla is the epic italian deli of edinburgh have been here for almost 100 year the deli up the front of their origin elm row branch is wonder like willi wonka for meat chees and pasta lover i love it

th caff bar up the back sell all their delici food stuff which is good so whi the three stars

th boy and i came here for breakfast a £30 breakfast is transpir yes we werent count as we order but we normal order the same thing where ever we go and it usual rang from £10  £20 the usual be normal two type of cook poach egg and bacon or smoke salmon a tea and coffe and two oj the onli differ here was the boy also order one of their fresh chocol croissant for after they are that good

so either the chocol croissant was £10 good or their price are just general higher i cant actual rememb the individu price but pay £30 for two for breakfast is a wee bit much the food realli is great and they are an edinburgh institut so i think the price reflect this but when i can get equal good cook breakfast elsewher at half the pricewel you do the maths

th other thing that i dont know if they could chang is the space itself it onli has sky light so whilst there light there no view the decor is quit date and the chair and tabl are spread out across a rectanguar floor in a veri order order ehh you know what i mean it just feel a littl soulless this is a total contrast to the dark highceiling meatstrewn deli up front it just isnt somewher id want to go for long leisur brunch or lunch which is a real shame

dont get me wrong i love their deli i like their other café despit that theyr also realli pricey and i love their food but the price are just too high and there are other place nearbi with much more personbueno burger is do some great advertis late take full advantag of valpack etc to get the word out about their neat concept of mesquit grill burger and dogsbut if you live anywher nearbi the scent of the burn wood alon has alreadi piqu your attention

sometim it possibl to creat expect that are tough to live up to  
the air smell great but the burger itself just didnt seem to hang onto all of the flavor generat by the smoke while grill  it wasnt anyth that was bad about it but it just wasnt as excit as i want it to be
i enjoy it enough that i know ill take advantag of a coupon and give it anoth gostop number 2 on the yelpalici day 

i just got the passionfruit ice tea i just need someth light and fresh it was less ice tea and more juic 

the first few sip were too sweet i swirl the cup and was better though good it need to be lighter on the passion fruit syrup 

on the other hand elnino love his watermelon smoothi so i might have just order the wrong thing and the wrong time 

will be back for the shave ice soon thoughi need to go back and im liabl to up my review to 4 star i mean realli chilaquil so close to home they were delici the first time but it been a coupl month  i need to get back there 

here the deal this restaur use to be on central ave just north of hatcher httpwwwazcentralcomentdiningarticles0911mexdiningcheaphtml and theyv move to the let it roll bowl alley as a consequ im guess they were ask to have bowlerfriend food like pizza hot dog and hamburg so youll find those on the menu

youl also find the tradit oaxacan food and a mini version of the minimart from the previous locatfinal tri the food and it just ok the servic was ok too 

food is cheap which is a plus not the best bar food in town but the quantiti are plenti i high recommend you share a meal with a friend theyr that enorm i order 35 shrimp with potato of your choic cole slaw and hush puppi and it was onli 1095 that was more than enough to feed two hungri people

th drink are pretti reason price as well just not a big fan of their mix drink id stick to their beer 

overal an ok experigood servic qualiti food decent price fun restaurantbar scene with pool tabl and an awesom atmospher overall

i had lunch here with one of my gal pal who actual introduc me to it and who brag about their food

sh order the philli cheesesteak sandwich and i opt for fish and chip both meal were tasti and great qualiti to say the least lot of food for a great price they have daili special as well i will be back to check out the bar and have someth on tap for my next visit this place is fun

i am on the late freight with check this restaur out howev better late than nevertoday was my first time eat at jimmi hot dog for hear such good thing  read the review i was slight disappoint i want someth quick  easi for lunch it wasnt busi  servic was fair fast i guess that the benefit of have a later lunch hour custom servic was ok i mention it was my first time in and that id heard good thing about their dog i order the fire dognot spici which was told it general serv chicago style i was ask what top i want to my misunderstand thought she meant addit to the chicago style top my dog which id order to go  to my surpris onli had what i thought were my addit top of spici mustard  good bundl of jalapeno on it it was a tasti dog  came with fabul fresh hot fri for a reason price ill definit tri it again it close and good cheap eatim alway excit to hear about a new veganfriend eateri in town so i couldnt wait to check this place out  the cafe is open and bright and they have both tabl or sofa seat avail they also have a stage so mayb they will be have live music at some point or mayb an open mic poetri night where i can read my vegan sonnet kidding

they have a standard cafe menu of soup salad and sandwich includ wrap and panini  they have a list of like 6 vegan soup  includ vegan chix noodl minestron chili lentil and butternut squash  howev onli the lentil was avail  booooo

ther is a veganvegetarian version of the standard menu that is almost exact the same  they just replac the meat andor chees with a vegan version they have tofurkey and crown meat and it look like daiya cheez  my server told me that all of the veganveggi menu is vegan or can be made as such  yay

they also have a juic bar various tea boba which is organ and not as sweet as regular boba  i overheard a discuss about this and frozen yogurt  you can dine in or do takeout

th servic was pretti quick i was seat immedi with a menu then a coupl minut later i was brought a littl dish of dri fruit to gnaw on while make my menu decis  what a cute idea

i opt for the vegan cobb salad 999 with vegan ranch dress  i will admit i was a littl underwhelm although to be fair it came exact as describ on the menu  lettuc tomato onli a few crouton bacon bit fake turkey a littl cheez and avocado  i could have use a few more veggi in there carrot cucumb  but what the hell ive never had a real cobb salad so mayb that right on the money 

regardless it was a good size veri tasti and they did not skimp on the avocado  the dress was so good  they onli gave me a littl tini cup but that realli all i need and if theyd dole out more i would have just slop on some unnecessari calori  the salad also came with some veri fluffi whole wheat pita that was delish  i just had a black ice tea to drink which was fine but noth special and 299

they have a deal go on now that you get half off your drink with the purchas of an entre  it a bit pricey but it is organ food so your get realli good qualiti  i think this place has a lot of potenti  as is id give it a 35 so we might be round this score up to 4 if my next visit and there will definit be one goe wellone of the sell point for mexican food is that it is cheap and flavor habanero was onli one of these from a place name after one of the spicier pepper one would expect more heat and flavor but both were lack 

i order a burrito and fill it with chile pork i think that what they said it was i just point rice black bean bell pepper and onion cilantro onion corn salsa pico chees and those spici onion note the onion were mild spici at best i also got some of their horchata which was a littl on the wateri side for me thing to note the rice is just plain white rice no spanish or cilantro rice here also if you are look for spice you probabl want to tri the hot or extra hot salsa the one mark as medium did not have a bite at all 

as other have said the order process is chipotl style you choos what style of plate you want  burrito taco torta quesadilla etc then you pick your meat and top the guy behind the counter were realli friend and nice and i would give the servic 5 star but the food is a 35 just aok i would be open to go back and tri someth else

habanero is locat on the end of a row of store that sell thing like floor pretti easi to miss if your not look for iti love smashburg realli i do  ive been put off go to this locat and final got around to get in there tonight unfortun i had a bad servic experi and even though i will probabl return im upset after tonight with this specif locat  here why

i got here around 530 and went with the all american burger with a haystack of onion ring  there wasnt a whole lot of peopl in the place when i got there but it soon start to fill up after i sat down and start to eat

halfway through my meal i had finish my drink and need a refil i also figur sinc the onion ring were small i would also grab a fork while i was up at the beverag station  mind you the place was full at this point 

i stood up took my purs grab my drink and walk to the beverag station  as i turn around i saw one of the bus boy clear my tabl my burger wasnt even half eaten  i start to go after him to leav my food and he did not hear me  he walk right by me with my dinner and continu on into the kitchen  i was furious  i had just paid 10 for a full meal and this kid was take it away  it was half the burger and half the fri not the whole burger

whil he walk into the kitchen i grab one of the burger girl and told her what was go on  i explain that i had gone to the drink station to get more pop and this kid took away my food and i wasnt done  she told me to hold on a second and grab the kid who appear to be in high school and told me to tell him what i had told her  i explain to him that i was not done eat and he had taken away the rest of my dinner  he apolog as did the server  i was still upset and told him i didnt want an apolog i want the the rest of my dinner

they offer to cook me up anoth burger and fri  i decid to pass as i was most full from what i had alreadi eaten  i ask them to get the manag and the kid ran in the back of the kitchen and never came back out  i want them to know what had happen so that way they would know

i left and call the store when i got home and talk to the manag i explain that i was upset as anyon would be and had want to talk to her about it in person but the kid who went to get the manag never reappear it was upset for me all the way around

th manag apolog and took my name and number   they said that if i come in i can have a gift certif for a free meal there which is what i had want in the first place

anyway even though i love the food here i dont know that i will be back to this specif locat ani time soon due to this whole thingnot so smashing

i mean it was okay but i wasnt wow  there a lot of place around that do burger fri and a drinkthi one isnt in the upper tier  anoth review here remark that in n out tast better and has a better pricei find this to be an accur assessment

not much more i can sayit was just  okay  with spot like lobbi tom and ted around smashburg cant compet  if im go to spend money on burger my wife and i dont want okay we want great  this spot isnt on the burger rotat for this reasonive been a big fan of the smashburg for a while the arizona burger with jalapeño is one of a kind for quicki burger joint like this one add on a side of smash fri and i walk away a happi carnivor near everi time

th other night i gave the arizona grill chicken a tri the meat was surpris good for grill cook through what made it remark were the spici top i dont consid myself a heat wimp but the pepper had me chug coke after each bite it wasnt the most pleasant experi but i was still satisfi with my choic 

asid one of the cashier was quit pleasant while the other guy who took or order act like it was forc labor or like he was too good for take burger order liter take a long swig of his beverag as we conclud our order 

smashburg is not the best of the best in term of burger establish but for the speed and price it doe the trickgraze is a spot i am alway return to hope it will be better than last time now dont get me wrong  i like their food i realli do their burger are tasti their fri are great and their brunch menu is realli nice as well but they just arent consist when i say that i mean 3 peopl could order the same thing and each of them would turn out differ one person would have soggi fri and an undercook burger one person could have perfect fri but an overdon burger and one person could have everyth perfect it just so random how thing will turn out 

the recip is right local sourc high qualiti ingredi a menu that is divers but simpl and decent price they just need to make sure that food is just right when it goe out

a great exampl is one time i had brunch and my toast had mold all over it super gross right well the waitress and chef agre they were veri apologet gave me new toast and cover my meal but whi the hell did i get serv moldi bread i the first place it wasnt exact hidden you know luckili the rest of my meal was veri good and i gave them anoth chanc but i know a lot of peopl who would have never gone back 

someday i hope i get to upgrad them to 4star becaus i sure do want toafter read about lcls open on yelp i convinc my cowork to stop by w me after a delici lunch at cowboy ciao the other day 

we were unenthusiast greet by the gal behind the counter as i quick note the vintag ice cream parlor decor and item for sale along the wall we proceed to check out the good ie the lace ice cream of cours and tri to chat w the worker but she wasnt veri friend after guess  ask which flavor in the tub correspond to the flavor list on the board the tub werent label i sampl the green tea matcha w liqueur they also have one wo and vanilla almond the amaretto in the vanilla almond was veri pronounc so definit tri it if your into almond liqueur as she was scoop the sampl i notic the ice cream had a veri odd crumbley textur probabl due to the alcohol content it kind of weird me out but the ice cream is actual veri creami i dont mind pay 375  tax for a full scoop but becaus the ice cream has an odd textur and it was the girl first day on the job i probabl onli got about 12 a scoop worth 

mayb ill go back onc i hearread about other peopl have better experidecent if your jones for tapa this is not a paella review yet i apolog in  advanc if this come off as one of those review that make manag and pr firm cring i know you cant do authent tapa in southbridgewaterfront and stay open but i have to rate it honest or not at all

i rememb the origin tpf on camelback i think where sportsman or tarbel is now i recal it be exot and delici with the right intim atmospher my memori could be cloud by lack of experi at the time but overal this place is a littl too big clean and corporatey to match an authent tapa experi like youd get in barcelona or basqu spain or some of the real deal place like in nyc i dont think you can be locat where they are and pull that off so it dumb down a bit for the market i think if your not on the search for a super authent intim experi small bar communal tabl etc it will fit the bill


atmosphere
big open live and tri a littl too hard imho the uniform look like halloween costum it come off a bit too kitschi staff all seem pretti friend if a littl harri the live music is a nice touch even though pretti low energi when we were there im anxious to catch some flamenco though


service
our server timo was the epitom of charm and enthusiasm big thumb up for him but time was all over the place first round of drink took  forev we saw other tabl clear look around for their server not sure if the bar is the holdup or what food took much longer than expect as well sinc we didnt order paella or anyth that was like made to order onc the food start come we got it all pretti quickly


drinks
man do not order the mojito i admit im pretti picki about them i love make them at home i want them muddl fresh and i want to tast all the ingredi they have a pitcher approach it like they have mojito on tap i ask for a fresh mojito not a whole pitcher i just want to tri their mojito and then move on to an albariño or some other wine i got the pitcher anyway and what came out was refresh alright much like ice water is refresh basic clear liquid with some rum aftertast no detect lime one sad littl shred of mint in each pour veri littl sugar the pitcher approach work well for sangria obvious but do not do this for mojito doesnt do them justic my wife red wine choic a pintoresco by the glass was veri good a friend who track us down there after a yelp checkin said the sangria was veri good so there you go


food
il point out the standouts

boquerones
fresh white anchovi in light oil delici smaller than ive had elsewher a littl more bodi to the fillet is nice but a great light dish

rabbit stew
thi one get you bang for the buck if your not avers to eat cute littl bunni rabbit lot of tender delici sweet meat in a light tomato broth with a nice acid too it bonein meat ensur lot of flavor

shrimp a la plancha or whatev they call it
headon shellon shrimp messi to eat unless you crunch the whole shell not quit crispi enough to allow for that though so most we peel them qualiti white shrimp with real shrimp flavor not the rubber you so often get with grill shrimp

oxtail stew
thi should be so up my alley classic mirepoix dark stew flavor did i detect a littl storebought demiglac starter but it could have been brais a bit longer like a coupl more hour there was still too much unrend fat and connect stuff not enough meat

basqu sausage
not memor if youv ever gotten the spanish chorizo from schreiner or latiendacom youll know what i wish it was like when we get the schreiner it never make it through the car ride home

mix of snail sausag and someth else
didnt do it for us no individu charact to each of the protein just a mashup of savori chewi bit be a pretti good starter bread dip if you were hungri but not a great dish

pan con tomat pan boli
for me this is a benchmark item this would have been better if the bread had more chewi and structur to it

and of cours they have all the standbi like potata brava fri squid etc and paella next time im tri the valenciana for sure that alon could add a star if the flavor are there but there better be smoki bonein dark meat chicken and the rice better be crispi on the bottom of the pan


so just aok for now

i could see an updat 4 star review once
 a ive further explor the menu and know what all the gem are and learn what to avoid for my taste

 b they finetun the servic and hope work on the authent the crowd that was there and the locat dont give me much hope for tune toward the more authent if anyth i fear it be dumb down even moreas an aficionado of spanish cuisin i came in hope to be at the least semiblown but result in a half satisfi appetit  the biggest draw for me was the seem endless count of tapa at least a dozen in each categori seafood meat vegetableschees  i alway get a kick from tri to visual what fun flavor can be produc from these exot ingredients

in my humbl book i tend to base my spanish experi on one dish and one dish onli and that is the glorious paella  for me this is a deal breaker  the price was fair and reason but the qualiti fell quit short the classic valencia was simpli too wateri histori tell me it should be fluffier creamier and rich in flavor on the other hand the arro negr was more pleas and entertain if you never had squid ink in the paella form it is a safe tri  the onli caveat is it temporarili leav black mark around your lip teeth and tongue

th list of tapa we tri includ 
 the best and recommended

 the spanish potato pie was not as soft and fluffi as i imagin part of it were choppi mediocr taste

 mushroom with garlic and sherri veri averag noth too special here

 rabbit stew with bread sauc for the first time tri this it was actual pretti good tast like chicken  the meat was tender with a rich flavor stew

 brais oxtail in paprika sauc pleasant pull off the bone good

 lamb chop thought it was somewhat dri thus not as juici as i had hope for  2 or 3 piec i believe

 calamari ring the batter was light and cook perfect accompani by three differ sauc that i cannot recal the name to but nonetheless tasty

 snail averag noth to spectacular

th pitcher of sangria was too small for my usual like it fill just 4 small glass and lack the wine taste

what i like the most was the atmospherel music creat a fun mood and the rich detail of the spanishesqu decor to bring everyth together

sinc i was here for my birthday they did bring out a complimentari flan that i thought tast a littl eggi the cool part was partak in a spanish tradit where the server shoot a long stream of wine into your mouth 
 
overal the experi here was just averag with mediocr flavor among the tapa with some except thus i would onli return for the squid ink paella rabbit stew and brais oxtaildure az restaur week some establish do a great job of highlight their menu and servicehey it all about repeat businessso whi wouldnt they want to impress you nonetheless there are alway a few that give off the vibe theyr just phone it inor perhap this is their vibe all the timecas in point tapa papa frita had been on my husband list to tri for year we were realli excit to eat here 

decor gorgeousth insid is dim and moodi with dark wood and tile accent the patio is veri romant under it grapelin pergola and beauti shade trees

start  watermelon ahi cevich and crabstuf piquillo pepper the watermelon was so crisp and fresh and complement the ahi nicely

entre brais salmon and seafood paella my salmon was cook wonder with a butterylemon sauc and came with a side of safron rice  we know that mix or valenciana paella is a combin of meat and seafood but we both assum the seafood paella as it list on the menu had just thatseafood my husband even inquir if it had bacon or anyth in it to which our server inform us it had sausag but that he could get it without she fail to mention it also had chickenso we essenti ate our meal separ as he had to wait anoth 1520 for a meatfre seafood paella

dessert churro  chocol and appl empanada the churro were crispi and sugari with their delici melt chocol and the appl empanada had a nice flaki crust 

all the food was realli deliciouseven the correct paella turn out to be wonder where this restaur lost my vote was servic they seem off point on so mani level we did have a conscienti busboy who kept us suppli with water but everyon els the hostess who didnt smile our indiffer server the food runnersno one seem like they gave a crap wrong food brought to our tableand other as we observ mix up order between my husband and iwhich is no problembut when they ask who had what and we tell them and they put it down the wrong way and walk away it say to the custom i dont care at one point when our starter came out i was reach across the tabl for a piec of bread and the food runner didnt want to wait for me and tri to put my plate down on top of my arm no joke perhap becaus it was a prix fix menu we felt like no one was put in ani effort except the kitchen

for a  rate restaur they have to impress me with servic as well as food or it not worth a return tripit no surpris i write this but i love independ restaur dont worri im not go to get on my soap box and preach about how they help the local economi by keep more of their revenu in the communiti they serv nor will i go on about the way they support other small busi by sourc ingredi and suppli local what i love most of all they take risk that mani corpor restaur wouldnt dare

tak maui dog for instanc l mean realli who open a restaur special in hawaiian style hot dog ask owner john stamataki who start his hot dog ventur last year in the build that hous ricki philli the tini structur has gotten the island treatment with tiki torch bright color and a warm friend vibe what they dont have in squar footag they make up for in charm and of cours menu offer 

the menu boast a seri of hot dog slider and some serious top there is one nag question though what a hawaiian hot dog to be honest i had no idea until i did some research end up hawaiian hot dog are just like ani other hot dog except for a slight sweeten bun some variat of garlic mayo and a laundri list of tropic flavor includ passion fruit infus mustard to chop banana and coconut 

befor i go on about the food i have to give you one bit of advic ask them to make sure they steam the bun on my visit this crucial detail wasnt fulfil so what i end up with were slight dri and most stale bun i made mention of this to the owner who quick offer to replac the order this is what i call great custom servic 

on first bite i felt deep love for mds lava dog shaggi style 550 it a beef hot dog slather in lava which is their hous made chili then top with chees and coleslaw the later make it shaggi i went further and order it maui style which mean that it will addit be top with chipotl garlic mayo maui mustard coconut and pineappl i had no idea you could pile so much on one hot dog and still have it work it a whole lot of flavor but meld so well togeth fortun the heat from the chili and hot dog also manag to make the extrem soft and what i love say squishi 

okay can meat has a realli bad wrap noth like congeal anim part to make a person run for the hill so bear with me when i say go ahead and tri a spam slider 125 ordinarili i would have never order one but the ladi at the counter assur me it was worth a tast my onli experi with spam was my mother do span sandwich come on youv had them too anyway onc you top a slice of grill spam with sweet mustard coconut and pineappl maui style i think you might have a differ impress sweet and salti is a great combo 

if spam isnt your bag go for the teriyaki slider 125 maui style of cours this version replac the spam with a tender ground beef patti and a smother of teriyaki sauc 

if you love potato with your hot dog and slider be sure to order a basket of mds hand cut french fri 175 these are the real deal tender with a slight crisp if you want sheer crunch good time order up the tater tot 175 these littl chub of shred potato come out super crispi and well season 

judg by the steadi stream of diner it seem like this indi resto is a hit with the local just be sure to get those bun steamwe were eager to visit and tri the new place in the hood  especi becaus it appear to be a sophist environ consid the locat on indian school  56th just south of arcadia  

i met my friend at the bar wait 10 minut or so for a tabl and enjoy a glass of wine  there was a nice select and the major of it price under 10 a glass

th design is simpl and unassum which led me to believ in the servic and food be of higher import  both great aspect of a success restaur  we were prompt escort to one of the best  seat in the place for peoplewatch and great oneonon convers  the set were in the way we push them asid and continu in convers  

the servic was just ok same with the food  we had a chicken and fish entre not sure which one though  an odd part of the even happen everi time that the server would come to our tabl he address us as kid  appar sit in the best seat and convers on a friday night  drink wine by the glass is not the best way to get respect or attent  

we were onli a deuc or a 2top  we werent there to be sold  we didnt order a bottl  we were occupi his money tabl dure the 7pm slot  we werent interest in small talk with him

th server size us up immedi and figur that either we were on a date or that we didnt truli get what good servic truli is at a restaur  he rare check on our glass of wine  my friend actual had to ask for a second glass while her empti wine glass sat there mortifi  

ive open restuar hotel spas coffe shop and done more in the servic industri than most my age  my friend background as a stylist is also about cater to a client be friend confid and comfortable

th finish touch to the incompet of the server  walk over to the tabl check in hand shake his head no and say  your probabl not go to have anyth els are you while set it on the edg of the table

i valu my time enough to know when the staff need some assist with the finer point of servic engag with your client offer suggest  dont sell be courteous dont judg and alway be authentic

il be back in a few week to see if they valu construct critici want to tri poke as in to jab or prod pronounc p long o k my chi town poker bud tell on the way to the cashier hold rack of check that onc belong to me

huh i reply

yeah you know poke the raw fish stuff you guy from hawaii eat he attempt to clarify

i dont get it  the hell you say i say look like a confus dog with my head tilt to one side

pok made with fish you know poke poke poke be total serious as he jab his finger into my side

y were talk ahi limu poke wasabi shoyu poke etc 

is it as good as back home  no  but it is prepar in a way that make it more approach to mainland tast  cultur share through food is a good thing

th various select of ahi poke are made from previous frozen fish  the sauc are deepli flavor but sinc the fish is not fresh when marin the flavor doe not permeat it just coat the outsid  limu fresh raw seawe is use veri spare and lack the textur and ocean flavor you would expect  sever type of poke such as the raw salmon with onion green onion soy sesam oil and sesam seed and  ahi kim chee poke exact as it name impli are not tradit but tast surpris good

pric are high compar to hawaii about 1250 per pound for frozen fish but expect  it a poke shop in the desert after all

recommend for those want a tast of hawaii or the hawaii expat jones for a fix of home

a for my bud i never correct his mispronunci  payback for poke me in the side and bluf me out of a huge potmayb this place will stick over the year the build just south of dunlap on central has been mani thing includ it last incarn a grill and steakhous but now thing seem top be look up for the locat with west valley bbq mainstay dillons

dillon open it first locat at the corner of thunderbird and the 101 in 1999 and was at the time pretti much the onli thing out there sinc then theyv becom so popular that open sever more locat were inevit ive manag to visit each store and i have to say it definit the same experi across the board with a mix of bbq southern cook and some texmex thrown in to round the menu out 

fri pickl 699 are a favorit southern treat and are exact what the name impli dill pickl that are batter and fri be veri care eat these though becaus the juic from the pickl super heat insid and can potenti caus sever burn im still pretti indiffer to these have never been blown away by them

youv probabl alreadi notic that anytim there are wing to be order i order them these are one of the easiest snack to make and also one of the easiest to mess up dillon version of crispi chicken wing 799 are serv up juici and meati under a light crunchi coat they also hold back on bath the wing serv the sauc on the side for your dip pleasur 

the name may sound typic but the flavor of smoke the chicken quesadilla 999 were far from it tender shred smoke chicken tuck insid a grill flour tortilla along with monterrey jack and cheddar chees also serv with sour cream and hous made salsa it larg enough to order as an entre 

pile high with thick cut bacon smoke ham melt cheddar chees all rest on top of a crunch fri chicken breast the chicken club sandwich 999 might give you palpit but is worth everi succul flavor pack bite the turkey club sandwich 999 is made much like it crispi fri cousin but instead use slice smoke turkey meat after one bite though the meat tast more like your typic groceri store cold cut and not from the deli counter but the stuff that come in bag over salti with littl to no turkey flavor

mak matter even wors was the salt content on the red devil pork sandwich 929 the pull pork and smoke sausag was slop up with a vinegar base red pepper sauc and then top with coleslaw it realli should have been a hit but instead left me reach for my water glass a few sip and the salti pain was gone

finish off the meal was the surpris decad cinnamon appl dumpl 599 a bake pastri wrap appl surround by cinnamon and sugar tortilla chip then adorn with scoop of vanilla ice cream and gooey appl piec

     here our experience

     four of us enter the small 20 seat restaur at 1210 there were six other peopl seat at the minimalist glass top tabl a larg and veri appet look cater order was take up anoth tabl we were given menus and told to order at the counter there were mani mani choic of entre a few warn that they would take between 20 and 35 minut to prepar  we avoid those and each one came with a choic of four side dish you can see whi a paper and pen might come in handi ken went to place our order but he had to wait for three other peopl who had arriv befor him it took a while  then he was told that my entre choic was not avail becaus they had run out of gravlax i came up with anoth select and ken went back to the counter  where anoth group of peopl had taken his place and were order anoth wait then my second choic wasnt avail either the sauc had to be reduc and wouldnt be readi until tuesday i figur id be safe with a third choic of swedish meatbal so i yell over to ken who saw that each of our order was be written on a separ piec of paper odd

     we settl in to wait for our food our drink were brought to the tabl sena eye pop when she sip the pitch black coffe the waitress said it was alway that strong and that there was no milk or half and half avail but she could bring out some heavi cream i notic that food was come out of the kitchen pain slowli one dish to one tabl a while later one dish to a differ tabl companion were left twiddl their thumb it so remind me of hell kitchen  i could hear gordon ramsey go ballist shut it down you   at about 1 pm my swedish meatbal were deliv i put the plate in the middl of the tabl and invit everybodi to dig in luckili the serv are larg we finish that off and wait anoth ten minut befor sena chicken schnitzel arriv that too was share at about 135 ken entre was brought that left leon who had order tilapia we flag down the owner and told her that we had a 2 pm engag and would like our remain dish she said shed look into it went into the kitchen and was not seen again a while later anoth staff member came over and told us that there had been a larg cater order that they had onli a six burner stove  and that 2 employe had call in sick i mention that i didnt think it was right to serv some peopl at a tabl and not other this is the way we do it were not go to chang it and howard seftel thought it was all right was the emphat repli more wait at 150 a differ staff member came over and said it would be a few more minut to our disconcert rumbl he said  and your not go to believ this  the fish has to be defrost slowli becaus of the parasit  at this point ill confess i start to laugh loud and somewhat
hyster it may have been rude but i couldnt help myself 

     we were out of time so leon decid hed take the fish to go ken went up to the counter and gave one of my valley vittl card to the parasit staff member say that the food was great but the servic terribl at which point the staff member had a meltdown yell at ken to get out of his restaur then went slam through the kitchen kick someth on the way out 

     this was truli one of the oddest dine experi ive ever had veri alic in wonderland but if you go equip with the five item mention abov youll have some excel foodi went here for breakfast last week becaus i had a groupon and it was just ok the servic was fine we had a nice woman as a waitress who was attent i thought the coffe was good it had a nice nutti flavor i order an omelet with avocado onion broccoli and asparagus i thought it was fine but noth special the chees they use didnt have a ton of flavor and i thought the home fri had a realli weird flavor the biscuit which should have been realli good was not so good it was not flaki nor did it tast like what i expect from a good biscuit the bf got the biscuit and gravi and said he like it so that whi i ad anoth star overal i would not go out of my way to eat here againi went here ever so eager my eye went wide at the menu  so mani possibl and so mani sauc to try

i opt for the standard wing and went with tri 4 of the sauc  hot damn hot chili lime and habanero honey blue chees and ranch for dip also order fri with fri sauc and potato salad

th wing themselv are nice and plump veri good qualiti and the wing are actual bread which can be hard to do well but the bread was nice and crisp and had a good flavor so all is good with the actual wings

th sauc though are lack the hot was actual more like a mild zero heat and littl flavor the chili lime was similar i could bare tell it was chili lime there was so littl flavor the habanero honey also had zero heat and was too sweet the damn hot howev was fabul it had heat and flavor but wasnt hot just for the sake of be hot so with the except of the damn hot which is the hottest on their menu if you dont like heat or lot of flavor in your wing sauc this might be the place for you this is where they lose major point the sauc is the most crucial part of the wings

th blue chees and ranch were ok but not great they didnt add anyth to the wing theyr just sorta there

th fri are realli good they are shoestr fri that are crispi and nongreasi the fri sauc was just averag they do also offer chili chees fries

th potato salad was edibl and that pretti much the best i can say about it

good servic prop for the 1 draft and all you can eat wings

overal if they could just get some better wing sauc or my tast bud sudden deterior i might be backi use to work at sunset park for clark counti so ive been to the chicken shack sinc it was chicken bonz

th blond ladi who run the regist has been there sinc i rememb she realli didnt smile or seem to have ani person at all i rememb order chicken tender in habenero honey to go with fri the meal that i got was six piec of chicken and includ a drink somehow this end up close to 11

11 that like charg me a dollar for everi piec of chicken then charg 2 for a hand of fri and then 2 for a drink plus tax i just think that a littl steep

i get home and i didnt have tender i had wingsand they are wimpyyyyyy

th sauc was good and so were the fri i just think that the price are steep and the feel of the store isnt veri welcomjust open recent  way up in no sco  is a new place to get  your local on while not as tasti as old town farmer market it still can give local a fresh tast of clean local flavor 
current they have  about 20 vendor outsid with craft foodssalsa  bread and torch good brule truck stop by there for sure 
insid a larg store front they have about a dozen more vendor with produc egg grass fed beef salmon honey and  horseradish  my favorit is produc form simpl farm  their egg herb and veggi are delight and display with french countri charm   anoth hit is the crow dairi vendor who bring local goat milk to a fresh tasti level with not onli goat chees but  a sour cream product call buckey breezea well a  marvel feta  that make recip pop

th food  drink here is excel  the atmospher is pretti cool too

th pretzel bun on their burger and sandwich are awesom  the cheesi sauc is awesom  the coconut cover chicken with the citrus ginger honey sauc is awesom  the drink are pretti awesom though they could use just ever so sliiiight heavier pours

but the execut is so far way way on the side of lack

they offer exact the same type of brunchi mimosa pitcher as maiz but for 10 instead of 15  this is good  but you get wine glass instead of champagn glass and there no bucket of ice to keep the champagn chill in  hot champagn is not good champagn  and this might just be me but you get easili thrice as much orang juic as youll ever need and i hate thoughtless waste

th menu is too small  i dont mean that in the sens that there arent enough offer i mean that in the sens that they dont describ their offer well enough  if i was a big time vegetarian which is someth you need to cater to in cenpho i would have been pretti piss that there were greasi and delici strip of bacon hug the side of my french toast this morn  the menu say noth about bacon  i also didnt know what was come with my burger  i assum it was fri  instead it was coleslaw  the coleslaw was delici but it pretti much seem like the physic menus were an afterthought creation a half hour befor open  did you know the burger came on a pretzel bun  i didnt either until it show up  good thing the pretzel bun good

th servic is extrem nice but slow and poor time  this isnt just my opinion  this has also been the opinion of the 6 other peopl that ive been here with over a few visit in addit to opinion from other that have been on visit where i wasnt there  im hope this will shape up as the staff gain more experi sinc i guess this place has onli been open a month

everyth here is fixabl so i realli hope blissrebar surviv their shitti locat long enough to work out all these kink becaus deep down and on the surfac of my tongu i realli like iti dont like the food that ive had here so far the fri are just plain disappoint 

they play aw terribl popular music that make me want to slit my wrist the music is interspers with severalsecond gap between song so my friend slight aghast exclam i would never shave it echo throughout the bar and garner our parti some awkward glanc 

the reason im offer blissrebar 3 star is bc of the bar staff and the drink price at the bar special seem to be differ on the restaur side

i like the bar space other than the echo issu get some local art on your wall  your neighbor will love you for it and will return but it would realli make it easier and more enjoy if they actual play good musicive been to blissrebar twice so far onc for an event and just the other day for a great lunch on the patio

th servic has been veri good each time  i love the outdoor patio space and the circular bar with the rebar tree

th food is solid so far as well  i share an order of comfort chees crisp with bbq chicken and onion  tasti stuff  then i share a caesar salad and a bliss burger load  i particular enjoy the burger

th bottom line is that i realli love the outdoor space here for the nice weather  outdoor dine and relax at it bestafter last night i realiz it time yep a long while in the make but i have to write the review have been here too mani time now not to write this would be an insult
  what can i say about blissrebar that im sure you may have read a few second ago skim over someon els review hell i dunno i figur i can onli give you my take on this joint
iv been to this build throughout it various incarn shape shift from one restobar to anoth it has alway remain a rather moretoler kind of establis of a color charact so to speak the design of the place is realli cool it is in all honesti the greatest outdoor bar in downtown phoenix in my regard the food is realli delici here as well a friend of mine forc some of their mac n chees on me and i love it despit be a hater of the dish in general the unisex bathroom are actual one of the more sensibl thing ive seen in a while i think have ladi traips in occasion make us fella a littl more inclin to leav the facil tidy
  the onli reason im inclin to give blissrebar a 3 rather than a 4or even a 5 is that it can be a pricier place to wet the whitstle
i expect a 9 dollar drink to be a littl stiffer than a wine cooler if onli the bar tender had heavier pours
at ani rate they serv a certain nich of the downtown communiti and they remain a solid option for ani night out howev youll most like catch me at their neighbor place down the block  whisper the lost leaf compar to a typic indian groceri store this place is veri clean and organ all the isl are proper mark and doesnt smell like a templemix smell of about 5 mil incens sticks

kitchen look veri clean and some great item on the menu with close to homemad tast their inhous sweet are just ok but they are fresh not frozen for a week ship from ny or chcago

mi onli issu here is servic the ladi at the front cash regist is so rude i dont even go insid the store becaus if her absolut no greet no smile and if you ask her a question let just say youll regret it

edit servic has somewhat improv and i feel the review should be chang a bit chang from 1 start to 3 till my next visit keep up the good work

sinc i hadnt eaten here befor when the opportun to buy a groupon to zaytoon kabob bistro present itself i elect to purchas onli one  after experienc a wonder meal there complet w terrif saffronrosewat ice cream with wafer cooki mom and i wish id bought three the max offer  

it a a step or two up from be a dive but i was complet readi to get an ear from mom i didnt which still surpris me now just think about it  i immedi look up at the wall menus to see what mom and i would like  while mom sat at the tabl sulkili flip over the paper menu  i decid on tri the steak kabob wrap while i chose the lamb kabob platter for mom especi when i saw that it includ saffron rice

a we sat wait for our food we notic that it was veri cold in there due to all of the ceil fan run on full blast  i had to retriev my sweater from the car so that mom could stop shiver  i didnt think it was necessari to have all the fan on but i didnt complain  

we were ooh and aah from our first bite  i havent seen her so happi w a meal out for a long time  i couldnt tri the lamb allergi but her plate look delici w a huge skewer of tender lamb cutlet perfect grill a generous serv of saffronsprinkl basmati rice a roast tomato and onion  httpwwwyelpcombizphotoszaytoonkabobbistrophoenixselectux1sejv2twyklxuqqi3qqux1sejv2twyklxuqqi3qq  ad more veggi wouldv made the platter better but mom realli was happi w her meal  i love my steak kabob wrap the steak chunk couldv been a littl less fatti but they were tender and juici  httpwwwyelpcombizphotoszaytoonkabobbistrophoenixselectaorqaviotjg5ulisq42hgaorqaviotjg5ulisq42hg  i wish there were more piec  id order the wrap instead of the platter bec i want the bread but i kept wish there were more veggi in my wrap so ill have to tri the platter next time and just order a pita on the side

whil the entre were delici it was the homemad ice cream that stole the show  it list as saffron ice cream but it also contain rosewat tini chunki piec of almond past and pistachio httpwwwyelpcombizphotoszaytoonkabobbistrophoenixselectuckc5weqinw6gcz1tdjwuckc5weqinw6gcz1tdjw  it was perfect  i was veri tempt to buy a pint to take home but it so delici i didnt want to bing on the stuff  it an excel end to a terrif meal  we would go back just to have this it that good

zaytoon was a bit pricey especi w it cafeteriastyl atmospher zs certain not a place youd like to take a date to  spiffi up the place a bit z  howev well be back w or wo a groupon

p  mom alreadi told me twice after meal eaten after this date we shouldv just gone to zaytooni had a crave for some taiwanes food and after check yelp yi mei champion deli came up it a small funki restaur with a veri confus order and tabl servic system there is a counter with a menu board but there is a full menu with tabl servic after figur it out we order the beef noodl soup fri stinki tofu and squid pottag 

the sticki tofu was good nice portion and came out hot tasty

th squid pottag was ok the soup was authent tast but the squid was kinda weird in texture

th beef noodl soup was not veri good at all it lack the spici bean past flavor and was wateri salti soy sauc base the noodl were ok we didnt mind it be spici but warn to peopl who dont like spici food the regular beef noodl soup is veri spicy

servic was good plenti of parkthis place is a littl like the white kid in scottsdal who listen to way too much rap  it in az center which will alway have a pretti corpor feel  second it in the old pizzeria uno and there was enough of the old decor left to still feel like one  they did do some updat and the bar look great but the updat do just enough to make it feel like it tri to be someth other than what it appear  the music that was play was great and i heard plenti that was on the playlist i had go befor i walk in

th servic was fair  it start off a littl spotti but quick pick up  server are definit the stereotyp hipster  type  take that as a posit or a negat but it definit goe far in set the tone of the place

th menu look incred  i had a white pizza with jalapeno onion and chicken  it was tasti but i felt the jalapeno were a bit overpow and i love spici food  i saw lot of item with pork belli which is excit and my updat will definit includ someth along those lines

al in all i will give it anoth chanc but was a bit underwhelm the first time outi use to drive up and down this part of town too frequent but never made a stop at the griddl a year later my chanc to stop by final came

i had no expect for the griddl but figur it was probabl alright sinc it been open for year not mani busi can say that yeah

th daili special dure my visit was the corn beef hash made from real brisket and was delici it was serv with biscuit and gravi meh egg and mayb someth els howev it was 14 holysht probabl would not order again unless my wallet was overflow with money that is a lot of money for an off strip egg and hash brown joint 

french toast and the red velvet pancak was also order the price for each at 299 was a bit of a steal consid it larg proport could easili get satisfi with one pancak the red velvet pancak was sub par though it felt more like a small cake rather than a huge pancak with chocol syrup 

skip the coffe unless you enjoy black water 

overal it cost 40 for 2 entre 1 pancak 1 french toast and a coffe a bit steep but most contribut from the corn beef hash servic was friend the waiter was nice and communic well i would probabl come back sinc my cousin love this place but definit to tri differ itemflow rider is the new truck in town they have a pretti solid menu offer burger hotdog and sandwiches

th first thing you will notic about flowrid is their portion let just say theyr big and everi order includ fri and a drink

th menu is pretti expans i had d porker which can best be sum up as a deli that explod and end up on a bun d porker includ fri pork beef bacon ham slice hot dog bean egg muenster chees lettuc tomato avocado serv on a grill french bread

it was a huge sandwich camera on my phone doesnt work so i was unabl to snap a photo but trust me it was impressive

th fri were rather forgett but it nice that they were includ along with a drink other truck are a la cart and the price can add up quickly

mi friend had the 12 loco dog which includ a 12 beef dog wrap with bacon grill onion jalapeno relish special sauc and guacamol on grill bun

h said it was realli good a littl messi but good

i like flowrid they still have a few kink to work out but given time they could becom a contend for the vega food truck crown

okher my few complaint so they can work on improv and get 4 or 5 star on my next visit

1 the fri are weak they were under season a littl soggi and were rather blah i may have just gotten a bad batch but they were pretti forgettable

2 the top there is a point when you reach overkil when a sandwich has more than 10 item on it you might be go a littl overboard all of the ingredi in my porker were great but they got lost when they were mix all togeth i actual dissect my second half and ate it piec by piec all of the meat were amaz but it may be a littl overkill

3 locat i know find place is hard when you start you and the place you were at had a ton of traffic rainbow and russel park was ok hospit lot across the street but there were no tabl bench grassi area or anywher to sit i dont mind eat in my car but if a group of peopl want to eat it can be a littl hard

4 your hour i know your new and you are still get thing work out but be open 3 hour a day 11a2p is not enough time for peopl to get a chanc to tri your grub i realli think with your portion and price you would be a better late night truck than a lunch truck you could corner the post bar greasi food market if you found the right locat and got the word out

i will give flowrid truck a few more tri and hope they earn a few more star the more qualiti truck this town get the betterive eaten at the other locat in henderson and realli like it they also have good deep dish pizza at the other locat howev the the onli pizza you will find at this one is a puff sinc the menu most consist of dog sausag italian beef and wing i had a 12 which is a 2 grill sausag with onion and pepper on bread the onion and pepper were perfect but the sausag was too dri rememb i had not just 1 but 2 of these dri sausag to work through even with ad mustard it just didnt help then my wife and i share a basket of chili chees fri howev we didnt eat but a small dent in them after tast the chili i rememb that i didnt like it at the other locat either honest i dont care that it doesnt have bean but what i care more about is that it tast like a stinki armpit smell i love chili just not here my wife order a pizza puff that i end up eat a few bite of and it surpris me how much i like it i have had more authent one at other place and this one is more like a overs totino pizza roll yet it was damn good i cant say enough about how nice the staff was they took the time to show us menus we could read at a tabl sinc the menu board here is curv and at a weird angl so you need a neck massag after look at it too long staff check on us a coupl time to make sure we were good and to see if we need anyth so that was a plus the insid is small with some tabl and a bar with stool and they have a coupl tabl outsidah happi is a new buffet in town  here rancho papa chulo where they now have a weekday lunch buffet so i drop in today to give it a try

thi is a fair larg place nice insid  it was easi to find a comfort place to sit  the music volum  the interior light were both ok

i start with some realli good chicken veget tortilla soup  a nice salad with cilantro  dress  my server brought out some warm tasti chip  salsa  then it was on to spanish rice refri bean chicken fajita chees enchilada  home style potato with chees pepper  onions

just a few gripes

  the paper towel dispens in the bathroom has a littl recess knob you have to either turn with your finger that youv just wash  are about to pick up chip with or go get some clean toilet paper to do it with

  the salsa was way too mild for my tast  no zing at all

  rather small food selection

  there were no tortilla to complet the chicken fajita onli the filling

with that said my server was friend  appreci the food was tasti overal  it an excel valu at onli 599want someth cheap good and quick so we stop in for lunch 

ive heard so much about their bbq so we order up a 2 bbq combin rice plate the roast pork has a awesom crunchi skin and the bbq pork is juici and succul definit good for the price and i would order bbq from here again they also give you a bowl of soup this was beef broth with potato and carrot 

we also got shrimp wonton soup with thin egg noodl the wonton were qualiti with shrimp black mushroom and pork i realiz the more i have simpl chines broth soup the more i feel theyr sortv one note just a person prefer but i think anyon who want a good wonton noodl soup with some green will be satisfied

they serv complimentari tea which was sortv odd tast it tast like moth ball to me and the bf said it was like spinach water  server was friend when we were order but i wouldnt say there was much servic at all we werent ever check on or refil we went to the counter to pay 

bbq definit qualiti and i would order some togo of this sometim it just one of those place that isnt bad but didnt impress either it good for all the thing they do and make for a good cheap work optioni agre with the consensus here the roast pork is phenomen the perfect balanc of crispi skin and juici meat it is littl angel danc in your mouth when you eat it 

the bbq pork and duck are alright in my opinion good but noth to go crazi over

if you order a two meat combo with rice you get your money worth no question 

i have onli order off the menu and not off their a la cart buffet i want to but with the languag barrier i am sure it would be too difficult


howev as much as i love this place i havent been as much as i would like becaus sometim order can be veri frustrat here i swear i think they understand me but choos not to last visit i want to scream i was that frustrat becaus of the order i have to give this place a 3 star i feel that if i walk away from an experi more annoy then someth is wrongthere is no guarante of tomorrow it is so import to make the most of each day and night my dear friend christi and i made the most of last friday night when we met her lifelong friend at pbr rock bar

   from a local perspect drive to pbr rock bar is a nightmar it is not like the voodoo loung or level 107 loung where you pull in from a 4lane arteri into a well design park garag the local has to maneuv through the mayham of the strip area traffic the worst part is maneuv through the planet hollywoodmiracl mile park garag it is a poor design park lot without notic that the motorist is drive the wrong way onc the local find the park spot it is a walk through the corridor of miracl mile at planet hollywood to reach pbr rock bar where the mall touch the las vega strip now if your vacat on the strip pbr bar is a short walk off the sidewalk

  pbr rock bar is realli two differ bar under one busi you have the indoor bar and nightclub overlook the mall and the outdoor bar and nightclub patio overlook the mid strip this is where the high energi is when you look up you could see the cosmopolitan tower when you look straight you see a las vega strip border by planet hollywood and the cosmopolitan in the near distanc the intermitt bellagio fountain danc and the eiffel tower stand tall in the near distanc the sidewalk are prime peopl watch look into the bar there stand the mechan bull the mechan bull is realli a symbol of their busi practic they realli take the custom for a ride by charg differ price for the exact beverag that is bull  in hindsight i regret not ride the mechan bull i think it would of been a lot of fun in realiti my eye and attent were on my compani the volum of the music was at a decibel where we could hear one anoth christi and i start out in the indoor bar when you arriv from the planet hollywood park garag you enter through the indoor bar from this angl the outdoor patio is camouflag by a wall and dim interior after christi friend call her wed find our way to the outdoor patio this is where wed spend around 3 hour of our lives

    there is an admiss price for guy even guy who drink girl drink  the admiss is 10 but it includ a drink for the las vega strip this is a decent deal the averag drink on the las vega strip is 12 and if im not mistaken a 22 ounc beer upstair in twin peak is 10 onc your in the bar a click on the yelp applic illumin the buy one get one free drink checkin the averag drink is around 12 by the conclus of the 3 drink peopl ought to be up in space mountaina state of a nice relax buzz

    by the time i drank the three drink i was up in space mountain enjoy a nice relax buzz i enjoy two blue hawaiin and a bahama mama suppos they are girl drink but i got to be a man and tell the truth they were delici but noth spectacular the bartend didnt even bother to add a maraschino cherri they came in a plastic cup they were a delici rout to get to space mountain they tast like fruit punch with alcohol now high up in space mountain  i thought i was be funni and manag to drink christi whiskey neat i am no connoisseur on whiskey but it was decent and put me to the summit of space mountain when i brought christi a replac whiskey neat i was incogniz to the idea that the bartend charg differ price for the exact drink id end the night with the least expens beer it was pbr although i was in no state to keep track of the price i think it was 5

  now back to earth and off space mountain  when i reflect on pbr rock bar i see 3 star i dislik the inconsist in price howev there is a high energi level to the place it set on the las vega strip in the shadow of the cosmopolitan tower and in the sightlin of the bellagio fountain and eiffel tower is high energi 25 for a nice buzz is a good deal most of all i enjoy the memori of spend three hour here with my friend and her friend31911

decid to hang out up here after work recent on a saturday night after have dinner at ocean trail down below  we were go to check out the wine flight but tabl servic was practic nonexist spot one server in the entir room which seem so small now that there actual were peopl all in their mid20 and mid30 a stark differ from the crowd up abov at orang sky and she spent at least 15 minut chat w the two suit sit there  thank good we were abl to take our glass of wine from our dinner at ocean trail up here  we felt sorri for the lone bartend work the bar as there were two group of about 5 or 6 who all want drink  the nate william band were play and sound veri good and there were a few peopl danc  resort manag should realli rethink about play some great housemus to get this place hop  

nice patio space but the smoker out there need at least a tabl or two to set down their drinkwhen it come to bagel einstein bagel is 3 5 star good howev they are noth in comparison to the bagel cafe and new york bagel shop sinc there is onli one bagel cafe and the new york bagel shop are near 3000 mile away my tastebud coexist with einstein bagels

    today i stop off at this einstein bagel on the way to spring mountain nation recreat area it is off the 215 freeway along durango drive and just south of centenni hill hospit it was a breez to get to

  the experi i had at this locat is realli no differ than the other einstein bagel i review i walk in i order and gave them my name i walk past the display case of bagel where i paid the cashier hand me a coffe cup befor they brought me my bagel i had the choic of few brew of coffe to fill the cup the coffe is on a par with the coffe hous chain the way that i could tell the coffe us good is that i dont need syrup in it the refil are unlimit a few minut after sit down i was bite into the toast sesam bagel with salmon shmear the bagel was 350 star good that put it on the same leagu as a dunkin donut bagel the coffe and bagel with salmon shmear duo came out to 501 not bad but not spectacular my complaint about einstein bagel which is the exact one that date back to my 2012 review on this compani is that they dont includ a side item like a pickl or potato salad it take some get use to when the new york bagel shop would includ potato or macaroni salad and a pickl with the meal even their more  nova lox sandwich dont includ a side mayb that whi einstein bagel onli last around three month in the new york market

  when i return to my car i drove toward durango drive with no enthusiasm for einstein bagel if dunkin donut was on the right side of the road i probabl would of chosen it over einstein brother my realti is that becaus einstein bagel is all vega realli has for bagel shop with the except of bagel cafe and a coupl other i will settl for 35 star bagelthis place could easili be a 4 or 45 star restaur but it was an accumul of littl thing that made me subtract the star and a half  first when i got to the podium there was no one around  immedi behind me at the bar were 3 employe  they all saw me yet not one said a wordnot so much as a someon will be right there or let me go get someon  noth nada  sever minut went by and a woman appear from a door which turn out to be the kitchen  she then seat me  littl thing 1

i had a groupon and she ask to see it  when i load it on my iphon she state she wasnt sure they were do it that way  they want a paper printout  at that point i was readi to leav so she said shed talk to the manag  he agre to take the groupon number if they could copi my id  what  littl thing 2

there are 6 entre on the dinner menu and 6 item on the dessert menu  they forgot one item from my steak and they were out of banana for the dessert  their banana supplier had not yet been there  littl thing get bigger 3

charg for a second ice tea at 3  it was a partial refil i had 13 left when she ask if i want more  bigger littl thing 4

now for the mealit was superb  i got the 8 ounc filet which was on a bed of garliconion mash potato the menu say pure but it isnt  there were 5 stalk of grill asparagus for the season veget they were perfect and the drizzl port syrup was veri tasti  the crispi tater string were forgotten or mayb they hadnt been deliv yet either

for dessert i had the gossip sundaegreen tea ice cream on powder crispi wonton with butter rum caramel sauc caramel banana and walnut  of cours the banana were missing

pl for the entre and dessert were nice done  i look at some of the photo for the restaur to see what i should have gotten  i sure wish they had gotten their delivery

im not sure if ill give addict anoth chanc  it is good but there are too mani littl thing that just add up to a subtract in the enjoy of the mealit was the wife happi hour social time for her birthday and we kind of figur wed tri mill ave sinc school was not in session and wed have less colleg kid to deal with besid wed alway want to tri canteen 

the 3 star reflect primarili servic not food off the happi hour menu i order the portobello mushroom taco they come in 3s i was impress as they were veri well done the wife had the grill fish taco and she said they were veri tasti we also order the chip and pico de gallo the chip were warm thin crispyveri good 

the patron silver tequila was tasti and smooth the hous margaritaalso veri tasti not too sweet like mani premix i order anoth tequila but was brought a patron anejo i did not order that onei did not enjoy it but our dinner companion did

our server was not mean she was actual veri friend but just not prompt they fail the water glass miser i ask 3 time for water and final had to go to the bar myself to have more water later anoth server ask if we need anyth and we all said more water and it just never show up anytim our server ask if we need anyth she didnt stick around long enough to wait for me to swallow the mouth of food i was chew on one of the tequila i order was the wrong one and our dinner companion had to ask 3 time for a tequila he ordered

also as we were seat next to the patio door we ask if the door could be close sinc it was cold our server said no someth about fire code howev when anoth parti sit behind us ask their server she said sure and close the door anyhoo

but probabl the funniest was when we ask our server about the chile relleno happi hour item she didnt know what they were and pronounc it phonect sound out the doubl l i just assum you should know a littl more about the product you are sell 

we will probabl come back becaus the food and tequila were good and the happi price were reason mayb well get a differ server next timenormal i would give 45 but the cute girl with the shrilli voic short me on the scoop 

i am sure the owner appreci it but realli for 2 buck i want my full scoop this thing was light and not solid pack as it should be 

the place was clean the servic was attent 

one other thing it is against food servic law to wipe the insid of the ice cream contain with a rag to clean the use portion of the contain they do this to keep the 12 use section look clean and desir to me it mean they are wipe germ infest rag insid the ice creamstop in after hear all the rave regard the red velvet pancak and the kalua pig benedictnot a few local hawaiian and filipino dishesportugues sausag loco moco spam adobo fri rice omelett and kalua pig for breakfast

so i ask my waitress if the owner was from hawaiino shes not from hawaii shes just been there a few time uhohi take my chanc anyway and go with the benedict and forego the potato and pay a littl extra for a side of the red velvet pancakes

breakfast is my favorit meal of the day and an egg is realli hard to screw up but these cook did a great job at that i felt like i was cut into an egg mc muffin becaus the yolk wasnt ooz like it should have if you know how to poach an egg hollandais look and tast instant and i know wasnt made fresh and how are you gonna have carnita pass as kalua pig same meat differ preparationsdefinit lack saltinesss and smoki you get from proper made kalua pigdefinit fail on execut here

r velvet pancak were good and ill just stick to the nonloc item if there is a return visit some may disagre on my 3star rate but be a stickler for 
good food done right i call it like i tast and see it and im stick to my gunsbang bangalohai came with angela h to use up my groupon ive been plan to go for a while but the close at 23pm is sometim hard for me to get to

i have been veri curious about the red velvet and the adobo rice omelett i was wonder if i can get both but no way can i dip into a short stack and a larg omelett i end up get portugues sausageegg rice w a upgrad on the 2 pancak to be red velvet 

the food is just fine i would be sad if a hype place cant fri a sausag and egg but they were cook just right the red velvet pancak were pretti good i like that it wasnt too sweet with the ice it was just right i thought i wouldnt be abl to eat it if it was too rich but i empti up my plate angela sandwich look good and i stole a chip from her which was decent 
 
servic was just alright and fair friend 

i can see whi peopl like it it is decent breakfast but was my meal wait worthi no i hear about hour  wait on weekend and i dont know if i want a pancak and basic sausag and egg that bad the bf and i might tri to bring the famili on the weekend put my name in and go pick them up so that i can tri other signatur dish to see how i feel about this place so far though red velvet pancak deserv a return visit but that not enough to say this is the place for breakfasti final came here with my boyfriend after tri to drag him here for about five month it just too out of the way for us we went on a tuesday morn and there was still a 40min wait which suck becaus we both get hangri a hybrid of hungri and angri fair quick we just sat silent perus through the menu and smell the delici scent of fresh cook food until they final call us up

sinc we alreadi went through the menus we threw in our food order when the waitress ask for our drink we both order spam and egg with pancak side i got the red velvet and he got the banana i believ both of our order were over 11 becaus we got specialti pancak and he upgrad to garlic fri rice i felt that 895 for the spam and egg was a littl pricey consid we got 3 piec of spam each and you could easili get about 10 slice of spam from a can that onli 250 we realli want a tast of home though so we both got it 

i specif told the waitress i want my spam crispi but they gave it to me soft and floppi anyway so i onli end up eat one piec my boyfriend ate all his spam but hard touch his rice becaus it wasnt what he expect it had a lot of thick long strip of onion all over i guess were both use to the filipino style garlic rice we alway get at place like nanay gloria which just has small piec of chop up garlic and that it have both chop up garlic and larg strip of onion is just a recip for halitosi 

on to the pancakes

mi red velvet pancak were nice and moist even after pile on all the whip cream and cream chees syrup they werent too sweet either they were definit good but it was the first time ive ever tri red velvet pancak and i wasnt veri blown away there are a few other place in vega that also serv red velvet pancak so it not exclus to babystack 

mi boyfriend thought his banana pancak were alright rather than ad mash banana to the batter they just put 8 small slice on top of the pancak and serv it with syrup so it actual pretti plain

i guess i had veri high expect for this place due to all the outstand review so when i went i was a littl disappoint i mean it a good breakfast joint but not someth id be will to wait almost an hour for after make the long commutpleas dont hate me but i think babystack is a bit overr  it is a good diner but i dont think it blew my sock off at all

i have heard a lot about babystack and i am alway remind when i drive past it at least onc a week  i am a devot patron to a differ local breakfast dinner and usual go there for breakfast  we want to tri someth differ so we head over to tri babystacks

our first mistak was get there at 1030am on a sunday  oop and here come a 45 minut wait  that was selfinflict pain but we dealt with it  sinc we had a long wait we had alreadi check out the menu and figur out what we want  the menu has a lot of varieti and definit someth for everybodi  this is alway nice becaus i know we can never agre on food at my hous  they have your normal breakfast item like egg dish biscuit and gravi and of cours a multitud of pancak choic  they also have a decent lunch menu with salad sandwich and burger  on top of all of that they have hawaiian food on the menu  like i said someth for everyone

i wasnt in the mood for breakfast by the time we were sat so i went with loco moco  it was good but not great  it total hit the spot for my crave but it wasnt anyth to write home about it came with a side of mac salad and it was realli pretti bland in my opinion the first time i had loco moco was in maui so i am probabl ruin sinc i compar everyon version to the first one and few compar   so it was good but not great

mi hubbi got a breakfast burrito with portugues sausag  it was a huge burrito and he was onli abl to eat about 23 of it  it also came with a side of regular pancak  the pancak were ok but again noth special  overal his breakfast was ok and pretti average

mi mini me got the kid grill chees and it was an awesom grill chees  it was super gooey and overflow with cheesi good  

now i know what you are go to say whi didnt you tri the fanci smanci pancak well i wasnt in the mood so there  mayb this is whi i am onli give it a 3 star rate and didnt get my sock blown off  we do plan on check it out again when we are crave pancak and mayb it will be better next time  for just regular breakfast food though i think i will stick with my goto place around the corner  base on this experi though everyth was ok  the servic was ok the food was ok and the price were okshe sell seashel by the seashore

recommend with the 30 off tix4tonight dealseason 52 is enjoy but still mainstream enough to bring your cracker inlaw to without freak them out plus everi dish is under 475 calori and both plate ive order have complet fill me up

rewind back to everi dish is under 475 calori for a second though

let do some basic math
you order an appet to share 300 calori split an entre 400 calori and an individu dessert 300 calories
congratul you just consum 850 calori in a meal

bottom line this place is definit healthier than pretti much everi other chain restaur on earth but that doesnt mean you can truli indulg without undo your diet basic if you order an entre and noth els youll consum less than 475 calori it a good concept but it easi to forget that the calori limit is per dish not per meali like this locat it has plenti of room for park and pump gas it is locat in a shop center that has a lot of good option from hardwar to food to nail so veri conveni to get gas or a snack while pass through 

the store is clean insid and out i alway see someon sweep the park lot
staff insid is friend i havent use the restroom befor all in all your typic but clean and spacious conveni store  dont know what the obsess is with the amount of terribl so close togeth on charleston is but it a heck of a lot cleaner than the one near del tacotook mom here for lunch on may 1st  she was look forward to it as she had seen sofrita segment on check pleas arizona on dvr the night a few day befor while i had just seen it the previous night although ive bookmark to tri this place for mani month now ever sinc i saw it advertis in the defunct redendo pizzeria on flw

mom order the shrimp street taco which she veri much enjoy httpwwwyelpcombizphotossofritafountainhills2selectxheszonlvhbeccywz17gsaxheszonlvhbeccywz17gsa  i ask what in particular was the best part of this dish for her and she said that the shrimp were of veri good qualiti big and great textur httpwwwyelpcombizphotossofritafountainhills2selectmkqlv2n89udvqz5nxn1qqmkqlv2n89udvqz5nxn1qq  i had the bruschetta board choic of four which mom was also look forward to tri sinc it was featur on the show  i order it becaus it was one of the few item i could tri other than the salad sinc the taco were all encas in corn tortilla corn allergi  their websit mention sandwich but i dont recal see ani list in their onepag menu  i chose from left to right cilantro hummus awesom flavor and one of my favorit of the four red pepper hummus didnt impress me but ive had a sensit to red bell pepper over the past few year but mom love this one  smoke salmon with egg salad el diablo and caper and dice cucumb as well for those who are allerg to cuke this was anoth one i like and chicken salad with raspberri mayo and dri cranberri took me a coupl of bite transit from the smoke salmon for me to enjoy this one  i like the textur differ from the soft mouthfeel of smoke salmon and egg salad to the chunki grill chicken cube and chewi dri cranberri  mom didnt care for it httpwwwyelpcombizphotossofritafountainhills2select8lgymml2ej3wayjjtxxk7q8lgymml2ej3wayjjtxxk7q  and last but certain not the least was the star of the show postr de caramelo or simpli santa marta a yellow cake which remind me of pineappl upsidedown yellow cake with a layer of flan on top toffe crumbl and caramel and cream sauc drizzl on top  i had the berri on the side due to an allergi yes it suck to be me  the twosauc combo also gave the yellow cake a slight tres lech cake flavor which i love  this was a big hit with mom  httpwwwyelpcombizphotossofritafountainhills2selectwdwuhi4kdouyz3cu1iavoqwdwuhi4kdouyz3cu1iavoq

325 star for now but we definit want to go back  mom wasnt happi about the price but our server who i later found out was the manag chat her up after mom left and i paid the bill and the kitchen were will to work with my allergi and tri to accommod  i love that the area is across the water fountain  i somehow miss the fountain on my way to the restaur we came in separ car and i was on my way home when i spot it across the street so i park at the shop complex and went for a stroll  i want to take mom back to sofrita so that she and i can have a stroll after  that is if i can talk her into it  btw the fountain come aliv on the hour everi hour and i was lucki to catch the show befor it turn off around the 15minut mark

p  the unisex restroom was quaintlydecor unlit ritual candl wood sculptur etc  it dark in there which may have contribut to the slight urin odor i detect possibl from littl boy andor perhap drunk men miss their mark  i didnt want to stay long enough to find out  i meant to say someth to our server on my way out but got sidetrack talk about redendo former pizzeria locat on flw that was sold a coupl of year agostop in after a downhil dine experi at en there were alot of 5star review for this place so we thought this place must be awesome

i tri the strawberrri sensat and wifey got the rebel special

whil wait for our order the crowd kept get bigger and the three peopl make everyon order  seem to get kinda nervous probabl becaus the crepe and waffl werent come out as fast as peopl were come inher why

on person was cook the crepe

on person was assembl the crepe

on person was wait with a scoop of ice cream to finish the crepe

w final got our order and the verdict great concept but tastewise
just okay i guess im a purist when it come to crepe be that ive crepe well over a hundr time includ the crepe joint in japantown sfit was a littl too thick for my like and the vanilla extract was pretti strong

execut could use some refin as wellthre peopl should be abl to knock out three order just like the homeboy at pier 39 in san francisco do with  style and finess especi if there are more peopl are come in and also now that there some crepe competit nearbyalohai have learn one veri import rule and it is that im onli allow to order bruschetta at postino period end of stori 
that said the butternut squash soup was delici as was my one bite of the steak sandwich which i might just order myself next time 

the space itself has a much warmer intim feel than expect it appear so bright and coffe hous like on the websit that it was actual a deterr i get it your space is clean and you want to showcas that but it realli doe give the wrong impress i also understand the concept of light for photographi purpos but it appear bright and uninvit definit not date worthi anyway im glad i was wrong

th cocktail list was uninspir and i dont recommend bring a beer geek here but if your into share some munchi and split a bottl of reason price wine this and about 20 other spot in the valley is your place no offens to the live room i will sure be back it just that id realli love to see a restaur owner bring someth fresh and new to the tabl i feel like everyon is do a version of this

i too notic the flicker light issu but be that im not prone to seizur it didnt bother me much the servic was on point and our server was attent without be overbear and seem to genuin care that we enjoy ourselv when question regard wine option he actual had an opinion and some basic knowledg to back it up that may seem sad to get excit about but hey ive gotten use to vapid shitti servic even come out of some seem 5 star establish 

we came we drank a lot we dine not enough and we took cheap cab ride home ahhhh the beauti of live in midtown  ill be back live room im not in lovebut your a perfect accept reboundtransit until the next best thing come alongtook em down a star for their rude azz fck pushi attitud behind the counter i told you alreadi i dont want them old azz lumpia that been sit there all day sheesh

sinc kucina ni lorrain express open up on bermuda ive been take my azz there instead latemom and pop place a littl off the beaten path in downtown chandler that realli sum it up the restaur is locat in an old hous so you realli do feel like you are sit at someon kitchen tabl have coffe we went in for a late breakfast on saturday am i had a mont cristo breakfast sandwich and the hubbi had the steak skillet food was aok good coffe and a nice place to just take your time and read the paper sinc they were not busi at all the server was a littl awkward but his mom explain that it was his first day work the front of the hous rememb what i said about mom and pop i cant say this was the best meal ive had but it was pretti good and we will definit be back simpli becaus all the other breakfast place we like just have such a long wait on the weekend 

also was an interest visit sinc i never knew this shop plaza exist even though we come to the main part of downtown chandler regular two of the shop were out of busi so i guess i am not alon i am go to write some review of the store that are still open so stay tune for that 0your first thought when walk in look how neat this place is server in pajama upsid down flowerprint umbrella hang from the ceil some even spin and overal relax vibe the wait for me is usual about 1020 minut depend on what time i get there 

like mari t this place use to be my favorit breakfast place it was also ice on the cake that it is walk distanc from my abod i keep give them chanc to chang my mind but i get disappoint everi time

mi favorit thing to order is the fanci steakhous omelet thank it tast consist has remain the same and is alway good my second favorit would be the crispi fri chicken breast and waffl i was never a fan of chicken  waffl until i ate it at this place the new york steak spinach  benedictbagel was the worst thing that i have ever order the present was extrem lack the word hot mess came to mind which made my food unappet 

the pot of bread for a side is one of the reason whi i keep want to come back but for the last three time they have been unabl to keep up with the demand and simpli say theyr out instead custom have to choos between get toast or a biscuit ugh if your a server and you see that my hash brown are either burnt or undercook then do not bring it out to me i will say someth also we keep get hand other peopl tab get it togeth guygot togeth today with robyn n mike c  jeromi h to check out this new buffet  here how it went

lunch buffet  799719 sr  outdoor seat under constructim on the fenc about this place still it could go down to 2 star or it could go up to 4 star im current exercis some forgiv sinc it just open and a few kink are pretti much inevitable

and so i sat there for awhil no one even so much as look at me though i count at least 12 staff hostess bartend and server mill around and there were onli 4 other custom in the entir restaur but ok i was wait for someon so mayb they were wait until that person arriv nonetheless seem strang that no one took my drink order brought water etc

aft the person i wait for arriv we continu to wait for about anoth 10 minut at that point a woman who i assum was a manag came over and ask if wed been help yet she then promis that our server would be right over and she took our drink order state that the drink were on her she was incred sweet and friend thing were look up

th bartend after be all befuddl at how our drink could possibl be on the manag brought us our drink one by one i was pleasant surpris to find that the draft beer select was rather decent they have the standard bud coor etc and they have the slight better blue moon etc and then also have the way better snow cap 2 below dogfish head etc

aft a few more minut our server arriv she apolog for the wait and ask if we were readi to order the nacho list is quit extens and invent and you can also build your own and all of the nacho are avail as a half or full order we settl on two half order  the buffalo hot and sloppi daddi at this point we were inform that they didnt have the chip the buffalo hot is suppos to come with ok then well just have it on regular tortilla chips

our server was veri nice and was good with time check on us etc howev it definit seem like she was veri new  new not onli to this new restaur but new to serv she was super sweet but seem a littl fluster in fact i think the same could be said of the major of the staff here and by staff i mean young thin femal with a strong prefer for blond possibl tri a littl too hard for a hooter feel

it seem to take a while for our food to arriv especi consid it is nacho but it didnt take too long so all ok the nacho were pretti good good enough to warrant us come here again the chicken on the buffalo hot was just the right size and perfect spici which in my book is on the veri hot side the pull pork on the sloppi daddi has a great flavor and the best part was that they didnt skimp on the chees unlik other plate of nacho we were not left halfway through eat with a plate of chip and no top the chees permeat everi inch of of the chip they werent the best nacho ive ever had in fact not even close but they were differ and they were yummi 

the price though did seem a littl high for what you get you can get full order of nacho elsewher for less than the price of the half order here

th manag came over two addit time ask what we had order and make some small talk and then again after the food had arriv ask how everyth was major props

th decor is nice and everyth was veri pristin sever larg flat screen in the bar area tune to differ sport channel even a coupl of flat screen in the corner of the dine section no game no smoke music was neither too loud or too soft  primarili all top 40

overal a decent experi and a decent place i fulli intend on patron here again especi to see how it is after the kink are iron out and ok yeah i might alreadi be crave the buffalo hot nacho a littl bitok this is the first review that i have felt the need to updat on yelp it look like nacho daddi has achiev the imposs they blend chip and chees actual sinc i wrote my initi review rate them a 1 they have hire a new gm 4 who know what he is do they have a new kitchen manag  who know and have cut down the menu to a point where they can actual achiev a high level of execut i think they have final reach a level of compet in which a busi can begin to win over custom and becom success 

for this i will move them up to a 3 of 5 but that is becaus i still hold my breath when i walk in and order i keep expect them to mess up my order but they seem to have a renew energi and i think it becaus they are final on the right track

let be clear the servic was never the issu here it was alway that the manag staff gm and kitchen manag could never find a consist formula that work now that the issu seem to be solv the food is reflect and it worth give them anoth chance

 it now save to eat the nacho 

ps keep it up and i will have no problem chang the rate to a 4 it that much better these daythis was our second time here in a month  this time without the kiddo and for happi hour in the bar area  this is the first place im review where i need to offer a breakdown to explain my rate  and this is a place i realli want to like sinc it close to home and we love find a great mexican food place to be loyal to  just not feel it most due to servic issu  the food has been consist good

food  4 star  both time the food has been 4 star and pretti good overal the spici shrimp nacho are our favorit  but they are skimpi on the shrimp  today we had the chicken enchilada nacho  they are veri good too  

menu  we return within one month becaus we enjoy the happi hour food and drink special some of the nacho are offer for 6 and they have 2for4 street taco among some other item  but today when we arriv the menu had chang and the food item we want was no longer on happi hour  bummer  and not cool  i dont like chang menus  it bait and switch  the waitress said we want to remov our popular item and replac them with other thing so you would tri differ nacho  hmmmm  

addit while order drink from the hh menu we ask about chip and salsa  we arent tri to get anyth for free  but you would think with a 25 bar tab  they could provid free chip and salsa  nope  it 3  

mi husband ask for a side of jalepeno for his nacho platter  they brought a littl sauc cup with about 10 littl jalepeno  then we got the bill and they charg us 2 for them  not cool  at least tell us they will be extra  but realli they should be free  

i enjoy the bogo free margarita at happi hour 8 which might be the onli reason i returnafter my first visit to nacho daddi i didnt think id ever come back see the reason here httpwwwyelpcombizphotosnachodaddyhendersonuseriduycmgbelzra0q6jqzloguwvvscsr6z5ae2neuxkqxwq near two year later we return for trivia night and it was a much better experi border on 4 star but not quit 

we arriv around 630 for trivia that start at 7 one of the great thing about this place unlik other place in town that host trivia is that they allow you reserv tabl that awesom servic was incred slow as trivia got underway understand sinc they were pretti busi but honest if the restaur know they get busier on these day they need to staff accord we decid to share some nacho florentin and they were so much better than our previous visit to nacho daddi i was pleasant surpris the flavor were nice but i still wish they would spread out the top better so that your not left with ton of plain chip on the bottom of the stack i appreci all the differ nacho offer they are quit creativ 

servic was slow throughout albeit friend we won trivia that even which was a blast so well be back next week to spend out 50 in win hope i can tri some of their other offerthe bf and i were peel out of the park lot of sin citi sushi when i see a few door down a tv has dessert flash and one was french macaron 

is this for real ive been search for these around town and must know and tri all the limit place that make the effort to make such a labori and temperment item

bf and i decid it was worth park again to find out we roll in and ask if they have them 

no  not yet 

the owner were the one at the counter and explain they just open monday and that they havent actual tri to have one of their girl who claim she can make them do up a batch yet what so it on the menu but the recip has never been tri i wish them well and hope they can figur it out but it is not for your averag baker to finess the line of make a delight macaron or just a candi coat biscuit with some cream it not someth you just wing the guy said her bake is hit and miss lordi i know the job pick are tough but id have test out peopl heavili befor open a store with their product hit shelv special they said someth like it take them 4 hour to make a cupcakehear this shit is real worrisom you know what i can do in 4 hour as a passion home cook i made a cake with 5 tier of cupcak i individu frost then dip in chocol and decor with edibl pearl candi and purs and im not even a baker 

they are also suppos to have homemad yogurt and ice cream that they can make into shake or they have the usual fresh top bar for yogurtsbut also come soon the cupcak has a two tier counter and onli one tier had some cupcak half full 

sinc im here i got a red velvet sinc that is my standard test it simpl and if you can do the simplest thing well then you might be onto someth i got it to go sinc we just glutton out next door 

i ask for a busi card menu whatev so i can put up the menu addi and all that on yelp but appar it alreadi been done and there a 5 star review up alreadi from an orangeheadwith pictur from their stock photo hrrmmmand open 6 day ago onli no market has been done or materi print out 

i wish them well as i do with all small busi but that organ of a busi plan is messi the basic are miss im be construct and point it out becaus even though im just a  young person most peopl dont take serious busi is kinda the famili profess even if i didnt know about busi i would think figur out all the stuff beforehand is common sens 

 if your put someth on the menu it should be thing you alreadi know and have trial to a consist recip itll tank if peopl are your trial and error guinea pig til you get it right sure not everyth is perfect open up but there should be a margin of be sure of the direct they serv cupcak coffe drink yogurt milkshak french macaron you can get few flavor of cupcak and coffe so 25 of the menu is not readi bf is put a new dj set togeth doesnt matter if 100 or 1 million peopl are listen it has to be the best he can do befor the public get it be familiar with your place so if shit happen you know how to work it outthey were still learn how the blender work even 

build up hype befor an open is paramount you open door and then you expect it to just happen learn to twitter like a teen with noth better to do be the fiercest facebook page canvass the neighborhood and invit your peer for a special open invit various interest group that might be into your stuff a meetup dessert group or yelper perhap  this is the abc and they got to xyz already

 after drop into nordstrom we pop it open on the way home there was a chocol cover cherri on it which was cute frost was not badveri cheesecakey then there the cupcak it was veri dri and dens i know this didnt have enough butter or creamand who know how much volum they do vs how much they made so it might be from the fridg and not fresh the guy said someth about our stuff is on pointim not tri to be dickish but with what 

a few mile radius to freed noth bundt cake nielsen frozen custard etc etc gotta stand out from the get go becaus theyr household name who have figur out solid recip and have qualiti control i got the best cupcak place in town by my hous retro cupcak so it big shoe and expect if im gonna run off across town to come in 

ill check on this place next time im down in the area though clear they arent prepar at all to be with the storefront open give it a few month and mayb theyll get it togeth i will return becaus i give new busi a chanc to improv im just worri for this place thoughthe food is about a 3 the awkward path to order and pick up is a 2
so i brought my lunch with me to work today  unfortun someon took it upon themselv to enjoy it for me  so that left me with 30 min to find a place to get lunch and bring it back to the offic  
this was my first trip to vitamin t  have read the soso review i decid to check it out for myself  
walk in i didnt know where to start i had to weav my way through patron stand and eat at the oak barrel random place and the other in line fill up their littl salsa cup at the salsa bar  i awkward made my way to the flat screen menu  
torn between the sonora dog and the caramelo i went with the barbacoa caramelo and an order of guacamol no drink 874   i preceed to wait initi awkward close to the kitchenbar and some folk eat on barrel then decid to get my own salsa  as my number was call i had to again becom rather intim with the stand diner posit around the barrel back up to the front  they provid sack to pack up your food for take out  i threw everyth in and again weav my way through the barrel and peopl yet again   

the food
th caramelo are serv in 2s grill flat with 2 tortilla each then fold in half the fill of chees and meat are generous the barbacoa is light season and tasti  from the salsa bar i choos the salsa verd roast serrano pepper and the small batch of red salsa in the back  here the red is better than the green  and the roast serrano are nice spici 
the guacamol order come with chip  not home made but tasti the guac itself is quit lemoni with garlic chunk of tomato onion and cilantro and a flavor more akin to black peppermeh it is okit a great mix of peopl and a fun time

th dirty
whil there were cocktail waitress not one came up to us ever we were there for 4 hour just saying

andreai came here for dinner with a friend the other night it was our first time here so of cours were excit 

so we start with the garag fri let me just say these are probabl some of the best fri that ive ever had they came with this chipotl dip sauc which was amaz i almost felt like i enjoy these fri more than my meal for my entre i got the garag burger i didnt feel like it was anyth special ive definit had better burger i got sweet potato fri but the garag fri are wayyyyy better 

they have a cute littl outdoor patio that you can sit at and enjoy the amaz weather right now as far as custom servic it was extrem slow and disappoint we had no silverwar when we sat down when we ask for some for some strang reason the waitress onli brought one set for my friend not sure if we were suppos to share it or what 

everyth was pretti pricey as well i probabl wont come back dure dinner but will definit be come back for happi hour to enjoy their fri and wine  vega express sushi ves can be found all over vega  they are usual the supplier for premad sushi at supermarket and the like

howev there are a hand of locat that will make some basic sushi item for you on the spot  mind you this isnt a place to sit and dine but rather to order and go  they dont offer anyth fanci in term of a sushi bar to view the good either  their menu is simpl and to the point

at this particular locat they also sell alkalin water and filipino good  yes their specialti is water and filipino item from the dri can or frozen  we were pleasant surpris with all the differ item that had stock in this littl market  im sure there a markup versus visit seafood citi but it save you the gas money in this case

nonetheless it your local water sourc filipino groceri store and take out sushi jointopen late last year local bistro seem to be hit the sweet spot in north scottsdal with well price food drink and a snazzi yet comfort atmospher head the kitchen up is chef andrea volpi who bring a fresh approach by sourc mani of their ingredi from local purveyor 

showcas his talent was appar from the first tast of his heaven prosciutto pizza 12 the hous made mozzarella was delight meati with just the right amount of pepperi arugula and salti prosciutto even fri basket basic like calamari 9 were light crisp and tender without an ounc of excess oil

th menu is pretti straight forward with plenti of mass appeal includ pizza pasta steak and fish i usual have a rule about eat fish in a land lock state how fresh can it be right defi my own rule i went ahead and order lbs ahi tuna tartar 10 good thing too becaus it was as fresh as it could be mix with avocado and atop a bed of citrus creme the textur was akin to butter with note of lemon which onli ad to the light of this starter i prefer slather the mixtur onto the pillowi moist crumb of lbs hous bread in lieu of the accompani crostini

im think drunk bread 12 is more about textur than tast they take thick cut bread soak it in white wine mount it with gruyer chees and then it goe for a quick sun tan in the broiler the result wasnt exact burst with flavor but the luscious charact was pleasant though not entir satisfying

thes day everi place has some sort of hamburg on the menu with more burger come a higher standard and the question which has the best let me tell you that lbs angus burger 12 rank pretti high all the standard are intact with some delici variat includ grill tomato asiago chees and zinfandel brais onion smokey sweet tender and juici this burger was so happen that in futur visit i would be hard press to order anyth els 

chicken parmesano 16 wasnt exact what one might expect a larg organ chicken breast was pound out bread fri and serv onli with a layer of parmigiano chees on top san red sauc this combin was well balanc with a light dress salad of cherri tomato and arugula sauc on the side

a i sit here write about how well their food prepar im still haunt by the mediocr servic we receiv it got so bad at one point that we actual got up out of our tabl to find basic like salt and pepper after that our server was more attent but i still had a stick in my craw i order a basil gimlet 9 which arriv in a standard martini glass that was onli half full or was it half empti metaphor asid i call our server on it in which i got a shrug that how we serv it it not a deal breaker but come on stingi and bitchi realli while there wasnt much in the glass it was a tasti drink leav me want anoth 

asid from the servic problem the food was spot on now this make the glass half full righti came with the bf final after want to tri this but rare have the opportun on a weekday to be off togeth we went for dinner on 620 

they have gotten rid of the 5 cours and now do 3 cours for 16 

appet we share isra cous cous salad with  cucumb carpaccio and pickl  red onion it was veri simpl and not much to it but it was clean and refresh veget medley with appl in a light curri cream sauc serv with pilaf in a tomato was actual realli good the veget were all cook just right to where they are soft but still have bite the curri was realli nice it was actual pretti hearti and could be a meal in itself 

entre i had poach salmon saute spinach and rice pilaf the poach on it was done right and the rice and spinach was season but it was miss someth there was a bit of sauc berci and the descript said basil oil which i did not see so it may have been forgotten the bf had herb mustard pork loin which we thought was odd to have been thin slice and batter sinc the descript didnt realli sound anyth like how it was it was a tad salti for the bf and my tast the buttermilk cheddar mash potato were good the veggi were cook well and the parmesan roast tomato was a nice tasti touch 

dessert the almond cooki duo one plain one chocol were nice and crumbl and were pair with a well done bright raspberri sorbet the panna cotta though was more like just white jello there was too much gelatin in it when it should have been just enough to set the cream mixtur 

overal though the food was good and there was some pride in present 

the servic was alright our server was didnt say much at all and was softspoken to where some of it we didnt know what she said i found it weird that she  never came up to ask us how everyth was while we were eat never check on us if we need anyth no thank for come come see us again have a good night etc at the end of the meal  it a open room and we can see a lot of the front staff is hors around and talk includ our server instead of do their job when walk out there was a bunch of server and the maitr d by the door who did not greet peopl leav becaus they were talk amongst themselv and have check out alreadi 

 i get that this is still school but your still serv real peopl who are pay money so this is just like ani other busi some peopl didnt seem to take it veri serious or learn much from school from how they present themselv as server mayb harsh but if these are student that are go to graduat soon then i would think they would cover basic servic point so i feel it fair to call them out on it 

upon dine im a bit surpris that there wasnt ani comment card for dinersif this is for the student to learn from shouldnt they hear feedback on the good and bad i know that mayb they dont want to hurt feel with realli ragey commentari but perhap the instructor can read and use valid critiqu into instruct the class hope the school read yelp at least 

it my first time and i know it chang with each class i will be back as the concept is interest and the general qualiti is goodive been go to tri this place for a long time and final did so last night  i had issu with each of the cours but i am still give it and aok rate as these are student and not profession yet

in two sectionsfood and serviceil review techniqu and for the food im use descript direct from the menu

th food

a basket of three roll was broughton multigrain one rye and one regular roll  the herb butter serv with them was veri good

cours 1  i chose the beef carpaccio with char beef sirloin shave parmesan truffl oil balsam reduct black pepper field greens

th salad was veri good  the balsam reduct dress was veri tasti and the field green were fresh  the problem here was with the prep  the beef was place on the salad plate some time befor the salad was creat  it had then been refrigeratednear to freez it seem  as a result the thin beef slice stuck to the plate  i can understand the need to avoid expos the carpaccio to room temperatur but this was realli a cold plate  the server ask me if i want fresh ground pepper and she use the peppermil  nice touch

cours 2  pork tenderloin saltimbocca  prosciutto sage butter asparagus risotto marsala semi glacé  the pork was cook way too long make it name incorrect  instead of be tender it was difficult to cut and much of the flavor was wrung from the pork  the prosciutto on top was veri good and the risotto was not bad consid it was made in advanc and pipe from a pastri bag and kept warm in some hit water  there were two asparagus piec a littl meager even given the reason price of the meal the server ask about fresh ground pepper for the main cours too which was welcome

cours 3  chocol lava cake peanut butter ganach and vanilla bean ice cream  the problem with dessert was that the chocol cake was veri dri  either it was older or it was bake too much  the peanut butter ganach was nice and the vanilla bean ice cream was good

th service

th woman who serv my tabl greet me when she came with the menu but did not identifi herself by name and she did not tell me the soup of the day nor the catch of the day  it was when i heard a differ server at the tabl behind me introduc himself by name and then list the unpublish thing on the menu that i knew they existed

mi server was attent came back dure each cours to see if everyth was ok  she refil my ice tea without ask but i had to request the sweeten a coupl of minut after she brought my glass of ice tea

im not sure if it was the server or the school but i would recommend not bring the bill while im eat dessert  cant it wait  also it realli is best to clear the tabl of dirti dish befor bring the bill back  you do need to have some room to put the holder down and sign the charg without move plate asid  the remov of use sweeten packet was a fail  

in spite of the thing i found wrong with the dinner i will be go back  it was interest watch the student prepar the dish through the glass of the kitchen  the food was passabl and hope the student and staff from le cordon bleu read review and improv from the review  i was told the menu chang everi 3 to 4 month  ill give it some time and then ill stop in again

edit  the price is now 1895 for a 3 cours meal and that includ nonalcohol beveragi was look for a new breakfast place to mix it up a bit and tri someth new i was hook when a previous yelper mention that the pancak were so good that her husband want to hug the chef i am definit a sucker for pancakes

it was a beauti saturday morn so i  decid to eat outsid on the patio the tabl are too close togeth becaus it seem like your hear too much of the convers at the adjoin tabl in my opinion the 3 pancak were huge although for some crazi reason they give you a small thimbl of syrup and enough butter for mayb 1 12 pancak so i had to request more syrup and butter for my pancak the pancak were good but not hug the chef good

i will eventu return to the tyrst cafe to sampl other dish i rate this establish three star or aok which is the definit of 3 star on yelp72811

took mom here for happi hour and the whole experi was just 25 star but i round up to three sinc the chees and charcuteri plate was solid and i was given a second chanc at a cocktail when the first the mojito was not veri good so mom order a bloodi mari but she didnt like it either  we couldnt wait to tri the threehummus plate but we werent impress  even the sweet potato tot couldnt cut it  just the meat and chees plate satisfi  the chocol chip bread pud was a huge disappoint veri dri and not much chocol flavor

i met a friend at perk for a weekday lunch last wednesday  id been want to tri it for awhil and wasnt surpris to find it hide in a strip mall like so mani littl gem here in az  the atmospher was noth special but we chose to sit outsid as it was a beauti day  my friend had an omelett and i had a greek salad  the servic was not attent despit the fact that there were few patron while we were there  i have a feel they get slam for weekend brunch though  the food was good not mindblow but decent  i like the fact that they use fresh local and organ ingredi  one more perk is that i believ they have free wifi but i cannot attest to use it

w came realli earli for dinner we were run errand and want to eat earli and get home

they were serv all daywhich is a major plus the hostess gave us lunch menus along with our dinner menu howev lunch had been over for 25 min
anyway our waiter was nice he bought our drink and bread quickly
th food is veri cheap price wise  so for the  you cannot complain
but it realli has no flavor it is veri plain
w both chose the soup which was realli good minestrone
food was good  just not a lot of flavor
of cours it is an italian place own by greek so they will have thing a littl differant
aft we got our food we sat for a veri long time with no drink our waiter seem to of disapp for 20 min mayb they have thing to do in the back befor their shift end but the hostess walk by us sever time i think she should of ask us if we want refills
not a bad place just not a great place it serv the purpos of a quick  fair good dinner they are do someth right they have been around for yearit all start with the drunken monkey which pretti much should be my tribal name from now on hand down the best milkshak i have ever tast in my life it malt banana gelato peanut butter crisp frangelico and price at 11 whoever decid to start make alcohol milkshak should get a medal genius it is the perfect marriag of flavor without be to overpow by the booz 

on to the grub 
starter 
philli cheez steak spring roll with udder sauc 11 
they were alright but could have use more season the meat was tender and the roll were crisp i did not enjoy the utter sauc which bare similar to ketchup but with more vinegar 

for the beef and fake beef select we had 
the classic with two dollar cheddar ridicul 15 
urth burger with one dollar swiss 14 
new delhi chicken 14 
all serv with shoestr fri and that gross utter sauc i order ranch of cours and they turn out to be the winner of best potato in a support role to compliment the monkey shake as far as the burger go my burger was order medium and came to me veri well done i ate one third of it the bun was butteri and toast to perfect and that two dollar cheddar was worth it the veggi burger was probabl my favorit of the three with a strong mushroom tast pretti good the chicken burger could have been execut better the chicken lack tast and the onli save grace was the apricotd chutney on top 

overal i will absolut be back becaus the cosmopolitan is a good time and that shake has my heart and waistlin captiv the menu has ton of creativ option that intrigu me such as bull ball crispi pork belli bun and duck confit street taco i will get the tribe togeth and give it anoth go at itafter object evalu this place in my head i gotta stick ya with a three mayb im a burger snob mayb im too spoil by the absolut majesti that is lunchbox laboratori here in seattl but when it come down to it the burger was just good noth to realli write home about and pretti pricey when it all come down to it i order the nom nom burger a kobe beef patti with chees and potato chip it was good but id rather call it the nom burger definit not deserv of the doubl nom and far from the omnomnom majesti that is lunchbox laboratory

their spike milkshak were super good but that realli wasnt enough to push the score higher

th ambianc is fantast though a great vibe excel servic but then again i come to expect that in vega so this end up be a wash it all about perspect ya dig

i dont believ id go again but thank for the treat and realli it wasnt bad im just spoiled

3 onenomjuston star out of 5hostess friend and prompt she took down my info and told me they would text when a tabl was readi that an awesom featur who want to stand in front of holstein for 30 min when you can grab a drink and sit in the sport book i receiv the text although we snag a spot at the bar befor it came

nom nom burger 1650  kobe beef cheddar chees potato chip 1000 island is a hard item to review on one hand the beef was realllllli good flavor moist cook to a perfect medium on the other hand the top ad 0 my theori is they need to tripl what they put on top the burger when you serv a thick burger you need equal thick top otherwis you get one bite top and then three bite beefrepeat conceptu awesom it fail to execute

they had a nice snap to themjust the way i like it  it nathan which is normal veri goodbut for some reason the airport locat arent as good  this one was just averagebut it did the job and i was no longer hungry

return factor  60i am alway in search of a restaur that serv realli good beef noodl soup  so i was excit to see the interior of this restaur be put togeth a few month ago

i final came here with anoth yelper for dinner and to give their food a tri the restaur was not busi at all i was the onli in there while i wait for my friend so servic was quick when we place our order

i order the beef noodl with wide noodl 799  the flavor was goodth noodl were chewi the way i like it but the beef could have been brais longer  i think china mama and even aychung noodl has better beef noodl soup so i will like tri someth els here in the future

mi friend tri the babo mian which he said was good  699

we also order an appet that was on one of the paper tape to the wall the chicken was good just a littl pricey for the portion

overal i thought the restaur was decent  the food was adequ price was alright   wifi is free but there is no place to plug in your laptop

decor 35  noth special  just a fast food restaur kind of furnitur and decorations
food 35  okay but definit room for improvement
servic 45  efficient
loc  45  in china town  close enough for the tourist stay on the strip and local want to eat at a restaur on spring mtn

cash onli which my friend said was the reason whi he didnt dine here sooner as he didnt have cash when he initi came here  i know it is a busi decis to process credit card payment but it seem that it is a small busi expens to cover to not lose potenti busi from those intend to pay with debitcredit cardif you order the royal you cannot request an over easi egg fri onli and over done

so i have this love hate affair with all thing diner i love the nostalgia and the feel i typic hate the food

th burger here were just okay for me it was hard for me to love andor enjoy becaus i so bad want the royal burger with my egg yolk all nice and runni but they couldnt and wouldnt make it like that someth about health regul must be all the old peopl and kid that eat there or someth pleas explain whi some place can do this and other cannot howev the patti was pretti moist and juici and the top fresh and good

th fri were good as long as they were hot onc they got cold forget about it it was just not good

i also order a milkshak and i have to say one of the wors ever i dont know what i was expect becaus everyon was say that their milkshak were bomb but they truli were the nastiest part of my lunch

i took it to go to be polit and threw it in the trash when no one was look it was like it was made from old ice cream that had melt and was refrozen three or four time over yuck

i would onli visit again if you twist my arm and were a guest visit and realli realli had to go

i will say that this place is super cheap and super budget friendone of us had a crave for burger so check my handi yelp app to see what was nearbi bam steak n shake was the one that mr b and i agre on it a midwest childhood favorit of his and i like their mid afternoon happi hour menu where drink and shake are half off 

anytim we have visit here the place is pretti busi and not veri mani vacant tabl but we get seat right away the wait dure mid afternoon is never less that five minut 
 
greasi burger i kid you not  especi if you order the wisconsin butteri burger i justifi order this sinc it my cheat dayweekend and i depriv myself of butter laden everyth late the burger maker must have knew that too becaus when i got my plate that burger was drip in a pool of buttah no lie it didnt help either that the grill onion were drip in greas as well pretti much the bottom part of my bun was soak in a combin of butter and greas ick  lucki i dont eat much bread so no loss on me it is what it is call the butteri burger but that was bit much
 
the steak burger patti are thin season wise it mia good thing for the fri season by the tabl i ad some and it gave it a littl punch to both my burger and skinni fri  hmm mayb that how theyr design to be made plain make you add your own season in hope that youll buy a bottl becaus that exact what i did 

plus point for cloth napkin  name a fast food chain  casual place that has themi cant think of ani 

shake they are thick realli rich i like get strawberrybanana they give you plenti i never can finish it happi hour it a bargain so it no biggi that i wast 12 of my shake
 
servic  this is where i have a beef pardon the pun
sometim it great and on point other time servic is not there like our server this past visit onc we got our burger order and our ticket that was that  we want to add milkshak but we didnt see our server nor ani other server in the dine area for about five minut  even the diner in the immedi area were wonder where the heck the server were  so minus point here

our meal for two with burger fri chili  drink and the milkshak came just over twenti one bucksthat pretti cheap  it probabl whi we dont mind come here but ill hold off on the butter next timewind down a great trip to vega we stop here for lunch on the way back to the airport  the menu is full of item i want to tri  i settl for

th fri pickl were meh noth to realli speak ofth bread was bland  lack flavor

th fri mac n chees was awesom  if i could make these at home id make a whole bowl of them and eat them while watch a game  

the bacon bbq burger was pretti good16 good  nah but it was good  i understand that it the strip and price would be high but for 16 at a place call i love burger i was expect to be blown away  that said ill come back again and will tri a few more menu item it that interest to me

w dine at the bar and the servic was realli good

return factor  90came here just for a quick bite to eat this i love burger is locat in the palazzo shop just a few step away from our hotel elev at the palazzo as soon as we step in the hostess seat us right away but it took the server longer that it should to come over and acknowledg us i almost got up to leav when she came while she was pleasant and we didnt wait to long to get our food wait servic wasnt a prioriti with her sinc she purpos hid behind the pillar to gab with staff

whi i say she did this on purpos i was wonder where she was a good five minut mr b need a drink refil i saw her then step out from behind a white pillar at the back of the restaur  i was about to catch her attent when she jump back behind the white pillar and kept talk to her co worker loljeez   i guess her convers was more import  the angus burger slider and  mac and chees nom nom were good portion wise just right and price were your tourist trap price i expect that just didnt expect inattent servic so our dine experi for this visit was aokayso when two filipino end up near the strip decid on lunch it almost feel natur wed end up at a buffet to nosh sit and kill time 

i think i will get to the strongpoint first

meat especi pork dish serious the steamship pork they were carv miso glaze pork loin char siu pork belli steam bun were all tasti and perfect cook pork is usual a buffet fail but these are juici and perfect cook the steamship with a bit of the onion marmalad and chimichurri was worth a 2nd carv the other meat like the turkey kalbi rib and linguica was good too if i just want to sit and gorg on meat i would consid go here for 22 than go to a brazilian rodizio for 40 

salad i know it just an ef salad but buratta chees with crush pistachio serv with frise in red wine raspberri vinaigrett is a winner

gelato plenti flavor and well made

dec cure pepper salmon chees farro tabuleh goat chees roast tomato salad creami polenta with mushroom pizza clam in a stew but they realli should have just left them plain in butter sinc the clam were fresh but the sauc isnt good alreadi peel shrimp cocktail 

now onto the fail 

the concept of littl serv plate seem cute and differ but it simpli doesnt work especi on the item they are do cover or not these are item that shouldnt sit so they realli need to consid that in them they also serious need to give you like a cafeteria tray two of them fill a plate risotto serious rice seiz into itself and get mushi gnochi turn into a gummi mess like a mochi cappelli pasta look mushi so i didnt even tri mac n chees got hard on the top seafood like poach cod was gross 

dessert were veri pretti but some were spit out worthi gelato was the best thing there with plenti of flavor and good consist this littl mouss chocol cup was decent the strawberri dip in chocol were sweet i saw macaron with fruit and i was expect them to not be great but they were ined it tast like the purpl food color and rust chlorin water some dessert didnt even make fuck sens like a veri tart mango pure with chocol mous and pearl and fruit jelli on top this was where the major of food wastag was sinc a lot of it wasnt ani good i rather have a big bowl of ugli look bread pud from sam town buffet than aesthet pleas but palett scare dessert 

servic was alright plate didnt sit so long but we didnt get mani plate for the time we sat around i like that they do give you water for the tabl sinc sometim you just need someth to drink and dont have anyth they werent bad on the refil of my tea though 

it not a buffet i would recommend for that pricepoint but i suppos it wasnt terribl im a pork meat person so the larg amount of pork cook right was a definit win mayb if i had tourist friend go there anyway i wouldnt mind go but i do not think it a place id seek outfriend and i decid to give this new buffet a tri after hear all the great review  i had gotten no more than 5 hour of sleep over the cours of 48 hour combin of work parti gambl and attend a confer  after monday seminar head back to my room at the palazzo and decid to find some food  i want to dine at lateli but my buddi isnt a huge fan of french and want to dine at a casual restaur  we couldnt come to a conclus as to where to go so i threw out wick spoon  

valet the car and proceed to look for the buffet  there are some sign that point you in the general direct but of cours we got lost  end up ask the secur guard where the place was and we were told to back track and head up the escal they need to have more sign for new visitor  was surpris to find the place fair empti perhap it was due to the fact that it was a monday and we were eat at around 630  

i was told by various cab driver that the food qualiti is just so so but they realli do spend time on the present of all their dishes

tri various dish and found some that i like and other that were just averag  my complaint for the night were with a few of the dessert and also with their roast beefprim rib  the beef serv was tougher than what id find at norm and had virtual no tast at all  i did fall in love with their bean sprout dish season with seasam oil vinegar and soy saucei think  their gelatoic cream were averag but they had these huge chocol cover strawberri  

servi was ok and notic our waiter onli take away 23 plate at a timehomi need a bigger tray or hire more peopl to help clear the tabl  there were sever time where we had stack of plate just sit in front of us while the server just casual walk around carri drink or just 12 dish on his tray  as other have state this buffet is veri afford at 35 person  will go back again if im ever in the mood for a buffetdisappointed

i will have to give it a three becaus it realli wasnt worth the hype upon first enter ani buffet i usual come back to the tabl with two full plate in my hand becaus 1 i like to tri everyth at the same time  2 i onli have two hands

at wick spoon buffet i reach the end of the food counter with onli one plate in my hand gasp confus i went back to recheck nope i hadnt miss a section there just wasnt enough select of food usual at buffet i leav the restaur feel deject that i didnt get to fit as mani bite in my stomach as i can at wick i felt underwhelm and insult      

the food also tast veri averag we left this place confus and confusi definit have mix feel about this buffet after come here for lunch with the lady

wick dislikes

i found the carv stationseri lack for a carnivor marrowand baconand sausageswith a chef that tell peopl to wait all the time to the point that peopl grab stuff themselv what a joke look im not complain that there is no prime rib or slow cook rib or a rack of awesom hot be unavailableit pretti sad for a meat carv section when i pass by more than 10 time to find the chef clean his area like he has ocd becaus he has noth to serve

salad and greenswher are thee you are miss just like the meat in the meat section littleoverkillonthedressingcaesarssaladinabowl is the onli leafi green available

chines foodomfgyou fall under the definit of crap the packag which use minichinesepapertakeoutlittlebox was freak awesom though

korean bbq their version of galbieasili has the highest turnov for ani meat at the buffet sinc im sure peopl are tri to get their meat fix one way or the other and have been clear this mound of meat within 1 min after the chef pile it onwel tast nasti overmarin 5060 fatjust saying

wick awesome

steam clam youll find these beauti in a bowllusci present the innerselv to you with hint of tomato and garlic this becam my stapl dish dure lunch hereand i raid that section with the assist of the ladi as wellthey put 20 out we grab 5 bowlsgangnam style it wasnt long befor the chef got the hint that their clam were a hit at 2 pm and replenish it repeat all the way to close time

now here the thing that prevent me from ding the crap out of this place when it price on averag higher than most other buffets

it seem like wick spoon buffet forgot to add one word to their name and that is desserts

i dont even eat dessert i remind most peopl that i dont care about dessert but i found myself eat a lot of dessert here

wick verdict

definit not a meateat paradisea this place was creat for you freak sugar addictnot mani place are worth an hour and a half wait in line but wick spoon is

yeah there will be a ridicul wait first youll have to wait in line to pay about 45 minut and then when your all stoke that you get to eatther anoth line to be seat anoth 45 minut and the entir time you see peopl roll out of the restaur too stuf to walk the price was just under 40 not cheap but well worth it you can also upgrad to bottomless mimosa and bloodi mari for a few extra buck   

so this isnt your run of the mill buffet this buffet is what up it is a perfect hangov cure becaus it has got everyth you could imagin all sort of brunch item my person favorit were the french toast and egg benedict there were also vast quantiti of bomb meat chicken pasta the gnocchi was just wow sea food everyth damnit 

the servic was a bit slow the day i went but appar they had understaf that day the waitress was also super nice and realli apologet 

the weakest link were the dessert the assort wasnt great the best part was probabl the thai tea gelato which was crazi goodive had wick spoon bookmark for the longest time  i had plenti of opportun to eat here but promis my teenag that i wouldnt eat here without her 

so it set shes in town for a coupl of day and wick spoon was on her radar this time around i swear shes a yelper in train  we purpos arriv about an hour near close becaus i figur that the line wouldnt be as bad then  i was right onli wait about 20 minut to get into our seat  overal servic was great and for that i cannot complain  i feel the ambianc and the decor  i even love their tabl and wish i had that pattern at home  but this review is about the food right 

in my opinion if youv been to one buffet in las vega youv been to them all  the dish here are serv in miniport which i think is great for pictur  but lousi for a buffet  when i think buffet i think as much as i want  give their fri chicken wing as an exampl  you get two piec present in a cute stainless steel strainer  but if i want 6 piec i would have to grab 3 of these bad boy realli how about their angri mac n chees  the portion are small and if i want a littl more than im grab multipl tin of these  again great for photo but not conveni for eat  this is pretti much the experi with all their minidishest  by the time i was done ive tri their fri chicken roast chicken salmon sushi dont do it mac n chees and their garlic pizza  all were just about par with everi one els on the strip  not bad in tast not the greatest either  

now for dessertthi is where wick spoon has their one shine moment  it all about dessert here  from present to tast you realli cant go wrong with their dessert their macaron werent that great but everyth els disappear onc it made it to my tabl  

overal i have to give wick spoon just 3 star becaus it just okay compar to the rest of the strip buffet out there for 35 a person for lunch i think i could get more bang for my buck outsid of the strip  im sure i will eventu be back  just rememb im not pay for dinneri was so excit to tri this place becaus of all the press and photo id seen sad i end up be a tad underwhelm 

i love the individu serv as oppos to big messi tray where peopl duel to the death for certain item or use whatev tong they can get a hold of howev there just wasnt enough varieti to make everyon happy

meat lover have ton of entic option such as duck ravioli bone marrow and brais boar ragout seafood lover have less to choos from the menu was veri shrimpheavyshrimp cocktail shrimp cevich spanishstyl garlic shrimp

mayb this is the asian ladi in me but i was wonder the whole time where are the clam mussel calamari fish there were one or two fish dish which were rather cooki cutter and noth excit crab leg were offer so you might be happi if that your thing i never care much for crab leg so i was left want more

vegetarian are even less wellrepres unless you count the salad bar and vegan forget about it

thi allyoucaneat is pretti awesom for peopl who have a sweet tooth ill give it that dessert rang from macaron to strawberri cream puff to a dens chocol cake for me the dessert were the highlight of my dine experi here

w came at dinnertim suppos when buffet put out the best of the best and we were in vega known to be a buffet heaven despit all that i fail to be impress by this newer restaur the wick spoon though it serv some decent not great meat dish with decad ingredi didnt meet my definit of a great buffeta few of us were in town for a work seminar and we decid to pay wick spoon a visit on a monday evening

first of all the trek down the hallway past marque and holstein was kind of a hassl as the buffet was awkward isol at the west end of the cosmo on the 2nd floor after you pass the paint and the overs high heel youll reach the beauti design modern wick spoon

th servic was impecc our waitress constant kept our water glass fill and our tabl was regular reliev of empti plate she explain the layout of the buffet tabl and answer our everi question

i tri the

salmon
crab legs
build your own mac n cheese
sushi
prim rib
pot roast
passionfruit macaron
mint chip gelato
chocol cupcake

sound like a heavi meal doesnt it mani of the dish were serv tapa style and it was a conveni way to serv individu portions

sad to say the sushi was terribl execut the option were spars and the rice was stiff the crab leg were well crab leg they were tini chill and slight sweet the mac n chees station was pretti awesom your abl to custom your own dish so if you didnt enjoy it then it was your own fault i design my mac n chees with green onion bacon parmesan and gruyer delici the prime rib was tender juici and definit one of the highlight of the meal howev the dessert were probabl the star of the show we could not get enough of the 18 differ gelato flavor the gorgeous macaron mini chocol cone massiv chocol dip strawberri browni pud etc but then again we were a tabl of women if we couldnt appreci the gorgeous display of decad dessert who could

dinn was on my boss so i definit cant complain but if they work out a few kink toss in a few dish that the m buffet offer then mayb they would be worthi of 5 starit was definit worth check out this buffet but the wick spoon is overhyp for sure 

it not bad by ani mean i like mani of their dessert and food present i almost want to steal the littl metal milk carton that the cream for my coffe came in p

i came here for brunch on a sunday at around noon it cost about 36 per person which is pretti reason howev they didnt offer mani item that i would have like to see for exampl there were no crab leg nor much sushi option there were mani cheap protein like sausag  veri tough roast beef and the korean marin galbi was not so flavor also all the chines dish were extra salty

i would mayb come back to check out their dinner buffet ive been to wick spoon a coupl of time and while the first visit was spectacular my most recent visit left me unsatisfi  everi vega trip we choos one brunch buffet to visit on our last day  our last two trip we chose the wynn buffet but sinc we were gambl at the cosmopolitan we decid to stay local

25person for a brunch on a friday is total sensibl especi for one of the more high rate buffet  the 15 minut wait was also veri reason for a friday at around 1100am

wick spoon has a wide varieti of food separ by station breakfast omelett biscuit and gravi french toast etc meat italian sausag prime rib bone marrow spanish inspir asian inspir light appet and dessert  the varieti plus the creativ offer in a lot of the dish are much to be admir howev this visit i felt like wick spoon deliv more simplist and stale food  the chocol cover strawberri though omg  so delici  in my opinion the dessert alon are worth the price of the buffet

il probabl skip wick spoon on my next vega trip but will return soon after for a follow up  hope i just came on an off daywick spoon yes it a pretti cool fusioni buffet with a huge select hmmm what can i sayit honest not mediocr they have some fanci stuff like shrimp cevich crab etc but if your tryna od on some fresh oyster shrimp seafoodnot realli the place all the food doesnt seem like it worth 50 i probabl ate until i almost pass out but i fill myself with mayb 20 worth of food they got macaron though my friend and i togo hella hahato use up the 30 i wasnt abl to accomplish with all the chines food and italian food which isnt realli worth that much money i think the buffet at caesar palac is way better
they chang up their menus and sometim they dont have certain stuff so be sure to check

th second time i went i realli didnt get my money worth they kept run out of everyth they had no macaron so goodby 30 they serious had noth but king crab leg which becam tire after a while to crack open

i just dont think wick spoon is worth the money it super fanci schmanci and pretti high qualiti yes but they dont have the big stuff like oyster shrimpetc they had salmon but it was danki and ait 

dessert select is amazingggggg and super well present in their decor but tast wise it was ayeokayi 

good for the whole experi sinc it is in cosmopolitan hotel and it super nice saw matt barn doeee which was pretti cool dwe arriv here for brunch on a saturday afternoon there was no wait to pay for the buffet but we wait about 40 minut to be seat that was somewhat frustrat as you could see empti tabl in the dine room

thi place is hype up by fellow yelper  foodi but i dont know that it the best buffet in vega i would say it on the same level as the wynn and a step below bacchanal

th food isnt bad but it could have been better i wasnt abl to fulli satisfi my intens pigout session becaus person i didnt see that mani food that i want to reach for they had all the basic like meat pasta dessert etc but noth too excitafter hear all this hype on how amaz wick spoon was i was eager to tri it out and after tri it for myself i think the consensus not onli mine but the entir group i had gone with was that wick spoon was just aok a buffet is a buffet and i mayb a had a one item that realli stuck out everyth els was pretti medicor and typic of a vega buffet 

now the decor of the place is nice you do absolut get that fanci feel like i am in a fanci place servic is pretti good also but is servic realli an area of focus when your on at a buffet

pric can get pretti heft dure the holiday 4260 for lunch on holiday not worth it and for dinner which is close to like 50 i think 

advic 1 it is not worth the dinner price i capslock so that it could catch your eye go for lunchbrunch for 27 buck they have breakfast item and lunch item they also have differ station like a salad station the breakfast station the meat station the asian section 

advic 2 if you want to save space in your stomach skip the asian section it whatev 

mi favorit item has got to be the short rib cavatelli holi crap it was good the meat were also pretti delici 

anoth plus they have a gelato station in the dessert station which is pretti coolwhat a cool place and man do i wish i had taken a grandma size purs with extra ziploc and a bigger appetit as neither the husband nor i had seen a buffet quit like this befor 

i have been out of the swing of life for a bit so i havent done ani entertain for much longer than i would like to admit but this place got all of my littl foodi serv gadget and gizmo idea work i love the concept of this placeand though there were plenti of thing serv buffet style most offer came in individu serv size contain or portion mini fryer basket with fri chicken mini take out chines contain with noodl or fri rice cast iron skillet with mac and chees a risotto offer in a small cassoulet dish and the list goe on 

the dessert area was one like i have never seen includ a full gelato station with sever flavor offer the husband imbib in the dessert offer quit a bit but sad i was too full 

sinc we were in vega celebr our 5th anniversari it didnt dawn on me that we would be in town for chines new year and the super bowl due to this there were a lot of veri pretti but not for me type of offer either ingredi or textur wise there were some hit and some definit miss on some of the regular item but this is the genius thing about a buffet thoughlot of offer for all differ tast buds

i will tri this place again in a heartbeat and hope will get to feel a bit more wicki was look forward to tri the newli renam tspot for a tasti bowl of hot pot but it sad didnt meet expect the blueberri boba tea was great the servic alright they had pretti decor  the experi was nice but perhap better suit for a smaller parti of two after figur out the menu  concept we chose a coupl type of meat veggi noodl and two type of broth the meat was lack in flavor bare a differ between the two differ broth and not near spici enough onc cook the portion were small and the bill we receiv near 70 for 3 was too much for so littleth meal left my wallet  my stomach emptiour first night in vega was celebr at twist  have to say there were some hit  some miss  2 of the group got the tast menu  3 of us did a la carte

w were sad to discov the vegetarian menu was actual a vegan  gluten free menu  most of the dish didnt float our boat  just becaus we dont eat meat it doesnt mean we onli want fruit for dessert or no chees  cream  pasta offer for entreesso the tast menu was out for 2 of the 3 veggi  we chose a la carte

beet  mushroom salad  this was cold salad  was pretti tasty

main was the whole tomato stuf w a curri rice  no wow factor  end up give over 34 of my dish to bf

meati bunch in our group got the foie gras w porcini  the foie  shroom were cut in ident chunk  all cook togeth so the flavor could compliment  eye roll from the deliciousness

main includ venison  steak  the portion were extrem small  the venison was overcook although request to be med rare  the steak was dri but expect sinc buddi 1 order it medwell

ther was an intermezzo cours of blue moon foam  roquefort w poach pear that was a major miss  veri littl chees  way too tart  the vegan menu intermezzo was a raspberri sorbet  it was just a standard sorbet

start dinner at 830pm  it was after 1130pm when half of our tabl cri uncl  had to leav  time between dish was excruci long  especi for those of us not enjoy the tast menu  we left befor the dessert cours was serv but were fill in the next day that this was a ginorm cours that was basic 3 whole dessert  there was suppos to be a tast of 6 dessert but we were told that each of the 6 was like 12 of 1 entir dessertmayb we should have stay  

extrem impress wine list  the ambianc was incred  overal we had a great time chat  catch up w the crew so have to say an aok was veri welldeservyou cant realli mess up pho  it noth but meat veggi and broth  then as a custom you add as much lime sprout cilantro hoisin and sriracha you want 

well pho littl saigon pho was neither special nor terribl but it satisfi my pho crave when i need it more better than bad with mayb 2 or 3 other pho place alreadi in the area less then 12 mile a part it doe have pros over the other they seem pretti clean back when ate here a few month ago but i believ they were recent on dirti dine honest ill probabl eat there again if the parti want to eat here whi becaus they have a good varieti of item on their menu besid pho it didnt make me sick price inexpens spacious interior with plenti of tabl and theyll probabl get it correct  the onli thing i didnt like was that theyll keep to the credit card minimum thing

loc right off the 215 and s eastern near chuck e cheesthe secret is that it realli just ok pizza typic greasi undertheheatlamp pizza that tast delici if your drunk but just allright if your sober the flavor are asi for the most part but you can accessor for a price the best part about come here is that it is a secret  no sign or special door just a hallway you feel special just to find it along with the other yeap im gonna say it hipster ipa and pbr are flow as well as wine and soda pinbal machin are in checknot so secret pizza

y there was a line

pizza was good but not mindblow  
the crust is super crunchy
think i prefer more of a rustic style pizza that is a litt more burnt around the edg and slight more chewy

but it was good and veri affordable

b price seem good until they hand hand it to you in a red cup
talk about tini  it was like 8 ounces

definit worth a tri if your stay in the cosmopolitan but id say skip it your come just for the pizzahype hype hype hype hypemor hype

that what i thought about secret pizza at the cosmopolitan mayb im spoil by mani great pizza place in portland so this one just doesnt do anyth for me we had one slice of the white pizza it was just ok it was soooooo greasi 

ye this place is cheap for vega standard and especi for cosmopolitan standard doe it worth it to tri it sure doe it worth to come back again for it probabl notsunday afternoon lobsta fest 

notic the mix review but the gf was hanker for a lobster roll and my go to spot is  closedon sunday

w got 

lobster bisqu  499
lobster roll  16
lobster salad roll  8
lobster mac and chees  16

the good   servic was good  contrari to what ive read   pleasant server time  food was hot  the lobster roll was decent but whi in a tortilla and it might be a littl pricey for the amount of meat

th averag  bisqu had decent flavor a littl on the thick side   mac n chees  start out veri averag but it actual much better later when the sauc harden a littl and the flavor meld

th bad  not necessarili bad  let say below avg  the lobster salad roll  not much lobster flavor go on here 

they have various seafood option that might be worth a tri  will i come back  yeah  ill give it anoth shot

pic attachi first stumbl upon aa bakeri when i was look around desper to find my mom some lo por baang a a gift  after a quick cri for help on my facebook i was direct here  how did i not see this place sooner  

anyway aa bakeri has a wide array of asianstyl pastri bread and cake for sale  their onion bread and custard bun are pretti decent but i dont realli care for anyth els   the wife cake i bought my mom tast odd  grant they had sooo much more flavor than just the tradit wintermelon and stuck everyth in a pretti box but it wasnt flaki like the tradit wife cake  i didnt care much for it at all

whil i dont see myself as a longterm custom to aa bakeri there so mani other asianstyl bakeri in the valley that are better i wouldnt hesit to stop by if im in the area for some hong kong style egg tartconsid the cosmopolitan is the newest resort on the strip it not surpris that near everi aspect of the hotel is so trendi and nice  howev it still pretti surpris that even their 24hour dinercaf look great  definit nicer than some random denni or ihop

unlik the vast major of cosmos restaur and eateri the henri is locat on the ground floor by the entranc closest to the bellagio as oppos to the second and third floor  despit be so close to the casino though it pretti cool how the restaur isnt at all loud or smokey  although there seem to be a decent size crowd wait to be seat it onli took about 1015 minut to get a tabl for brunch on a sunday

whil i normal would have opt for an actual brunch type of dish i decid instead to go with the corn beef reuben with a side of truffl tater tot base on what other had mention on yelp  the dish sound pretti good but to be honest the truffl tater tot was what got me excit  it a combin of two fantast things

a far as portion go the reuben was certain a winner  the sandwich was practic burst open  howev i dont think it tast as amaz as how other have describ  i certain appreci all that meat but the abund of sauerkraut was veri overwhelm think sauerkraut with corn beef rather than corn beef with sauerkraut  convers the tater tot were just as good as i had hope  they could have been a littl crispier but that a minor quibbl  i just wish there had been more

even though the servic was good enough for me to round up from three and a half star im round down specif becaus of price  the reuben wasnt aw at 16 but 500 for a diet coke  that ridicul even by vega standard  next time ill just stick with a cup of water and get my diet coke comp at the tablfriday morn tropicana arrivalremodel and leav old past behindfamiliar trace of past presentbeach cafe and want light bruncha la cart option availablesingl egg over easi threesmal egg and cook pictur perfectrunni yellow a spoonfulcorn beef and hash fivecan or bulk varietya pillow of soft ground corn beef and hashmush consist and chew not requirednot bother for five corn beef and hashstil enjoy the atmospher and servic at the bar dinebeach cafe is your averag runofthemil vega dine spot the whole place has a beachi feel it felt a lot like a place we ate when on our trip to mexico atmospherewis my biggest complaint about the facil is that the chair werent veri comfort and the servic wasnt much better otherwis the whole place is pretti aok 

on night number one our flight was delay and myself and my cowork were starv so we stop here for a quick late night bite i order a chicken quesadilla and he order their miniburg both were just fine for a meal at near 1130 at night 

they offer a breakfast buffet for 21 per person which includ your beverag choic of oj or coffe i ate here a total of 5 time while on my recent busi trip 3 of the 5 time i was there the servic was iffi if your wonder whi we went so oftenconveni it was the onli breakfast place in our hotel and due to time constraint besid starbuck if that even count we were kinda forc to eat here 

the buffet contain sausag bacon muffin minibagel salmon fresh fruit scrambl egg breakfast potato slice meat  chees cereal and my favoritean omelet station 

one day even though i request my omelet well done it was quit under cook and i actual had them remak it on this particular day i feel bad becaus the next day i think the omelet guy was kinda afraid of me he joke about me come back even though he knew he mess up the day befor so we just laugh it off and he did a great job on day 2 

would i go back probabl would not go out of my way but if i was in the hotelmayb i would grab a quick bite to get some food in my tummi precocktailhate to say it but i just didnt love it   there ive said it  after tast the mushroom risotto appet at yelp birthday event i couldnt wait to come to herb box for lunch

th restaur has a nice layout with a dinein area a littl market and a patio in between  we sat insid and start with the market chees board  there was onli one chees select i expect there to be at least two for some reason but it was deliciousbri with a caramellik sauc fig i think  i also had the grill chicken and sage pesto sandwich with goat chees and bacon  it was good but it wasnt an omg this is the best sandwich ive ever had moment  i realli think serv it warm would bring out the flavor  worth 12  i think not  sweet potato chip were a plus

wher they realli lose point with me was servic  not terribl but definit left a lot to be desir  i had to ask for utensil and napkin  also she offer a box for half my sandwich and left the room but came back emptyhand  empti hand empti head

just okay for me  but i might have to have a parti for one cater just to get those appet againthis was just  ok  after hear and read so mani great thing about the herb box i was sure i would realli enjoy it  well no  not so much  especi disappoint becaus my mom was with me dure an alltoobrief visit to az and i realli want to take her somewher great  

we arriv around 130 purpos avoid the lunch rush  i thought this would be a good thing  what we found was a disorgan and distract staff and a lot of unclear tabl  onc we were seat and given menus we were pretti much abandon for a good 10 minut  at last a coupl of glass of water arriv but the waitress disappear again befor we could place our order  she came in and out of the dine area seat other and even take their order but didnt acknowledg us until i was readi to a fold the menu into a paper airplan and aim it at her head and b leav  helloooooooooo

at last we were abl to order  hooray  wait dont get excit yet she didnt enter the order into the termin  oop  when we final receiv our food it was not exact worth wait that long for either  i had the market sunflow salad and my mom had the blacken chicken caesar wrap  while good i dont think either dish warrant the 12 price tag  it is lettuc and chicken peopl  really

y the locat is cute and quaint  yes the ingredi are fresh  perhap if we had a differ waitress i would have been happierwill yelp ever bring us the 12 star i know everyon would use it i had a 35 star experience

w jim w our daughter abbi and i join fellow yelper scott w heather and ryan c and organ aileen b for a brunch uye this morn so the compani was five star

i would give the atmospher and servic five star as well the place has a realli open feel and the patio look veri invit the servic was unobtrus yet attent my water glass never ran empty

th place they lost me was the food i order steak and egg the steak was delici albeit petit the fingerl potato were fine noth to write home about but the egg were not cook right if you cant get my scrambl egg right i order them scrambl light your not go to wow me especi if you charg me 15 for a diminut steak and smatter of overdon egg i thought all the offer a tad pricey which my famili attribut to scottsdal waterfront real estat price but this was the first time i have ever been hungri between brunch and dinner

would i go there again possibl i doubt id go for brunch but the rave over dinner make me curious mayb they could wow me the second time aroundwe went to the herb box to eat lunch over the weekend after do some parooz through old town  this has been on our list of must tri place to dine after read so mani fellow yelper review  it was an awesom start with a few drink listen some fantast live music on the patio

restaur  the patio is the place to eat if avail especi when they have entertain  it a wrap around patio so there are differ option to choos from  the insid is veri nice somewhat of a north eastern coastal design with comfi chair unless your stuck with one of the plain wooden chair i know these plain chair provid more balanc to the decor but they are they are not comfi  

servic  was veri good not except but good  they are veri attent to your drink howev they are not as attent to your meal after it arriv  

food  5 star for fresh  everyth we order was extrem fresh from the salad to the veggi   we order their flatbread with smoke bbq chicken bacon gouda chees organ green slice cherri tomato and onion  it was veri good  the green on top of the flat bread were toss light in oil and were delish  everyth on the flat bread was veri good howev it had too mani cherri tomato halv which were pick off half way through  

we also order the gill kobe feta burger with lot and i mean lot of arugula grill onion with a littl bit of red pepper aioli with a side of sweet potato chip  after pull off some of the arugula so i could see my succul kobe beef patti we dug in  this is a veri tasti burger but the feta chees and aioli were veri spars almost non exist  we had to ask for more aioli sauc twice  the sweet potato chip were veri delish and becam veri addict to everyon at the tabl  we should have order more   

we also order the smoke gouda mac and chees with bread crumb  this was a miss for us sinc it lack the creami cheesi good it should of had but rather it was all pasta with some light shave of gouda chees and bread crumb  it was veri bland and we think there was more bread crumb than chees 

the herb box seem like a veri nice place to dine with friend and famili especi on their patio when they have some entertain  we plan to come back for more sweet potato chip and to tri someth els on their menu  it is aokexpect  realiti  disappointment

whil i still think the servic here is aw 85 of the time the food and atmospher are too good to keep us away i have to updat my review to be fair becaus in all honesti i eat here at least 1 or twice a week for lunch 

food 5 stars
patio 5 stars
servic 0

just lower your expect on the servic so that when you do get someon great you are pleasant surpris 

thing i recommend in the order of how often i order them

sunflow salad my fav salad on the planet
whit bean chili oh gosh they need to do like a soupsaladsandwich combo asap
pesto chicken sandwich w sweet potato chips

that pretti much all i order but i can say that their enchilada are the bomb and so is the quesdilla 

as for the dessert down in the market we have yet to tri someth that wasnt amaz crack pie chocol mouss thing in a mini pie crust cake slicesseri whenev we go for dessert it amaz 

the servic in the market is alwa good tooi notic this place was hot on yelp so i want to check it out im not sure what distinguish new mexican food from the other state so i didnt know what to expect when i order i was told they make everyth fresh from scratch and make their green chile with hatch chile that excit me i get hatch chile everi year and love cook with them for month to come if i had to guess i would say that they boil their chile becaus their green chile wasnt as flavor and tasti as the one i roast 

i order a green chile pork chimichanga i was disappoint with the tortilla definit not made from scratch as i tore into the chimi i realiz they gave me chicken instead of pork no biggi the chicken wasnt cook togeth with the green chile they were cook separ and then combin into the chimi i guess that the new mexican way after i make my green chile i add the meat and let it simmer for an hour to let the meat absorb the flavor of the green chile i was disappoint with my chimi the bean were excel and the rice was alright 

the restaur itself is veri small and i would prefer to take my food to go and eat the comfort of my own home the woman take the order at the regist was veri nice and friend i will come back and tri some other menu item but not the green chileive been here twice alreadi i rememb not like someth about the place last time i came but i couldnt rememb what it was onc we walk in here the other day i was immedi remind 

the waitress just stare at us when we walk in i said do we just seat ourselv she respond well that what the sign say obvious i didnt read the sign if i ask the question but she didnt need to be sarcast about it mayb they should have a record messag that say pleas seat yourself when you walk in the door sinc they get irrit when peopl ask it took us about 15 second to find a tabl and sit becaus i couldnt decid if i want someth by the window a 2 seat tabl or a 4 seat tabl i didnt think that was long at all but when the waitress came up to us with our menus she said wow i didnt realiz find a tabl was so hard then she took our drink order coffe and water the coffe was 155 with unlimit refil when she came back we both order veggi omelet 775 ea

th veggi omelet were averag i just found it weird that they put whole slice of tomato in the center https3media4akyelpcdncombphotoedx3twdngmxq4hxmwgbkjgljpg  the coffe was veri good though and i got about 3 refil 

overal i dont think id come back here even though i live a coupl mile away i just dont like the servic and the food is just mediocr if the waitress was complet quiet the whole time it wouldv been better 

tip
direct go south on buffalo make a left on cactus and when you get to the end itll be on your righti wish i didnt have to take two star away from this place just becaus of their amaz daili oyster special from 245pm600pm ill stick with some stars


servic suck and slow they should have thought about how mani peopl would come to this place when it the freakin three day weekend yes mayb some peopl dont have their day off for veteran day but think about the peopl who doe ugh

cam here with my cowork and we thought itll be nice to eat some daili 1 oyster after eat a small dish the hell with the wait when we order our food the server with short hair that put it in a bun on the side suck at serv us i mean we know it busi but she did not say much about sorri for the wait or what so ever wait 40 min for our food then anoth 40 for our dozen of oyster i look over to the oyster bar onli one person was shuck mayb theyll make more money if they have more than one or two peopl shuck what the freak man more custom  more employe should be work come on now

at the end we let the waitress know we just want half a dozen becaus it take forev she goe on and tell us oh ill go check on them to see if they alreadi put in the dozen or start yet there is a line of order they are work on bare with us were busi today what the freak ladi more like how about you tri to make your custom happi and not wait this long becaus of that cowork alreadi said sorri im leav no tip boy did the cowork made it obvious took the bill to a worker and said bring this to your manag attent got our oyster but didnt get good servic blehreview 365 of 2013

yelp 365 challeng la style  crush and demelished


met up with a few close friend to celebr the gfs birthday ive heard of the place seen it but never had the opportun until now let start with the restaur itself  i thought that the actual restaur is clean and love the ambianc becaus it wasnt pack for a holiday weekend  the menu is just a basic one pager with food on one side and wine on the other  the first thing to catch my eye with pj clark menu is the sticker price  here you get your choic of differ steak lobster fish burger and a few differ appet  the price are a bit high but expect sinc it on the strip and in the forum  this is a chophous and their steak and seafood entre are about what you expect to pay for on the strip  the portion look just about right too  my gripe about the price is on their other food outisd of steak  everyth outsid of their steak were a bit overpr  i wasnt in the mood for steak on this visit so i end up with their cadillac burger over 20  no frill abov averag tast but not worth the price tag in my opinion  we had tater tot calamari and onion string for appet and felt that all three were littl on the salti side  terri r had the lobster mac and i thought it was pretti good but a touch on the salti side too  

servic here wasnt the best from where we were at you can hear the chef yell at that the staff and our server wasnt the most attent  first he took forev to take our order  when our order final came in he just drop off the food without even ask if we need anyth els  yes sir ketchup would be nice with our fri pleas some dip sauc for our onion string would be great  a knife would be perfect with my meal but i guess a butter knife is all i get  i also got an allerg reaction from my dessert my fault  all i need to hinder my nauseous was some cracker  our server was too busi chat with his bud that i had to wave for anoth server to take care of us  the sad partour group was big and the tip was automat ad  that mean that our server got close to 100 for do almost noth overal not the biggest fan of pjs

all is not lost though  i still had a great time with friend and the birthday girl terri r  happi birthday to my gp  if i could rate the restaur base on the great time we all had dure dinner it would be 5 star for sure  

ps  read the reviewsseem like happi hour is the way to go here  mayb i will be back  but for now 3 star is all you get pj clarki know i have friend all over but i didnt realis that i had a friend in pasha until i step through the door the prompt greet from the fellow behind the counter was welcom verg on friend 

seem to ensur absolut no confus on the point of whether or not we were buddi he refer to me no fewer than half a dozen time as my friend dure the ten minut i spent in the shop not bad for never have exchang name right

aft a brief perus of the menu board i opt for a basic donner kebab report they also serv up everyth from burger and chip to pizza to curri quit versatil consid the wee footprint of this takeaway with my meati bounti which bare fit in the styrofoam contain in tow i return to my hotel room to stuff my face befor pass out as one doe after four dram of whiski in one night 

though i cant rave much about the meat it ran a bit on the dri side pasha certain isnt stingi with portion even though my last meal was near twelv hour prior i was still onli abl to get down about half my kebab befor rais my white flag in surrend the combin of fresh toast pita top with shave lamb presum and top off with salad a lone wedg of tomato and a heavi dous of white sauc left me feel satisfi and sleepy

and as if you had to ask what i did with the other half of my kebab it vanish onc the sun came up and tast even better than the night befor wast not want notyelp eat week 2011 50 off take 1

easili a 45 mayb a 5star review but tonight wait time for the entre were too long and the restaur was veri noisi and if there one thing i realli dislik it is dine in a noisi venu  

i estim that we wait at least 10 minut our sausag of the day app chorizo w a side salad that includ pickl onion which was fine assum by the time we sat down and order it was alreadi 815p app photo were taken at 828p but id also place our order for the pansear scallop sub parsnip pure for the corn grit and the tender belli strip steak at the same time as id order the app  these did not arriv until short befor i took photo 857p  andrew person sat us at a tabl but quick oblig our request to move to anoth locat that was a littl less noisi a booth had just open up  nice touch and it was great appreci  howev as the wait time extend longer and longer the nois did get to my mother who was veri hungri and tire  subtract the long wait time and the excess nois im left w friend and accommod yet veri slow servic andrew said id be abl to sub someth els for the cornbas side in all of the yelp eat menu i went w the dessertsweet parsnip pure and fantast food  the strip steak cook medium was not overlyseason and mom was enjoy the meal which was accompani by a gorgonzolacorn spoon bread just like eat bread pud  stonefruit compot apricot and  crunchi pistachio  i love the compot which realli ad to my enjoy of mom entre choic  i also love the scallop entre which consist of three scallop that were around 175 inch in diamet each and sat on the parsnip pure top w saute snow pea green and a gastriqu made w red rock cola  the applewoodsmok bacon lardon tast nutti and had a nutlik mouthfeel as well  my first few bite of scallop and pure were love but then the sweet becam too much sinc the scallop were natur sweet themselv  mom realli enjoy the scallop she didnt have much of the pure much more so than the strip steak  hear her hum w pleasur made me feel so happi    

i would love to visit again but on a lessbusi time it was after all first day of yelp eat 2011  mayb for lunch  i also put in a request to add the bread pud fondu yelper enjoy at the yelp parti held here in februari on the regular menu andrew said that the venu still serv it but on special event  while i was not abl to enjoy the bread pud tonight i intend to visit again befor ye week end i did bump into donjay s who had tri it and said it was good but not as good as the fondu version  this menus version includ bacon i cannot wait to tri it

httpwwwyelpcombizphotosd10ixzpirvjlospdrzjczaselectdfqi2pondyqtnv1435yhqthis place remind me of one of those hipcosmopolitan restaur in manhattan i use to walk by when i was a student at nyu that i couldnt afford i like that look and after feel good about the review decid to join three old friend for dinner

everyon is dead right about the chop salad damn im not a huge salad eater but i could have this one everi day  the perfect starter dish

on to the main cours  i had the truffl grill chees sandwich meh it was ok not great  two of my friend order the filet mignon one love it the other  not so much she said it was ok but they smother it with sauc at 32 im not sure whi youd do that to a perfect good piec of meat  anoth friend had the lamb burger she said it was fine but probabl would order someth els the next time

bottom line  mix review on the main cours  go for the saladla cave is describ as a wind and food hideaway that serv savori small plate and oven fire flatbread you are greet at the front with what seem to be typic for las vega hotel restaurants
can i have a last name
can i have a first name
ar you stay here at the hotel

at first glanc the restaur doesnt seem veri larg there are 3 differ part to the restaur the main dine area the garden loung and the cave in the front room the cave the ceil are low and there is a bar on the left and seat at a long tabl in the center on the right side you can sit by the open kitchen and watch the food be prepar as you eat the back room where we were seat is slight larger with higher ceil and a more open feel there is seat along the side and middl of the room and anoth bar at back the last room which is part outsid is call the garden lounge

aft we were seat our waiter introduc himself and made sure to tell us that the food would be small plate and point to the plate on our tabl to show how larg each item would be appar the peopl that sat down besid us didnt want small plate so they got up and left move on to the food we were given a short overview of the menu told about the chef special for the day and given an extens wine list

w decid to order three things
meatbal marinara bread chef special
sl sirloin steak mushroom fondu cippolini onions
lamb tbone bacon mustard green fresh figs

aft order the food was brought out much faster than i expect it to be i suppos this could have been a bad sign it wasnt although not extravag in ani way the meatbal were my favorit item from the meal the meat was season perfect and the marinara didnt overpow the flavor of the meat also for the price the portion was veri larg the sirloin steak was cook well i mean flavor not that it was burn to a crisp i dont realli like mushroom but in this case they didnt detract from the overal flavor final the lamb tbone this was almost as good as the meatbal  great seasoningflavor and veri tender is how i would describ it the lamb was place over a bed of mustard green with bacon in almost ani situat i hate mustard green not this time though as they were actual good

no room for dessert but ill assum we didnt miss out on anyth special the dessert are standard dessert serv from the hotel wynn and not uniqu to the restaur beyond the food the servic was veri good from the person that show us to our tabl to our waiter to the person go around refil drink there was just enough attent but not too much to the the point of be annoy the next time im in las vega ill definit be go back to la cave to tri out a few more thingwe ate here earlier this month may and i want to wait for a few week to see if my initi reaction would chang in time but it hasnt and i still feel the same to be fair here are a few posit adject that describ the overal time we spent at e creativ friend intim knowledg team work and dedic at the end of the day though shouldnt all restaur have the attribut i just list at the end of the day over rate omg i read all the yelp review below that gave this place 5 star and thought wow this is go to be amaz i cant wait and instead we walk away with woah we paid almost 600 for that what a joke later that night we went to aria where we were stay and order a plate of nacho and fri that was 5 of the cost and much more fulfil 

you may ask what about the experi well if youv never been to a classi restaur paid for 75 for a nice steak had a nice glass of wine or seen the food network then i will say it again over rate yes the staff is amaz coordin top notch and it a fun place to watch the staff at work but id rather go to a cirqu show  there are hundr of restaur in las vega and on the strip and this place would not even hit my top 20 list 

of the 18 dish we had i rememb have one bite of a realli nice piec of steak the funni thing is they actual show us the entir cut grill and we thought shoot what is that 10 oz we can eat that whole thing but instead we got one slice each the freez dri sangria 1st dish was a bit weird but interest  the beet pita with brie chees was differ but not someth id prefer and would rather go to a chees bar

w made reserv a week prior to date we want and were lucki to get in they made it so hard to give the credit card to reserv the time becaus they dont take phone call and dont respond to email on mon and tue mayb they think this process add to their mysteri and exclus it more inconveni and annoy than anyth and who realli care about a golden ticket and piec of paper that say you ate at e not me they ask us to arriv 1530 minut in advanc to our seat and in the end sat us 15 minut after our seat time  when you arriv to the cosmo hotel no sign or anyth to tell you where this dungeon is we had to ask about 4 peopl who work at the hotel and then final found it at the top level in the main jose restaurant

and be prepar to sit in a dark room with random stranger who may get drunk dure dinner with their pair and start have unwant convers with youoh i hate to do this food and drink qualiti is still good 32 has been my favorit spot for awhil now for coffe  now where do i start on my new review i struggl between 2 or 3 star but i am be bias and let them live with the 3 instead

i havent been to 32 in 2 week and decid to stop by and get some drink with my wife when we get there it is all new peopl work there that is a littl depress i will reminisc that the first barista i met here have been hand down my favorit and none have fill the shoe they left

back to my experi i have my loyalti card with one punch left that mean my wife and i onli need to pay for one of our drink yay sound like my day is go pretti well the next event was wait for this girl who was just tinker on the ipad to get done and greet us and get our order we order or drink 

and she say i cant give you your free drink

i was just honest confus and stun so i didnt say anything

girlyou are do this in one purchas right

mey at this point in my head i am thinkingwhat it has never been like thatfor the 3 or so year i have been come here it has never been like that

girlwel you can do it in two transactions

m yeah do that  at this point to prevent me from be over involv in this convers i flip open my phone and wait for her to figur this all out

th girl turn to the person work on the bar and ask some question about the situat yay it the manag work at the bar final a familiar face she was as confus as i was about the situation

girl well i dont want to give them a doubl discount a punch in the card and a free drink


at this point i just space out becaus this is the most ridicul i have heard no where doe that  or act like thatlet alon in front of a custom grant i did not say anyth els and just got my drink and left 

wowi just dont even want to express how sad this is for me that 32 is start to be one of those placei was a littl disappoint i have been ask the organ of my twin mom group to do a night out at this place  final she set the date  my husband was go to be out of town so i had the nanni come sinc i didnt want to miss it this place be my suggest  i got there on time as usual so i was the first one  i ask the ladi insid if we had a spot reserv sinc we were a group and she confirm and told me i would be seat outsid in a minute
i sat down on the bench outsid to wait to be direct to my tabl  five minut later a coupl arriv and went insid  what do you know the server was guid them to a tabl outsid  that was a littl rude but i decid to just walk myself to the tabl  my friend who organ the event got in just then and i had onli one menu for me  the server again said she would be right back  i end up go in and grab anoth menu by the way there were onli 2 other tabl with custom besid our  not realli a happen night it was st patti day after all so peopl where drink somewher els  we order our drink  they are realli good  a few other friend arriv and again we were struggl to get her attent and more menus  one of the ladi end up go insid to order her drink she said the server was rude to her insid also  we order a few bruschetta  mine was pretti good but i wish it would have been a better experiif not for the groupon offer i might never have come to seoul korean grill so i was quit excit to come here with a friend and know that we could slash 30 from the bill and indulg in two meat option sinc ive never been to a korean grill befor i hadnt the slightest of what to do but the help staff and my experienc dinner companion help me out

w order the steak and chicken as our meat and the server fire up our tabl grill and lai out our first batch of meat to grill side item were also brought out in small bowl and each was uniqu and tasty

whil i look forward to return it must be said that this isnt a cheap date sort of place dinner run around 20 per person not crazi expensi hesit to eat at this establish insid the pumpnmunch for a few reason not the least be that it tout it gangster style what the hell doe that even mean they have tini toon charact on their menu how gangster is that

not to mention the fact that the exterior of the gas station is adorn with about 500 obnoxi banner announc such delicaci as the gangster fri 

oh and also becaus it insid a gas station the size of a shoebox

but rocket burger and sub was close when i final got around to eat which is fine sinc those guy probabl spend 80 hour a week bring us qualiti food and myriad of exot soda they deserv to go home at a reason hour

that said i had the gangster fri at eat this sure i felt ridicul order it but i enjoy it crinklecut fri gyro meat and nacho chees the gyro meat was fresh carv and veri flavor 

their menu is pretti small and standard with burger chicken finger and the like but it better food that one would normal find at a gas station and probabl a viabl option if the rocket burger boy have close up shop for the night

also you need to read ryan cs review of said shoebox gas station it is hilari httpwwwyelpcombizpumpnmunchphoenixi stop in here for lunch today join this time by friend shelley m  arlin b  here the long and short of it

  the food they serv here tast great  that one thing isnt it

however

  the first time i came it was freez cold inside

  the second time i came it was roast hot inside

  this time it was freez cold inside

  the servic wasnt as friend this time as dure my previous visits

  our food all arriv on one tray  it was up to us to tri to figur out what was what

  they usual give each diner a littl tray of cook onion pepper plus lemon  lime slice but this time we onli receiv two of these tray for the three of us     

the temperatur should be control better in here  it import for the counter  tabl servic to remain friend as it was before

mi order this time was for

carn asada beef taco  125
al pastor pork taco  125
pescado fish taco  2
beef tamal  2i was realli excit about this food truck  the concept is definit uniqu and who wouldnt like a bun stuf with mac and chees  the staff is realli nice and i realli like the side  the truffl tater tot are to die for and the frisco garlic fri are also great  but the bun are pretti bland

i came to the grand open at costco and ive tri to visit everi time they are at costco so i could tri all the bun  ive tri everyth except the sloppi bun a bun stuf with spaghetti which i am eager to tri but theyv been out

th pork special now call hot pig is ok but not spici  

dad picadilli is interest but not veri tasti  like taco meat with some veget in it  there is dill in the bun but i couldnt realli tast it

mac and chees bun now mccheesi i think is mac and chees in a bun  there is suppos to be mushroom andor truffl in the bun but i could not tast either  but the second time i tri it i got more truffl flavor in the mac and chees but i think i built this one up too much in my head and it just disappoint me in the end

bbq rib bun was ok  there is cilantro in the bun but i cant realli tast it

th bacon bird bun is probabl my favorit so far  nice bacon flavor and veri creami  but again not get much flavor from the bun

i also tri the me fri but they are a littl overwhelm with the egg  i could not finish it all  ill probabl stick with the frisco fries

th dessert potstick are super sweet  so sweet they hurt my teeth somehow  unfortun i just cant deal with the sweet but ive onli tri the smore potstick which are fri pastri potstick stuf with chocol and cover with condens milk and graham cracker mayb other are less sweet  you can tri all three if you order the happi end  cute

thi is the onli food truck ive encount anywher that doe not includ tax in the price  so bring chang or expect to get a lot back  3 bun are 6 without tax but 649 with tax if that helps

that be said it a new truck and has a lot of potenti  it look like they are chang up the menu and make new item  so ill like be back for the sloppi bun and other menu item if someth strike my fanci ill definit rereviewthis is a tricki one ab is a realli cool look spot realli nice decor and ambianc comfi booth it even smell like a new car

mi group was greet prompt by smile host and seat in a nice booth drink order were place and when our margarita arriv they were realli realli off and tast terribl even after stir and think posit thought they just were off not sweet enough and didnt tast good our server was cool and he swap them out for other stuff my replac drink was a polish fizz and it was perfect high recommended

for an app we went with the pretzel fondu thank to yelper who recommend it as advertis it was delici and i recommend it for lunch i had the fish and chip and my friend had some salad the fish and chip were veri tasti but the price point for the portion i got just didnt comput three piec of fish think chicken tender size and a small portion of fri along with a small side of over vinegar cole slaw again the food was good but you definit dont get what you pay for i understand the concept of smaller portion euro style etc but for a bar food stapl i wasnt look for a costco serv of anyth but either bump up portion size or drop the price from 16 to 1150

i realli like our server but for some reason as thing went on he was more and more absent to be fair we had a realli difficult person that join us some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out so i feel his pain

anyway ab is a veri attract spot that might be great for drink and app but for this price point i would hit durant hillston or beckett tabl it nice to leav a spot feel that you got your moni worth and that just doesnt happen herei dine at the arrog butcher last night while a sun game was in progress the place was pack on a saturday night and you could definit feel the vibranc and energi throughout the restaur i was with a group of about 10 peopl and we had a great time convers our servic was spot on and water glass continu filled

i love the round dunkin donut size pretzel nugget as an appet i order the swordfish 23 for my entre the fish filet was about the size of my fist so im think it was about 6 ounc it was accompani by artichok creameri barley crush chile and lemon the swordfish was just ok for me i have had better oh how i miss crab  things

i will return to sampl some other item on the menu im guess swordfish is not their specialtiscale of 110 multipl visits

cityscap is deserv notori for realli shitti design with regard to it lack of integr with the rest of downtown but the arrog butcher portion of it is pretti spectacular in how it make love to the corner for all pedestrian to gape at

and i realli like the interior environ of ab too  the servic is also realli crisp

everyth ive order has been averagetoveri good but the menu doesnt excit me much  which could veri well just be a matter of tast  dish that i have particular enjoy though are the italian grinder sandwich and the pretzel fondu which i love love love

in my experi the drink read better than they actual tast but i am a big fan of the streetfight which isnt on the menu anymor but i hope they can still make it next time im in

to sum it all up i definit enjoy arrog butcher but usual onli when i find myself nearbi112912

35 star first visit

bookmark this place month ago and i final had an excus to make the trip from north scottsdal im take mom and aunt to see cirqu du soleil dralion at the us airway center  thank to friend and fellow yelper dolor gs help info on where to park i made the decis to choos cityscap for both the chanc to dine at the arrog butcher and have my ticket valid and take advantag of it proxim to the arena  she wasnt kid when she said that us airway was across the street  after wait about 20 or so minut for first avail we were seat outsid and my view were of the fourway intersect pedestrian traffic and of the front of the arena which were love given that most of my dine experi have been in strip mall old town scottsdal the biltmor suburbia  

i was abl to sampl a coupl of red befor settl with a nice glass of sebastiani cab from sonoma  while wait for our tabl we all decid wed tri the artichok hummus app httpwwwyelpcombizphotosynph5so7wr8hppvcdpbxqselectpmvwrf4yh3y8ga7yx4nfqpmvwrf4yh3y8ga7yx4nfq the market salad httpwwwyelpcombizphotosynph5so7wr8hppvcdpbxqselectp8euqv1jrwi3dhs6f8qw8qp8euqv1jrwi3dhs6f8qw8q the beef short rib stew httpwwwyelpcombizphotosynph5so7wr8hppvcdpbxqselectm50fqaft6npxoxsrjgaqam50fqaft6npxoxsrjgaqa and the fish and chip  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosynph5so7wr8hppvcdpbxqselectaassauxck3kuofcythaaassauxck3kuofcytha

w all love the artichok hummus and pita bread app  the bread was soft yet had a nice chew in spite of it not be warm and crispi  the artichok had great flavor especi those that were touch the tomato  we also ador the market salad which had so mani textur to delight the mouth mix grain chewi cranberri sweet and crunchi gingersnap and creami ricotta mmmm  love the almostnutti bite of the roast butternut squash  i plan to order this again on my next visit  

we also realli like the beef short rib stew i like the smoki flavor of the beef and the green chile pepper but my favorit were the bean  some were still chunki while the other had tender down to almost like a dip you spread on cracker and crostini  i didnt think the fri egg presenc made much of a differ  i could take it or leav it  sinc i couldnt sampl the cornbread muffin allergi i had some of the fri from the fish entre with the stew instead  mom and aunt enjoy the crispi fish  i realli love the batter which was just the perfect amount to cover the fish and give it a veri delight crunch and was the dish ever so pretti to look at  howev i found the piec to be veri salti and i couldnt stand more than two or three bite of it  

i think my mom would veri much like to return and so would i    i am go to tri to make it here earlier for happi hour soon  i realli appreci the locat of cityscap it park garag and it easi access to mani restaur shop and entertain venue go cafe is locat in the renaiss hotel and their greek yogurt parfait is pretti goodtop with sweet and crunchi granola good candi pistachio and fresh fruit unfortun the line can realli build here due to it small size and kitchen and the price are high but that is kind of the case with food in las vegas

lik most hotel in las vega the renaiss hotel offer both valet and self parkmeh i 
total neutral is how i left kitchen 56  we arriv with reserv and were prompt sat at a high top tabl in the middl of the restaur i was surpris to see it was pretti busi for 8pm on a friday  our server greet us veri briefli and took hotti drink order i want to look over the menu and then left he seem pretti frazzl  about 5 minut later our drink were drop off by someon els who did not ask if we need anyth  anoth 5 minut pass and a femal server come to our tabl and ask if we are readi to order no hi my name is let me tell you about the menu noth  i told her i would like to order a drink and she seem annoy like i was be rude  she took my drink order and our appet order and left  

we start with the onion straw a littl greasi but overal pretti tasti especi becaus the sauc was fantast  for my cocktail i had a mapl manhattan which was so delici one of the best manhattan ive had  

 for dinner i order their tofu and veget stir fri with soba noodl this had receiv good review from fellow yelper so i was excit to tri it  i was great disappoint the noodl were over cook it had no flavor except ginger and there were no veget in it except red cabbag  i never send anyth back but i did this of cours took about 10 minut becaus our server never came back to check on us i flag down a manag and she suggest the green chili macaroni  by the time this came out hotti had alreadi finish his meal and his plate had been taken this kind of kill the dine experi  when the macaroni came out it was much better great flavor and just the right amount of creami and spice again the noodl were a littl over cook they were break apart but still edibl 

overal the servic was pretti poor but be a former server i could tell that they were all in the weed so i gave her a break and still left a 30 tip  the food was good but not great  i think i would tri kitchen 56 again under the right circumst but with so mani other option in the area it wont be anytim soonwe call ahead for faster seat and it definit help the wait was consider less than egg work up the street the food and servic were both pretti good i wouldnt recommend the bloodi mari though they were horribl basic bad tomato juic and a lime  they are realli cheap but still not realli worth it  orang juic wasnt realli anyth to cheer about either 

mi pacif scrambl was good and i also enjoy the gluten free pancak the bf like his corn beef hash  our server was mark and he was veri attent

umami is hidden away in a littl hous right off of willi street  the sign is veri small and you can easili miss it but it locat pretti much across from plan b

they sell ramen and dumpl just like the name suggest  we end up order 2 type 12 for a bowl of tonkatsu ramen and 10 for the miso ramen  we also order the pork and chive dumpl 6 for 6  now ramen price are usual pricey like this so we didnt think too much of it

w receiv the dumpl first they were small pan friend on the outsid and came with a soyging dip sauc  these dumpl were tasti but i wish there was more to it  more meat more chive more anything

th ramen came next  this was mayb 30 minut after we receiv the dumpl with that said the servic there was reallllllll slow  for a place that onli sell ramen youd expect to get your food a littl faster  the ramen tast good but like the dumpl there wasnt much to it  you got half an egg a coupl piec of chasu pork and some of the pickl bamboo shoot  i wouldnt say im a gluten but i wish there was more food especi sinc it was a 4560 min wait sinc we made our orderi was hungri 

overal veri good food but not necessarili for the price  you can add extra ingredi to you noodl but that would make a bowl of noodl cost upward of 20 someth im not will to paypoint for be a rehab home but that where most of the excit stop staff has never been all to welcomingfriendlywarmsuggestionori and honest up and down willi i can get some pretti mean dumpl at a number of place their bun are tasti though ill give them that but i just dont think it worth the trip for one specialti itemdrop by for a drink on 331 endedup stay for dinner

our light meal one appet split an order of dumpl and split an order of ramen sorbet plus a few drink all dure happi hour cost 81 with tip that a tad outrag in my opinion im still not sure how it all addedup to be so expens  i hate be nickleanddim by place 

for comparison my last dinner at forequart was 74 with tip and we had a much better meal and experi7611

arriv earli for the oye parti at bld so i decid to check out their happi hour  it a good thing i did too bec the margarita i had here price 3 on the menu card but i was charg 350 httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbldchandlerselectihx38oezn6kqer2aw8ytqihx38oezn6kqer2aw8ytq was one of the beverag highlight of the even  the meatbal mac n chees howev need a tweak while i enjoy the mac n chees portion of the dish i found the meatbal and sauc to be too acid httpwwwyelpcombizphotosbldchandlerselectufsik9g6mzxbgvezredaufsik9g6mzxbgvezreda  if i wasnt tri to slow down my bodi absorpt of alcohol id just gotten a massag befor too so circul was revv up i wouldnt have eaten as much as did and i left more than half in the bowl

stil what i had tri was enough to keep my mind open for more happi hour adventur here  take a look at the interest hh food menuwaffl infus with bacon bit omg they are the best i will say they are a bit pricey at 800 for 1 waffl but a girl got to have her bacon they also make their own margarita and they are on tap whoaaa they are fantastic

head this week for yelp eat new updat thenwe have stop in twice in the last month a nice littl friend place we enjoy the spring roll they were veri flavor some restaur serv them bland these were fresh and tasti we order sandwich to go and request a slight chang to the recip that was meet with a pleasant attitud the sandwich were veri nice bread was great as were the fill 
we will come in again and tri some other item 
i do wonder whi the owner is offend by the 3 star rate i reserv the four and five star for when my sox are realli knock off and am suspici of place that have all 4 and 5 star the first rule of yelp for owner is not to be compatit to the yelper all review are help good and badthis place was definit aok as the three star impli  if yelp allow me to give half star id even give em 35 stars

th pros
th locat  right across the street from the bellagio  so get a good seat and you get to see the fountain go offand im a sucker for a good dinner view
th salad  my caesar salad was light and refresh and not drench in dress  
the portion  definit look like goldilockss portionsnot too much not too littl i think just right for the money  
the servic  our server was prompt and friend and seem eager to help us out 
the ambianc  it remind me so much of a place we have here in pasadena in term of decor call pop champagn bar  kind of hip romanticgoth dark candl everywher etc 
the varieti of dessert and milkshak and fanci drink  need to give in to that sweet tooth of your it seem like endless possibl were avail for that sort of thing   milkshak galore
th fact that the sugar factori candi store is just across the way  so you can realli indulg that sweet tooth of yours

th cons
th theme of the restaur seem realli at a discord with the food of the restaur  i mean it an american brasseri  
mi soup  my french onion soup which i usual am a big fan of was realli salti and all the chees was goop up at the bottom instead of be nice melt and toast at the top  it still was goodbut for me definit not good enough to finish my littl cup portion 
the reminiscentofcheesecakefactori feel  while the ambianc was pretti everyth about the place decor bookstyl menu an unfocus menumad me feel like i was at the cheesecak factori eh not my favorit of restaur 
the salad yeah i know this was abov in the pros section and i stand by the fact that my caesar was pretti good  i just wish the salad was a bit crisper

al in all it one of those place you come becaus it thereor you need to entertain your children by send em over to indulg in the sugar side while you tri to enjoy yourself in the brasseri side  probabl wont be crave this place but wouldnt be against come here againso here are the highlights
 this place is open 247
 they have an expans and interest cocktail menu inspir by your most favorit sweet candies
 the terrac seat has a great view of the bellagio fountain and the strip for peopl watching

w had a late dinner here after watch a show and the huzbeau and i share a french dip sammi which our server kind split into separ plate  it came with fri that were nice and crispi and the sammi was not bad
httpwwwyelpcombizphotos8q6jl7ow8dzzwanggdspcwselectdtglnys7gzszdorvzswq

also share the french onion soup  more notabl than the sandwich i rememb the crouton and broth tast pretti good
httpwwwyelpcombizphotos8q6jl7ow8dzzwanggdspcwselectqrbqjav0an9ke9swacqbw

th coupl that was with us share their banana split waffl which they enjoyed
httpwwwyelpcombizphotos8q6jl7ow8dzzwanggdspcwselectp5br39xhobqfhqconlyf3g  

i had a bubbl gum cocktail which was pretti to look at but not as strong as it was pricey httpwwwyelpcombizphotos8q6jl7ow8dzzwanggdspcwuserid6bxmdkuxglidvrf08ekjg

nic dark decor and fit to be part of the beauti pari hotel  but you know what  i dont know what it is but im not exact pine to come back  just aok for mestill on my quest for the best bubbl tea in town i decid to check out this place which is realli close to my cribbi ive been here for a few visit and i believ that a three star review is appropri 

it a small spot but has pretti much everyth you need i like the fact that they offer food item as well such as ramen and popcorn chicken i did not have a chanc to tri ani of the savori item but will consid it in the future

they use real fruit in their smoothi ive had the avocado and can say that it pretti good the price are more on the steep side

larg milk tea with boba and egg pud  it was pricey at 623 i thought the tea flavor was ok but a littl bit lite the boba was too soft and mushi the same goe for the egg pud even though the textur was off for the both of them i thought they tast ok 

would i want to return here i dont know the price are too stiff for mediocr boba and egg pud ill keep look tyvmi realli want to love this place but unfortun i wont be returning

th custom servic is stellar i cant stress this enough they went abov and beyond to accommod and did so with a smile fat tip for them

th outsid patio is great especi dure this time of the year it spacious and a delight for peopl who like to look at someth other than a wall as you can see all of westgat from their patio

food and drink this is where they lost me pizza has absolut no flavor mozzarella stick had no chees on the insid wing were decent but noth special they dont serv margarita becaus there no blender i thought that was interest 

the bill came out to 75 for one pizza wing and a sampler it just wasnt worth itexcit soon turn to disappoint after the first bite  everyth we tri seem more middl of the road flavor and we tri a lot of stuff  perhap im compar the wow factor that i get from ichiza but kyara isnt there yet  the onli wow item were actual the two desserts

what we ate
1  daikon salad  visual appeal but just tast like it was dunk in regular soy sauce
2  maguro and ume madai sashimi  not so fresh
3maguro yukk  tasti becaus it was slather with spici ponzu concoction
4  albacor wdrew special  similar dish from what nake fish has to offer over there  it has ponzu and jalapeno  one of the better tast dish but onli becaus you cant go wrong with ponzu
5  sunomono abalon sashimi  fresh but bad choic on our part  abalon sashimi is kinda crunchi hmmmm
6  gyutan beef tongu  just a tad too salty
7  beef tataki  ponzu sauc to save the day again
8  spici tuna and rice cracker  enjoy crunchi textur with spicysweet tuna
9  dashi maki tamago yaki  sweet egg omelet meh
10  age nasu  fri eggplant meh
11  deep fri skewer fish  fluffi fish but im not sure about the chees imbed with it

dessert wowsers
1  vanilla tofu mouss  the tofu was so smooth and creami and wasnt too sweet  perfect compliment with the raspberri sorbet
2  chocol fondant aka chocol souffl  the server fail to mention dure the meal that this particular dessert take 1015 minut to make  definit rememb to order befor your done with your main meal if you dont want to wait   but worth the wait  this rival the best souffl out there   ooey gooey warm and sweet

conclus  through so mani dish i couldnt help but feel that there was someth miss  i wont give up yet kyara  i know that your tri to break out and do someth differ than your sister nake fish  i hope you shine soonwas on my way to a friend hous and stop for a quick bite to eat  ordered

they were fast accur and the food was decent  it a taco bell what would you expect

return factor  15my boyfriend and i have been order deliveri pizza and wing from here for about 5 month the food is great but their servic is aw we either are miss extra we request or it take 60 min for the food to arriv they are appx a 12 mile away from us i gotta say if we didnt like their pizza so much we would have dismiss this place a long time ago wrote this about  month ago

upd order pizza and wing from them a week or two ago and the deliveri guy show up 2 hour after the pizza was order after i had alreadi spoken to the manag and he had offer to make a new pizza and wing if i came to pick it up he also said they would credit my account 20 so the next time we got pizza and wing it would be free 

today attempt to redeem my free pizza and wing and they guy on the phone said that we had a credit for 25 off our next order i explain to him the situat and ask to speak to a manag he said he would call me back when he did he offer a 15 minimum deliveri and anyth addit would be on us horribl custom servic im not sure if they just have veri consist turnov or what but we are done tri to justifi the food vs the servic i hope the owner read this and doe some serious hire so disappointcoffe caramel latt was good the servic by the girl at the regist was just plain aw the girl seem annoy special when i mention the 10 discount with  my check with yelp 
she couldnt believ it so i show her my phone and she said she didnt know what yelp was 
 that was insan dumb as she had a small sticker post right next to the regist that read check us out on yelp gosh 
bad day perhap  
oh well i still decid to give this place three tres troi tre star for it awesom vibe like the wall art and it sneaki location
 other than the bad servic that day it seem like a pretti legit coffe spot for those close to it 

 might never come back honest it wouldnt be vega if there werent ani place like this  a great place to find some souvenir or gag or not so gag gift for your friend like

and moreafter read all the wonder highrat review i bookmark this spot as our final cheat meal for our stay in vega dure the olympia 2011 weekend hmphit was not the best idea and here are the reason why

1 when we got there around 745pm saturday night the place was packedand i mean pack as in it super small and doesnt have much seat avail so when you includ the ayc option i can tell whi the wait here is alway long we wait for over 45 minut befor a tabl final decid to get their bootay up and leav even though the waitress was kind enough to offer the 3 of us seat at the bar we opt to get a regular tabl and let the bar be avail for the couplessingles

2 the ayc menu is quit confus you cant have everyth allyoucaneatmeh there were certain item on there were you were onli allow one order per person so the math did get confus for me im no bueno with number here people

3 food the pork belli that everyon rave about was meh for me the sushi roll were also aok noth too crazi besid the nutso 911 roll we order that habanero sauc they use on that roll had my mouth feelin like angelina joli for a good 12 hour omg the sashimi and fresh fish was veri fresh inde and those order alway came out the quickest the chicken skewer werewhat they were just chicken skewer with teriyaki sauc all ova em againnoth special there the onli thing i realli did enjoy was the ayc option of dessert mmmm mmm bombalic i had 2 of the green tea creme brule which were sooooo decad and perfect and 1 red bean ice cream how can you go wrong with anyth that has bean in it yes im asian and i love my beani dessert p

4 servic it got kinda confus who our server was there were some dude that would come out with our order but didnt take our order and then we had about 3 waiter that did take our order back  forth major minus food came out way too slowmomo i know there are onli about 3 chef work but the place is tini and ive been to plenti ayc sushi spot and never had to wait about 15 min between each order im alway hungri especi now sinc im still in precontest season for my fit competit so if im look forward to a cheat meal it better be top notch and the food better come out fast sushi hous goyemon did not do this job well

would i come back for the dessert yes but even that not realli worth the trip there

p we had to hit up jean philipp patisseri at the aria sinc it the onli thing open super late and close to our hotel right after we left this spot cuz my ass was still hungri as effafter the epic meal in the tatami room host by toni t see my review for the event eric r bug me to return here for dinner  we arriv on saturday around 7 and were seat immedi at the bar  the ayc is an amaz deal as it includ the special on the daili special board grill item salad roll nigiri and all sort of other things

som of the new thing i tri includ the grill tofu which was quit tasti and amaebi shrimp head miso soup  the shrimp were a bit harder to eat sinc they were not fri but the flavor of them in the broth was good  the mackerel was cure wonderfully

sinc we were at the bar we had a nice view of the crazi action here  we were taken care of by 4 differ sushi chef and it took me awhil to even start a convers with chef jun a real japanes chef yay in front of us

howev the biggest disappoint is the rice  sushi is all about the rice  the volum of this restaur is huge becaus of the crowd and the rice is not accept for sushi rice  first of all it was hot  i am talk just made no coolingfan and hard ani vinegarseason  hot rice with ice cold fish tast bizzaroooo  it ruin the meal  i notic the first time we ate here that the nigiri slice were all out of whack  becaus of the volum the slice are not cut with precis but with speed  i watch the chef cut awkward nigiri slice that bare cover the hot rice  

eric r ask chef jun about the rice  he said they have such a demand that they just use hot rice and he apolog becaus he know it is just like sushi faux pas 101most sushi restaur i have been to make rice in advanc  as someon who learn how to make the rice from a local japanes market recent i know that it requir 45 minut to an hour of fan and cool prior to serv and that is for my small batch 3 cup at a time  though there is a lot of varieti and i have no complaint about the servic or qualiti i could never enjoy hot rice touch cold uni or cold amaebi or cold hamachiyou get the ideai have to updat with a star lost unfortun 

the last few time havent been as good as befor i think they are suffer from grow pain and staff chang i do not see my favorit sushi guy and i know one in particular doe not work here anymor while the food is still made right and the cut were decent it lost that person familiar charm and the new guy didnt make an effort to realli talk it was busi so fair point that they may not have had the opportun so mayb someth will chang again with time

th big thing for us was the rice has been too warm on visit of late last time it was affect the fish that it was not appet while i get they are busi they should have someon make and proper cool rice throughout it happen twice at a busi but not line out the door rush time the second time sever chang out love for this place 

we will probabl come dure a off time again and see what happen i still thought the fish was fresh i like the rotat special and the mani delici dessert option  as of right now the chang has made this spot suffer a bit for me so itll be a while until we are back im hope in that time they figur out how to deal with their popular and adjust the way they do thing to keep a standardim afraid to even write this review everybodi seem to absolut ador this place ive heard a lot about it everyon rant and rave about how good it is everytim i tri to come here there is alway a wait and hb and i are not about that life 
so we came for lunch hb got a cucumb roll and love it 
i order edamam steam shumai seawe salad tuna poke and yellow tail tuna salmoon and fresh scallop nigiri 
i was far from impress by their tuna poke amando s can make it better at home the edamam was crisp and good the shumai was plain  i think i ate like one piec the seawe salad was good aaaaaand the nigiri it was okay the tuna seem a littl fishier than i normal experi howev the scallop was quit good the scallop is so hit or miss depend where you are at and they serv it veri well here so that was definit a good thing 
i just dont know what all the hype is about it was good dont get me wrong but my mind was not blownwhen i first move to vega my famili and i constant went to sushimon then when we move away goyemon open so whenev i visit vega i alway had to go to goyemon it was amaz it was probabl my favorit ayc sushi place in vega 

the sushi was yummi they alway have some type of special on the board and they have other thing on the menu for nonsushi eater so if you were to come with a huge group of peopl you can get a mix of thing 

one of my favorit item from goyemon has to be the salmon belli it is delici fatti and never a disappoint whenev i get it so whi in heaven name did i give it 3 star well  let me tell you a story

goyemon had their 3rd anniversari custom appreci event and it was suppos to last 2 day they had a list of special item for those day which includ blue fin and toro with that they offer the abil for you to make reserv my friend and i decid to make a reserv for the 2nd day of the event sinc the 1st day of the event didnt work out with our schedul 

the excit built up even more after we found out that on the first day of the event they did ayc toro and ayc uni omg like i cant even wait 

so when we went in for our reserv my excit turn a littl bit sour whi well we had our reserv for 730 pm we get there a littl bit earli but we have to wait for a tabl im sorri  i thought i had a reserv so what we find out is  they are still accept walk in and becaus theyr typic a walk in restaur they dont quit grasp the reserv concept down that well we actual didnt get seat until mayb at 8 pm

and then they tell us that there is no ayc toro tonight onli ayc uni and waygu beef well gee thank what the point of have a reserv then whi would you give ayc toro one night and not the other night i want to flip multipl tabl but sinc we wait for the tabl sat down and were readi to order we just stay 

so my experi from that is just realli realli sour so i learn to just walk in on the day they have yummi special that way i wont be miss out regardless of what they say 

so goyemon get an averag from me i still like them and will continu to go to them for ayc sushi servic can be slow sometim though and the server will look at you funni when you order 20 order of one thing 

oh and love their yuzu sorbet came in for lunch on a hot weekday im not a big fan of ayc sushi but sushi hous goyemon also offer lunch special park was easi to locat i arriv after the lunch hour began and the place was near capac for lunch

i opt for the lunch sashimi special which was reason price and includ miso soup rice and salad the qualiti of sashimi was unfortun aok with the except of the salmon which was the tastiest and end my meal with a generous portion of green tea ice cream 

anoth con was the spotti servic  i had to flag down the waitress for assist and also request dessert not sure if they were have a off day here but i probabl wouldnt return here againoh windsor how i want to love you with postino be one of my favorit restaur ever i had high hope for windsor 

it feel well like postino but not as good 

the patio is comfort it was a perfect even so that made it super nice and the chair are cute but it kind of plain again like postino but without that extra someth special although the perimet fenc is cool with the differ width of wood 

for starter we got the fondu which was good just good the chees  although pipe hot  was kind of gritti which happen with pure cheddar mayb mix someth creamier in there

i got the chicken sandwich with a side of mac n chees the mac was yummi the chicken sandwich was bland and i love me a chicken sandwich even of the plain ole breastbunlettucetomatomayo varieti 

boyfriend and boyfriend mom got the halibut sammich which we had heard was bomb again good not great disappoint for a postino affili kale salad was fine coleslaw was fine noth knock our sock off

our servic was initi realli slow we didnt get notic for a while and then our drink took age everyth after that was right on key and our waitress was well inform and friend 

mi favorit part of the meal was my cocktail  the no 89 it was the perfect blend of strong and refresh i would definit be back for beverag id realli like to tri the wine on tap as well

al in all it kind of seem like they built windsor for all the postino overflow hey your wait is go to be an hour but if you go right across the street there is a postino jr consol prize

il definit give it anoth go after theyv had some time to get settl but until then ill be back for drink and eat elsewherthere are veri few bagel shop in the old town area other than this einstein and a coupl of other  so everi now and then ill pop into this locat to pick up some bagel for the hous they happen to have tasti schmear aka cream chees flavor and qualiti lox as well

unfortun the last few time ive been to this locat the servic has been pain slow  also they are often out of certain kind of bagel that i like includ the honey whole wheat  

on the bright side they will slice the bagel for you andor put them in plastic bag to keep them fresh  their coffe isnt bad and this locat has a decent size park lot too and if you need ani groceri you can run next door to trader joe or around the corner to aj without move your car

if you have the time and dont mind drive a tad bit further i recommend both chompi and ny bagel and biali over einstein but if your expect are in check andor your in a hurri this einstein will do  just keep in mind that it a chain the servic may be slow and while the food wont blow you away it is pretti consistnot have had ani asian buffet for a long two day i whip in here for lunch today  welcom to the place yelp call ez buffet but the owner call altern ez buffet ez chines buffet  easi buffet depend upon which sign or print matter of their you are view  in ani event here goes

thi mediumlarg place was offer up 75 main food item today featur such strict chines dish as clam chowder beef roast stuf bell pepper calzon pizza  pink marshmallow  who knew     

ok this somewhat stylish comfort place with a friend staff was also serv mani of the usual chines treat includ sushi whoop that japanes kim chee whoop that korean egg foo young there    made the real way  lot of what we usual see includ fri chicken boneless spare rib stuf mushroom more chicken fix all differ way fish shrimp  so on end up with a good select of dessert includ tasti real ice cream

it a high 3 star for this nice restaur where the lunch buffet is 675608 sr on monday through saturday 875788 sunday  they also offer a regular menu     this is one of those updat review where im drop the rate but will still continu to pay a visit  i origin gave this teriyaki mad 4 star becaus it was clean and the servic was great  well my last two visit have chang my rate  the main issuetheir servic  the servic at this locat has diminish in the last coupl of month  i dont know if it under a new manag or new associ but the wait is way too long for a side of chicken breast about 20 minut  for a place known for their chicken breast bowl youd think that this order will take less 10 minut  i could understand if i got someth rare like their salmon brown rice or even their katsu  obvious i was a littl disappoint with how long my order took  it also doesnt help that i stood at the regist for about 5 minut befor my order was even taken  

regard their food the salmon and white meat chicken breast is pretti good  i get them plain without sauc so theyr pretti much bland  but it sure beat have to light up the grill and cook the food myself  both choic are healthi and a good suppli of protein  if your carb up the brown rice is a good addit  one item that i would suggest you stay away from is their katsu  your not suppos to go to tmad for their katsu anyway but i was dare and have tri it a few time  it too greasi and doesnt tast anywher near the local hawaiian joint in town  

will i come back  i got no choic if im in the area and crave teriyaki madwell i am a thrifti connoisseur so perhap that whi i was disappoint this is inde a thrifti ice cream counter  but to be clear it insid a gas station minimart

they had a few of the flavor i rememb thank my chocol malt crunch was there but im confus becaus i hate to say butit wasnt quit as good as the stuff i had a few month back in cali at a proper rite aid former thrifti counter

i did get a dish instead of my belov cake cone as i was drive and thought thatd be safer with the drip and chose of cours the cmc as previous mention as well as a scoop of the cherri vanilla the cherri vanilla tast like i rememb and sinc i havent had that sinc oh let say a looooonnnngggg time ago it didnt disappoint

but the cmc well it was okay the ingredi were there but somehow it wasnt as chocolati or as malti as the last one  i have to imagin this is made local rather than ship in but mayb im wrong either way it was not quit as good

th onli other downsid for me was the lack of the same kind of cylind scoop that thrifti had rite aid still has them but this was just a regular scoopi dont dunk my donutsdo you dunk your doe anyon  probabl notweird name and weirder if true  the greas float on top of the coffe and look gross to me  anyway i spent some year in virginia beach va where dunk donut and krispi kreme  are deep fri food icon kk was good especi hot but otherwis tast the same no matter what flavor  the varieti about 25 type and fresh of dunkin donut there made them my favorit they use to sell about 67 type of fill donut aloneblueberri lemon appl boston cream strawberri cherri and chocol etc etc but that was then and this is now 

i come to this dunkin donut everi time im in town visit relat  usual everi month or so  when they open about two year ago they had a decent varieti  but now the select of donut has been reduc becaus theyv ad sandwich and bagel  and i honest have gotten some donut that werent that fresh  sometim ive seen them bring a new batch of donut from the kitchen to the front and that often what i order  i dont like that you cant see them make the donut like you can at most mom and pop shop and krispi kreme  they dont sell turnov but there is plenti of employe turnov  i never see the same face in ani two consecut month  

what i like though is that this is a drive through  and the time it was too wet too hot too windi or too cold to step out and walk 30 ft to get insid it is great to sit in your car and order   the coffe has never been stale here either  so if i sound blah it cuz this place aint bad the select and tast compar to most mom and pop donut are just blah so this is rate  3blah with one except  to end on a sweet note i like the red velvet donut it not enough to give it four star but prop to them for creat this beauti tasti high calor treat too bad it onli avail until dec 31boooh dragonfli cafe whi did you have to be close for breakfast today  i was almost at dcs doorstep when i decid to use my yelp app to check on the cafe hour and darn it it was close  so i end up at butter instead  

i arriv at around 1030a a bit of a late start sinc i had to switch venu plan but no worri as i would onli have to wait about five minut befor be seat outdoor and it was such a beauti morn too  id have enjoy listen to the water fountain across from my tabl a lot more if traffic sound didnt intrud but what can i do  i quick got over it

i knew to stay away from the sweeter french toast concoct sinc the pumpkin bread varieti i chose for my first visit was too sweet for my tast  it took me awhil to decid what to have blueberri pancak or strawberri cheesecak french toast  in the end the write up on the hous strawberrymascarpon blend made the decis for me  ooh i was look forward to this

i wish i had more time to order a cup of coffe from the coffe shop next door sinc butter drip coffe isnt a fave of mine or of my mom  i gave it a second tri today and i still dont like it  the wait for the french toast wasnt long about ten minut  i found my first three or so bite to be delight but then i got bore  i dont think id order the dish again unless i were to share it with someon els know that i had anoth dish to look forward to  i suppos not all breakfast sweet can be as great as that of the herb box red velvet pancak or even that of dragonfli cafe banana foster french toast  perhap i should just stick to the savori item on the menu such as that salmonlox omelet we enjoy on our first trip here

25 star but the servic was ok so round up to 3  a shoutout for rafael and the busser today  you guy did a great jobif you n yer partner ever pass along about wickenburg way you can rustl up some purdi fair vittl and frozen custard right here

thi here taste freez aint one of them there weinershizzl one neither  it got it own thing a goin on with pizza which i aint never tri but i have set down with one of them there cheeseburg  i had them folk throw some grill onion and bacon on that critter too  it werent one of them high falutin fezburg like them fanci citi folk eat off of central down there in phoenix but it was purdi tasti  i reckon out here in dusti ole wickenburg it stand just fine on it own  yup

god honest truth here as well when i saunter up out of this waterin hole a long tall cowpok tip his big ole hat in my direct and offer up a polit howdoone of the few place that are open late night in the area this is the place i go to after 10 pm to grab a quick bite  i order my usual

7 layer burrito
2  cheesi rice  bean burritos

theyr pretti fast in get your order readi  ive never had a bad meal or servic at this location

return factor  80i notic slight chang sinc my last visit the websit has been remov and i saw a differ person who mayb was in charge

they didnt bring us all the sauc with our spring roll this time but my main reason for lower them a star is becaus the chicken in my meal was terribl dry

i rememb the lemongrass chicken was wonder tasti here so i thought id get it again it still was tasti but i have no idea how they made the chicken so dri i usual give place two star for extra dri chicken becaus that shouldnt be done when you go out to eat in my opinion it so easi to cook chicken when you get veri dri chicken it disappointing

th chicken in the spring roll was dark meat and was ok but not like fresh made good

mayb it was just a slight off day dont know

slight updat new websiti would give this place at least 35 star but they are a sold 3 not convinc they are readi for me to round up to a 4 just yet 

as i leav my offic for my typic late 1302p lunch i decid i was crave a sandwich after see the latest sammich post on twitter know i would be hard press to get a true sammicharound here i began my journey  
i had promis to give the gyro at coney island anoth shot they offer a 755 meal deal hard to beat  but i had also seen that this place spoonz had open up relat recent and i am alway one to tri someth new and spread my wealth around 

they have a few tabl outsid which is nice becaus for the most part this section of the street is shade dure the heat of the day  i walk insid and posit myself to the right side of the counter to see what they offer  
their menu is simpl but with a good varieti coffe drink tea sandwich soupsand salad  you can order one of their sandwich or salad creation or design your own from a list of option  they also had a thick quich in the fridg case and some yummi look pastri  
final decid on the countri ham panini with ginger mango chutney tomato and swiss on multi grain bread 695 plus tax no chipsar they extra i grab a seat in the color relat small diner and wait  

it didnt take long i pick up my sandwich  it was toast and generous fill with ham and the mango chutney was just right and complement the ham quit well i dont recal tomato and the chees was one thin slice relat to the amount of ham  but hey i guess i dont realli need much more chees than that anyway  

the servic was no frill no hello upon entri no dolor your order readi even though they took my name but they did say thank you as i grab a menu and left that countgenerous happi hour a good happi hour  go from 330pm  730pm daili make it veri access to most peopl  happi hour special get you 36 appet 3 beer 47 wine 5 cocktail as well as 12 off premium well drink what a premium well and 12 off their whiskey of the month

aft sever visit here ive found myself enjoy their grill chees and arancini appet the most  gruyer and smoke ham make for a tasti grill chees and the arancini come with a good truffl sauc  the food isnt amaz but these are the two dish that ive like most  as far as drink talk with jessica if your sit at the bar  shes a good bartend that is alway happi to make you a drink base on your mood and palat  otherwis their happi hour cucumb martini is delici and made with hendrick gin  

decent food and good drink make for a nice stop at town squardecent small plate restaur in town squar their menu has a few similar item as their sister restaur bottl  burger minus the burger the arancini 9  risotto fritter with mascarpon roast mushroom white truffl aioli is just as good as the one at bottl  burger it also one of the best item to get at doubl helix

th oliv popper 6 crispi oliv stuf with chorizo and honey goat chees are good and not too salti you get seven per order the bbq pork slider 9 have a slight amount of heat and are top with a sweet apricot sauc and slaw with a margin amount of mayo the churrasco argentino 15 angus american skirt steak chimichurri sauc was tough  and chewi their perfect salad 9 grill asian pear bufala mozzarella candi walnut rocket arugulachampagn vanilla vinaigrett was anyth but perfect the best thing about it was the candi pecan the fri 6 werent as good as the one at bottl  burgers

th atmospher is relax and loungey which is a nice chang of pace from other spot at town squar there is a kid menu our kid was with us and he got the chicken tender 5 actual that should be singular becaus it was onli one chicken tender with a bunch of friafter a hike yesterday we stop here for their lunch buffet  it was almost empti when we arriv but we must have been a draw becaus busi pick up while we were there

they brought us ice water and we order garlic naan  in fact we order a second basket of garlic naan befor we even start with the first  it was quit good

th first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dish  some of the standout here were the  pakora larg triangl fill with a spici mix of veget and the saag  the saag had excel flavor and was veri tasti  i also tri some of the lentil and they were also good

in the second section i had some goat curri chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken  the chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curri  the tandoori chicken was a bit dry

a coupl of thing i note that were differ  there is no silverwar on the tabl  you pick up utensil at the buffet when your there or you go back and get if you forget  i was expect some kind of mtv india music play or video  but they had their tv off which was quit ok  but instead we had pop music which just didnt seem to fit the place

th room is pleasant servic was ok and the lunch buffet was good  there are a few standout item as mention  i didnt have dessert not even kheer which almost unheard of for me  the naan fill me up quit nice along with two plate of foodhave you had a burger from wendi recent  after they start use larger beef patti and better bun  well 5 guy serv a similar burger but larger and with more top choic  

you get all your basic fix found at other fast food burger place with a few uniqu one includ jalapeno green pepper a1 steak sauc and hot sauc  also note that order a hamburg or cheeseburg mean that you get two patti on between your bun the littl option includ one patti  i didnt realiz this when i order so i got quit the burger surpris httpwwwyelpcombizphotosiu55vgrplzvko9sxwbtn3qselectvpsuliqxuwirhvgst9zt9q

mi cowork got a side of cajun fri with his meal and that was way more than enough for two peopl  the fri were noth special and were heavili seasonedsalti  save some money and get one order of fri for everi three peopl or so

for an altern to fri or in addit to you can grab a coupl scoop of free peanut  there a bunch of peanut sit out readi for your take while you wait for your food  wait time arent that long though within 5 minut our food was ready

th restaur itself has a red and white dinertyp theme go on not unlik anoth popular burger franchis in town  there are quit a few banner hang around the restaur show off the franchis accolad mani of which includ someth along the line of someth someth best burger  i thought that it was interest that none of the banner had date more recent than 2009 though

som peopl have made this comment in their review and ill repeat it the music here is loud  loud enough where the person call my order may veri well have been scream at the top of their lung  my cowork and i decid not to talk becaus we had to yell over the music the person call order and the peopl around us

bottom line is that 5 guy make a decent burger that may be better enjoy as take out and with a coupl friend to help you polish off those fri  aokcame here for lunch on a thursday afternoon with some friend random came across this locat upon yelp to tri new place 

easi to find locat locat right next to the chevron gas station on the se corner of flamingo  durango 

greet and seat veri fast though it was quit empti  one other custom at the restaur 

after we were serv our water the waitress left and came back later to tell us the special right befor take our order littl out of order i think dont peopl usual mention the special when you get the menu

i had gotten one of the special for today 

mix grill bbq pork chop andouill sausag and a side of cole slaw and waffl cut sweet potato fri  1299  i guess i was expect it to be a bit bigger in portion size especi in comparison to the chef c teaser my friend got refer to pictur bbq pork chop was grill and glaze with a bbq sauc size was relat small mayb the size of my palm mayb slight smaller sausag was two piec fair good in size togeth mayb like 6 in length lol    i know what some of you may be think       flavor wise both were pretti good the pork chop was cook well and was juici sausag was a bit burnt to a way were the case was black but flavor was good the cole slaw wasnt a prefer in term of salad anyway was ok a littl bitter not sure what type of cabbag or we the chef was use the waffl cut sweet potato fri were fresh and super crispi almost can say that was the best part of the dish lol which mean probabl wont get this again xd 

chicken wing  mildmediumchef special hot sauc serv with french fri and ranchbleu chees dress  899 decent portion for an appet varieti of wing and drumstick the chicken wing were cook perfect juici meat easi to eat and flavor well 

chef c teaser  chicken finger chicken wing onion ring pepper jack shot mac  chees bite french fri celeri  carrot ranchbleu chees  1499  despit the higher price for an appet this dish is no joke  so much food  friend order this as a entre could bare eat half even with some help from my other friend and i the pepper jack shot were light slight spici shape like hush puppi one of my favorit item on this plate wing were the same as the chicken wing list abov fri were thick cut in between normal fri and mayb steak fri best bang for the buck  great for share or eat as an entre between two peopl  

overal good experi chef carlo came out to greet us which is surpris you rare ever see that much anymor great servicwas look forward to a mexican restaur to open up at the biltmor i too miss sam cafe and those yummi chip  someth in walk distanc from the esplanad  

we went on a friday afternoon for lunch  we arriv a bit befor noon and were seat immedi   was shock to see that we had to pay 2 for chip and salsa but order them anyway  the chip were ok  mayb a bit too salti but the salsa was horribl  when ask if they had hot sauc we brought chula bottl sauceoh well plain chip it was

w were told to steer clear of the taco by the waitress  she didnt elabor and we didnt askof cours she suggest all the high price entre but this was lunch and we didnt want to get stuffed

i did opt for the veggi taco and i was happi with my order  how could you mess that up   sweet potato squash corn  veri fresh tast  the sticki rice was interest but couldnt realli eat it all  veri sweet  

the other two meal order was the chimichanga told it was ok and a salad with carn asada ad 5 addit charg  not list on menu and not told dure order 

we were told the fri ice cream was one of the best around again by our waitress so we gave it a tri  it was one tini scoop of fri ice cream that was in a deep bowl and cover in whip cream so you couldnt even see the ice cream  the whip cream wasnt even ani good  when we final were abl to get a bite of the ice cream it was just oksav your money and go get a froyo at mojo in the mall 

although i enjoy my taco  we probabl wont be back  too mani other mexican restaur around that are better  just will have to get into the cari was bore one day did a yelp search on myself  lj r and this place pop up i realli need a new hobbi  the first thing that caught my attent was the 099 taco they have 099 taco tuesday through thursday all day so whi not right and on wednesday it 099 al pastor taco all day hey today wednesday did lj r go to ljr nah mayb next week

ljr has a 5 order minimum for card usag so i had no problem with order 5 al pastor taco it came with pepper green onion lime and sauc on the side the taco werent that bad not quiet like the more popular al pastor taco spot around vega but satisfi i like the meat it was more lean and less greasi but kind of mild in the flavor i was expect it was top with fresh onion and celantro most my taco never held togeth and the fill burst out the middl of the tortilla i just pick them up with my fingers

th servic is friend my drink was refil and food brought out in a reason amount of time they serv complementri chip and salsa not a lot of tabl insid but they werent that busi clean look minus the wall of contain on the counter the rest of the menu sound good and are reason price it hard to say if i fan or not but im at least lean toward whatev side is posit ill have to go back and tri morei got the rees cupcak from here i didnt like it the cake was dri and the frost was too overpow with peanut butter i took one bite and couldnt breath good thing my friend know cpr

but no realli they need to either not keep stuff on the shelf too long or just find a better way to preserv their cupcak caus that shit wasnt the business

i gave it 3 star caus im give this place the benefit of the doubt that i just got bad luck my friend got the marbl cupcak and she enjoy it so suck to be me i guessmy husband and i go out for happi hour everi other friday night  we go to a differ locat everi time as there are so mani differ place in las vega

im a fan of arepa im just not a fan of the arepa serv at viva las arepa  i got their beef empanada and beef arepa  both were greasi and not worth the price 5 for an arepa the size of your fist  ive had this place bookmark now bookmark check time to move on

long review
viva las arepa has been one of my bookmark sinc i was introduc to their neighbor the great art of flavor yes viva is locat right next door in case you didnt know  upon enter your hit with noth but orang and a menu with a decent select  at first the price look pretti good until you get your food i got the beef arepa and a beef empanada  they both tast just ok and were super oili for a minut i thought i was eat a beef chimichanga both were also so small that i was abl to finish my arepa in about 3 bite  i know i cant mention name but i have had better arepa out here in vega better in regard to price valu and most import tast all is not lost though  their plantain and the servic were both excel  i may be back but most like for their plantain onli  see ya but not hereil be next door enjoy the best peanut butter gelatoim a bit torn in write this review 

ive had viva las arepa vla bookmark for the better part of two year now hell mayb more and it wasnt until recent had i been abl to final stop in 

i love that there are still high rate  nonbooji cheap no frill food near the strip i love even more that it venezuelan food  unfortun i may have been driven by the hype so much that i was left slight disappoint 

after a veri long gruel work schedul my beau bless his tire heart was sweet enough to bring me here becaus i list it on my top 3 place to eat while in vega  we drove up to vla which isnt a stand anymor theyv transit to a brick  mortar the park lot is share with other establish and can get crowd dure peak hour 

the menu is larg enough to spell some confus for those saliv tastebud i know these arepa can be fill so i definit had to strateg my meal the man just got himself a carn arepa non shred and 3 shred beef empanada i got the pork buttt and carn arepa in addit to a chicken empanada 

our plate came out hot and fresh within a few minut and those empanada were super hotso hot that a piec of it was left thrown and regurgit back onto our tray lol wasnt by me though we enjoy both empanada though i will say the shred beef was better than the chicken we also both agre they need more meat in them 

i love the arepa itself and they generous fill em with our protein of choic unfortun neither of us were impress with their beef it was tough and lack flavor even with all that drippi sauc there was just someth amiss with the beef 

the pork butt i did enjoy it was moist and tasti and onc i was carb load i pick out all the pork and gobbl it all up 

as cheap a meal as i thought it would be we still paid 30 

overal im sadden this long sought bookmark didnt wow me but i wouldnt mind give it anoth triyelp challeng 2013 36 100 more like 35 star 

i am nicaraguan and i was excit to take my boyfriend here i couldnt wait for him to final tri authent nica food i had bookmark this place a while ago  when i saw the recent review in the las vega week magazin we decid to make our move

th food here is authent delici afford and cook with love in fact dona norma was in the kitchen prepar the meal howev this place is an absolut holeinthewal  when you first pull up you might be turn off by the locat read not in the best area of town or the eclect décor tabl with plastic cover dont let it steer you away i repeat dont let it steer you away if your look to tri someth new look past the exterior and give it shot   


here is what i suggest you try

 cacao made with milk cacao bean cinnamon sugar and vanilla 

fritanga plate this was my person favorit the plate includ an assort of carn asada charbroil beef gallo pinto rice and red bean season with garlic platano maduro sweet fri plantain platano frito plantain chip tradit cabbag coleslaw and queso frito fri chees that is tradit salti and dry

nacatamal made with masa de maiz dough made of grind corn and butter  oliv  tomato onion potato fill with pork and veget and steam in a banana leaf

th servic was fair good there was onli one guy wait buse expedit and run payment for order the restaur was busi and the servic was a bit slow howev our waiter was veri kind and he was realli tri his best to attend to all the tabl in a time fashion i realli cant knock em for tri their best come in with the mindset that this is run like a typic restaur in nicaragua  

it is also import to note that spanish is the first languag at this place the waiter spoke english but im pretti sure he was the onli one work who did for those who dont speak spanish their menu includ english descript and photo 

overal we realli enjoy our meal at dona norma i am veri happi to know that there is tradit nicaraguan food avail in las vega the place is not fanci but sometim youll find some amaz food at place like this we will be backit a littl awkward tell someon you just ate at big wong

you just ate a bigwhat ha ha ha

cheap chines food doesnt have a posit ring to it but this place is all about good food good price good qualiti most chines restaur are over greasi and leav you with a less than satisfactori tast of msg but youll leav big wong with a full tummi and they wont put a dent in your bank account

right next door to monta theyr not there to have a ramen battl their ramen is not japanes style it a cross between pho  oxtail soup with ramen noodl thrown in but there so much varieti be sure to tri the rest of the menu99 of it is 495 so dont be cheap and order a few differ dish a few suggest crispi shrimp wonton salt  pepper wing  the chicken curry

happi noming

tip call ahead they do takeout and they use qualiti contain not those cheesi chinesey boxwhat a disappoint  with all the great thing said about this place by peopl whose review i respect i thought it would be better than it was  i just bare give 3 star  i was contempl two and a half

i was greet prompt on arriv and ask if i was get take out or eat in  the woman told me to sit anywher i want becaus i was eat in and she gave me their small menu  i had seen sever peopl rave about the curri chicken with roti so that what i order  in a short time the cook brought out a bowl of curri chicken and a plate with three veri hot fresh roti  

the curri chicken was good but it would be better name curri potato with chicken and roti  i had two larg chunk of potato one larg cube of chicken smaller that either of the two potato piec while the rest was curri sauc with some chicken shred  the curri was tasti and the roti were veri good

a i wait for my dinner to be brought i notic on their wallwhich has a lot of homemad sign for new dishesthat the curri chicken was list under appet  no wonder the price is onli 495  no wonder the portion is much less than a curri chicken youd get in a thai restaur and for 495 i wasnt expect that

i was go to order someth els perhap some ramen or just a pud for dessert  there were two custom includ myself in this small place that has a maximum capac of 68 peopl  all the time i wait for my order and ate the woman was on the phonenot take ordersbut chat  if she wasnt on the phone she was put busi card in a plastic holder in a notebook and she was engross with that task rather than all two of her customersth other who order direct from the cook and had no interact with the woman

aft wait approxim five minut for her to get off the phone or at least look my way so i could get her attent i got up to leav  i approach the counter and she told whomev was on the phone to hold she took my money gave me chang and went back to her telephone

i dont think ill return  if it like this when theyr two peopl there what would it be like when theyr busysay ten peopl  it just not worth it  and as for dessert i drove up spring mountain road and stop at mcdonald and had a mcflurri  better than her pud id be will to wager even sight unseengreat place to come if your on a budget and want good food and larg portion the dine room isnt as nice as it could be but the price make up for the ambiance

cash onlileoné café is a step abov the chain coffe hous and café  i think they fall a littl short when compar to the 4 star coffe establish we have in vegasthey are a strong 3 star or a weak 4 star in my book though  

they do a better job than most at offer glutendairysoy free option for those with dietari need  i onli end up here if i am alreadi at tivoli though  i have not been impress enough with ani drink salad or breakfast item to come back specif for themnoth was bad just easili forgettive enjoy my three visit howev my last visit in decemb was pretti terrible

it feel like a real cafe invit furnitur the robust aroma of coffe bean the wizz hiss and grind of various cafe machineri it a beauti thing realli great place to hang out or take a break from shopping

im not a huge coffe drinker but that doesnt mean i dont enjoy it ive gotten the nutella cappuccino twice and the pumpkin spice latt as well i love the real mug and the foam art plus both drink were tasti delici coffe  cool cafe  wonder experience

i was told that leoné café serv pastri from patisseri manon which came high recommend so i was excit to check out their case i tri the fraisier french cake fill with strawberri and crème pâtissièr dure my first visit and it was so heaven veri delic cake with delici cream and strawberri 

in decemb the select was not as nice actual the qualiti seem signific lower the fresh fruit top the cake were disgust it was obvious old and shouldnt have been in the case nor on sale the pastri didnt seem to be of the same calib as patisseri manon anyway after terribl communic obvious lack of focus and substandard custom servic from the 23 employe behind the counter we chose the chocol strawberri cake and carrot cake along with our coffe both were dri and just bad

im give them three star becaus as a coffe shop it realli great just avoid the pastrimore like 35 but i will round down due to the cigar stench from the smoke shop next door  i understand it is not the restaur fault but it doesnt chang the fact that it is unpleas 
it is fair spacious insid with a veri standard devoid of person type decor the servic can be hit or miss but even on the hit day it the bare minimum consist of a water refil 
the pho is actual good the broth is flavor and they do not skimp on the meat the price are veri reason for the quantiti of food that you get on my last few visit i had their vermicelli with grill pork and pork past the tast is ok and they do skimp on the meat i order an extra side of grill pork for my husband and i to share just becaus the few piec that come standard get lost in the mix quick i still prefer the pho and vermicelli at pho saigon 8 on eastern and 215 but this one is consider closer to my houswhile at vega streat downtown i sampl a pull pork sandwich that ben bbq brought to the vip yelp tent it was pretti good so i walk down to ben food truck and purchas a hot link sandwich price at 7 it tast good but it should have been call a hot link slider becaus it wasnt veri big i dont mind that it came on a hamburg bun howev for the 7 it cost it should have been a bigger hamburg bun with more link in it the bbq sauc on it was decent but it was just a drizzl and could have use some more it was just too bad that the guy take the order was in such a hurri there was no line btw that he didnt realiz my husband who was stand right next to me might want to order someth i guess he thought the 7  mini sandwich would fill us both up 

the food is good but the special they had go on dure this visit to their truck left me still hungri and feel like i pay too muchive been anxious await for capriotti to open up on mill for about a month now sinc i saw the come soon sign plaster on the bottom floor of the chase bank build on the corner of univers and mill work in the predomin colleg town of temp az im alway look for new and excit lunch option as ive found my surround to grow a bit stale

capriotti could be that new excit spot but it also might not 

pros
monst size sub a small sub is 9 like serious find someon with similar tast to you and split one youll be fine i promise
fresh tasti bread
nic array of top and extra unlik jimmi john down the street where you can have it their way or you can f off
fair quick

cons
no onsit parking
7 for a small turkey sandwich is a littl steep
turkey is mix white and dark meat

th last con is definit the one that will determin whether or not capriotti is the game changer ive been wait for ever sinc my belov rinaldi deli fell victim to the lightrail construct off of mill  3rd st i dont like dark meat i wont do dark meat and until you find a way to separ that ish out i cant partak in an otherwis quit tasti turkey sandwich charg me extra for all white meat i dont care ill deal with it ive never had dark meat turkey at a deli befor today and i dont plan on repeat it

i would be will to go back and tri a few of their other option like the meatbal sub which look pretti decent but a deli that cant master the simpl but oh so delici turkey sandwich is go to be hard for me to love and appreci in the long haulthe salisburi arm was the venu of choic for the yelp christma dinner  no small feat 30 hungri yelper look for a home cosi venu and a delici festiv feast the night itself was wonder everyon brought so much christma spirit and larg due to the love yelper who came i had a wonder evening

i do have mix feel on the salisburi arm general though i realli want to like it and im go to come back to tri it again when it not a larg tabl of 30 dine from a fix festiv menu but i fear that the larg tabl and repetit menu didnt show them in their best light

th venu itself is beauti the perfect set for a warm winteri dinner a fire big couch tall ceil antler on the wall veri nice couldnt fault it really

w had one waitress who was veri veri love and tri her darndest to make sure we were happi the tabl wasnt read when we arriv as she thought it was 730pm not 7pm no biggi were all happi to mill with drinks

howev my one real negat point is this i preorder 2 glass of mull wine for each yelper as a festiv treat it was on the preorder menu so i duli put down the quantiti and all was okd when i hand in the preorder sheet 2 week befor and paid the deposit

aft the starter arriv i realis there was no mull wine when i enquir i was told that they had none oh but isnt that the point of a preorder i was then told by the manag that theyv never had mull wine on the menu ever theyv never serv it so whi did i order it becaus it was on the preorder sheet oh that odd that a mistak they have mull cider instead oh great can we have that no becaus weve run out oh awkward paus well it theyr mistak that they includ an option on the preorder sheet that they never had to serv in the first place so they compd us a glass of champagn each fair dos

they did resolv the issu on the night yes but onli when i chase it up what get me is they didnt check the preorder sheet befor the meal when they had it for 2 week befor and call me to say they had made a mistak they didnt even tel me on the night when they knew they didnt have ani or take me asid to explain they just didnt say anyth that was fulli their mistak so it was resolv yes but i was made to feel foolish when realli i had follow instruct exact as an event organis manag a tabl of 30 peopl with differ food intoler allergi requir and get the order exact right isnt the easiest although i do love see everyon so happi so thing like this realli do get to me as it make it so much harder for me and i know it would have been easi to resolv with a check of the preorder sheet and a phone call

anyway rant over it realli bug me but regardless we still had a love meal the food was 5050 at point the turkey came wrap in bacon yes but was a littl dri boo the brie starter was epic big yes but the dessert all tast boughtin and the yule log tast dri and was the tiniest slice ive ever seen i would have cut myself a bigger slice from a cadburi shopbought yule log and enjoy it more

i will go back to the salisburi arm to tri their food when it less busi less hectic howev i do hope they might improv their communic between staff and work out their larg book preorder system a littl better it basic logic whi take a preorder if you dont then check it and ensur everyth is in place

so yey for the yelp christma dinner thank you to all the love yelper who came and bring the festiv cheer we ate we were merri and it was a love even larg thank to the compani and the ambienc of the arm hurrah and ho ho hovega is not known veri well for it extens vegan option so i was happi to hear that a veganfriend cafe was minut away from the trump hotel where i was stay all i had to do was skip across the street make it through the mall and there it was

it is veri cute in an open are in the center of the mall there seem to be plenti of seat and row of dessert line the shelves

not everyth is vegan but they do special in vegan food and dessert i didnt get a chanc to tri ani of the dessert but i decid to splurg on my meal

i got the veggi paninivegan style that mean they use the vegan pesto and vegan daiya chees instead she ask if i want to add vegan chicken in for a few dollar more but i opt out becaus i felt like the flavor in the sandwich were probabl rich and fill alreadi i stuck with the salad but ad on the plain roast potato on the side

it is on the pricier side especi if you decid to start ad ingredi 3 potato here 3 faux chicken 1 avocado etc

i should have splurg a bit even more and ad the chicken and went for the season potatoes

th sandwich was good but noth extraordinari it quick got soggi and the flavor were surpris not rich and fill it felt like it was miss someth the pesto just fell flat but it wasnt bad i still enjoy it

th salad was overdress and the dress itself was noth to write about
th potato advertis as roast were noth more than steam potato i like that they use exot potato such as red blue yellow etc but the fact that it was simpli steam meant that it didnt have a hearti roast flavor not was it season at all veri veri bland

in the end it was not unenjoy but noth too memor a bit overpr but what isnt in las vega im just glad i was abl to find someth to eat so close to my hotelgrant it was my first visit but i dont get down that way often but i was underwhelm 

the build look good from outsid but it sort of went down hill after that the deli style by the lb serv in carton butcher paper cash onli one sauc thing was overloadnegativli 

i order the cutter choic brisket side and drink for 799  i was given a 35 cut of dri brisket on was paper a small side of bean in a styo cup with a lid a plate which is anoth section of wax paper all fold two slice of walmart white bread on wax paper serv in a huge 2 liter pepsi contain use to carri 10 or more bottl at a time with more wax paper under it all 

the drink was a styro cup with an individu wrap straw individu wrap fork knife and spoon and more styro cup or paper tray for the pickl onion and pepper 

the entir thing was a freakin mess i had more trash to throw away the a famili of four in a normal place yet they onli take cash becaus they want to keep cost downwhat

th brisket was ok the sauc was ok one type yet there are bucket under the cooler of beer that say hot sauc on them the bean were ok realli noth to bring me back which suck becaus they are better then my review and i know itthis is not the worst or best bbq place i have been to so im rate this place a middl of the road rank of 3 star i had the special with one side and a drink for about 10 which consist of the slice brisket and bean im debat whether or not to copi and past daren cs review from 102011 underneath this paragraph becaus i pretti much had the same experi and opinion that he had

th serv of this meal in a carton was a real turn off to me basic requir the custom to take the butcher paper out and spread it out on a tabl and then take all of the item out of the carton and transfer stuff to the butcher paper then get up and dispos of the bulki carton in short too much paperwork to do for a guy out on his lunch break

th brisket was uninspir and the bean were awi would say this place would of been great if their tortilla werent so rock hard dri with razor sharp edg and if they offer hot sauc or fresh salsa im way too much of a sauc snob and i admit it i was veri disappoint that there was no salsa bar or sauc for that matter the taco could of use a nice dollop of moist and flavor salsa

gr the carn asada beef and the adobada pork were marin well and veri tender i need a spici kick in my life even the grill jalapeño pepper they offer us wasnt spici 

i favor the adobada over the carn asada it seem more tender also the taco de cabeza head was realli oili we took a bite and couldnt eat the rest

th vampiro had a sope masa cake bottom and a crispi fri tortilla tostadalik top it was fill with carn asada or ani meat you choos a dens piec of rubberlik chees and top with lot of their guacamol sauc and cilantro and onion it was tasti hard to eat and extrem fill 

their avocado sauc that they put on everyth tast good but it was veri thick and fill it not made of 100 avocado and they may of ad some type of filler in it 

make sure to ask for a complimentari plate of grill green onion and pepper they dont offer it unless you ask for it

6 small taco 2 vampiro and a soda total 230231911

after check out the scene at degre 270 my friend and i decid to end the even w someth sweet at black fig bistro  we both like chocol and peanut and id had the opportun to tri the peanut butter and chocol tart here a few time befor so i suggest we order this  my friend love this dessert httpwwwyelpcombizphotosblackfigbistroscottsdaleselectsoiwht5tat37zkq79yjasoiwht5tat37zkq79yja  we practic inhal it take fast turn at the plate    i was alreadi satisfi w my half of the pastri or was it she w her  p  in ani case we decid wed tri anoth a yellow cake w chocol ganach and finish w chocol and white chocol curl  sound good doesnt it  well it look better than it tast httpwwwyelpcombizphotosblackfigbistroscottsdaleselectjjytwagghvfbwrjk3tfogjjytwagghvfbwrjk3tfog  the cake was veri dri and the frost wasnt as creami nor rich as we both want it to be  the cute curlicu of chocol werent enough to save this pastri  they tast old as if theyv been in the fridg for too long  

id check out the other dessert but not veri late in the daywe stop by the m resort for some light bite and drink the oyster bar that a part of anthoni has and eastwest motif to their menu half of the menu has asianinspir fare while the other half has american fare three type of oyster were offer we went with half a dozen of the smaller kusshi oyster clean and mild tast they were a great start to our meal next up was a cucumb and watermelon salad 10 i envis a beauti compos petit salad what we got was the opposit it was a larg mound of lettuc veget and watermelon drown in a kim chee vinaigrett the flavor were somewhat bold and spici but it was so heavyhand that i could onli eat a few bites

w move over to a differ bar closer to their main dine room to check out their menu yup a complet differ bar menu not sure whi they felt it necessari to have a separ menu but whatev the beef tartar 22 was anoth heavyhand dish the cylindr stack of beef sat atop mix green on top of the beef was a substanti pile of pickl red onion and a quail egg the dish was way too acid drown in a sauc that was probabl mask inferior beef there were two more sauc needless spread across the plate talk about overkil there were about half a dozen ingredi that should have been left off the dish

th last item we tri were the lobster taco 24 surpris surpris it was anoth heavyhand dish with an excess amount of ingredi they use so much chipotl aioli and avocado mouss that i couldnt even tast lobster sauc was ooz out in everi direction

anthoni has a menu  or menus plural  that sound appet but unfortun the execut is lacking

25 starit all about the sizzl not the steak at pvbc

the burger itself is small and not veri flavor if you get just a burger and appli pedestrian top there was a bun  not much to say about it

theyr do a neat thing with the fanci top but when you consid overal valu of what you get for your money combin that with the hype consid what you can get elsewher it just not worth what you pay

for the more mathey that equat look like this
 v   qh    c   

or 
dollar valu of qualiti plus hype is less than competition

 no less than symbol for yelp text field how lamewhat happen 

i order a pizza last night at around 130 am and i was pleasant surpris they were realli fast friend and communic well we order a 12 pizza with half chees and half tomato mushroom garlic pepperoni and sausag we ask for 3 ranch and a 6 pack of sierra mist and all of it was brought to us within 30 minut for a reason price

th pizza was amaz the crust was crunchi and chewi and the sauc was sweet and spici we were so impress that my fiance and i were talk about it all day and tell peopl about the placeth meat on the pizza was fantast especi the sausag and it was overal so great that we order anoth one tonight

tonight was a polar opposit of last night we call a littl bit earlier and the phone call seem to go well the person on the phone recogn our order and was realli friend we got the same exact pizza and an order of mozzarella stick 

the food arriv in around 30 minut and everyth seem great but onc we got the pizza i immedi notic that there was no meat on it  i had request a lot of ranch sinc i end up spill all of mine the night befor and they didnt bring me the request number even though i had offer to pay for a lot

ther was no marinara sauc for the mozzarella stick even though on the phone they suggest the mozzarella stick and that they were good pair with the marinara sauc 

i was irk enough to call them around 130 am to express my displeasur with my pizza sinc we had plan to order from them tomorrow night as well 

the person i spoke to on the phone was not help at all when i said the pizza was wrong he said you want tomato and mushroom right

i told him i order a pizza with 5 top and read the list to him i explain that all i saw were mushroom and tomato he had the gall to say to me well there garlic on there too you cant see it becaus it cut up real small

um that doesnt explain the lack of sausag and pepperoni on there 

he goe on to tell me that there noth he can do for me becaus they were about to close and that i should call tomorrow that total bs in my book becaus hes dump off his problem on someon els who wont know what go on tomorrow and i had order a pizza at 130 in the morn yesterday and had it deliv to me a littl after 2 am 

the pizza wasnt as good today not onli becaus of the lack of meat on the pizza but also becaus of inconsist in the crust it kind of soggi and doughi and as you pick it up the whole slice start to sag and the meager top start slide off with the chees 

im give this 3 star for now becaus im go to call them tomorrow and see how they handl themselv 

to be continuimagin my surpris when a burger place actual has a veggi burger that a vegan can eat 

the other coal burger as they call it is a brown rice and black bean patti it contain no dairi and no egg they serv it on a whole wheat bun which is also dairi and egg free with roast tomato and crush avocado 

this is where my problem start whi do you call it avocado it clear look and tast noth like an avocado both time i ate here it was some kind of wannab avocado spread that turn brown this burger could be a thousand time better if there realli was some fresh slice avocado on it

anoth thing i dont get it whi the french fri are frozen they tout food matter and where your ingredi come from matter more  
we are commit to great flavor and excel ingredi we are commit to food rais natur and without the use of pesticid and harm fertil yet there is onli a hand of organ ingredi on the menu and again they are use frozen french fries

with those kind of statement i expect a lot more like fresh cut fri made in hous and all organ ingredi that would make you stand apart from the crowd

al in all i give point for the vegan patti but everyth els is just like everywher elscame in out of the rain to kill time befor meet locksmith at my client home nearbi i was reluct even with the good yelp review to tri out this hole in the wall establish  but my long for a nice hot bowl of soup to warm me up was stronger than my fear upon enter beij noodl cafe was the typic chines restaur with minim decor and a red glow that onli seem appar in photo i was greet and seat immedi the lunch special look tempt but after some yelp research i decid on the wonton noodl soupwonton seem like a popular choic amongst the yelpers
mi soup came within 5 minut and it was delici the broth was nice and hearti with fleck of red chili seawe and shrimp and the wontonsuniqu long roll dumpl burst with flavor in a thin wonton skin these were some of the best wonton ive had in vega i didnt care so much for the seawe becaus it gave it more of a japanes tast so i must  rememb to ask them to omit it next time the noodl had a great chewi textur to them and i too was hope to catch a glimps of the noodl guy make them but ala no
it was a satisfi bowl of real chines comfort food this discoveri was just in time for the cold weather ahead 3 star for now but i will upgrad my star onc ive had a chanc to tri other item from their menuif i had even the slightest shred of self respect i wouldnt come here but im current the duke so make of that what you will   

the servic is terribl the place is alway cold and give fork to westernlook folk and chopstick to asianlook peopl without give you the choic is annoy and just give you one napkin is there a napkin shortag i havent heard about just put the napkin and cutleri on the tabl and let us do it ourselv that would mean fewer encount for the rude staff to endur too one fork one napkin and one menu as john lee hooker didnt sing sort it out

so whi do i go back the food absolut delici under five pound for a tasti stir fri or soup with free green tea of cours i alway spend more as i cant resist the crispi chilli beef strip for a starter see photos

it just the kind of place that edinburgh need  no frill cheap and cheer noodl hous in the centr of town the menu is a crazi concoct of various asian dish but it better than wagamama and half the price the singapor noodl with the option of ho fun rather than vermicelli are fantastic

i was go to give it 4 star for the food but last time i had to eat with my coat on becaus of the cold and one of the staff was incred rude though the other was veri nice but ill keep go back for the food   william is kind of like kws tim horton okay not realli tim horton is flourish in kw too but there certain seem to be as mani william coffe locat as tim in the city

william serv coffe obvious but it also serv a wide array of sandwich smoothi and dessert they actual have a kitchen where they prepar meals

they also have free wifi which keep this place pack with univers student and professor alik all camp out in the booth work on their laptop there also a small patio

you order and pay at the counter in exchang for a big number you put on your tabl so they know where to bring your food or drink when it ready

thi locat is alway buzz with peopl so dont expect to get ani quiet read done here but if you like a bit of background nois this is the place for youim alway look for breakfastbrunch option around town so when i heard that ncounter had recent open i check out their menu onlin and i was sold i knew i had to go tri it out  it look like 16 or so other beat me to the ftr and theyv onli been open for a week so i guess there were plenti of other peopl excit about this new restaur open as well

im be veri honest in give a three star aok review but im optimist that after anoth visit or two ill be bump it up  the first thing i notic is that ncounter is locat in a veri conveni corner locat off of mill and 3rd st right off the light rail  next off their hour 7am  305pm daili  interest  upon walk in i was greet by a bunch of friend servers

i love the fastcasu concept where you order at the counter henc the name i suppos and then get your drink on your own but then your food is brought to you i was torn as i look at the menu as there were a hand of item that sound good to me  my intern dialogu went someth like this

mmmmm smoothies

oh wow  they serv espresso and amaz sound coffe drink too  veri impress but ill skip those today sinc im avoid caffein while be prego

bloodi mari mimosa screwdriv greyhound and more im for sure come back for one of those after this babi comes

ok  back to the food menu those wheat germ granola pancak sound like theyd be right up my alley

but mayb i should just go for an omelette

that bakeri case look pretti damn appeal too with cake pop muffin pastri and more

aft much of the abov debat i decid to order a fresh squeez oj and a greek omelett with egg white and no onion  for my side i went with whole grain toast  i grab my oj and an ice water and found a tabl and despit the restaur be pack our food arriv within 10 minut  

here where my construct critic come in for ncounter 
a coupl of onion got thrown in there but that forgiv  
i suggest toast the bread a bit more if your go to call it toast mine was not toasted
th verbiag that is list with the omelett on the menu say with your choic of toast potato fruit cottag chees or tomato  so i assum my omelett would come with my choic of one of those thing  it actual came with potato as well as the toast i ask for which was a bonus but i wouldv prefer to order toast and fruit or toast and cottag cheese
th artichok on the omelett were cold but the rest of the omelett was hot  just kind of a weird combo with each bite

asid from the abov complaint my food was good and consid theyv onli been open a week i had a veri posit first experi here  overal this place is awesom and a welcom addit to the hood  i cant wait to go back soon and tri those pancak or perhap a smoothipretti good lunch spot their signatur spici tuna salad is a healthi choic but wonder whi it not spici at all it come with a tasteless oil that doesnt do anyth for the salad definit get a soup or sandwich to go along with it or youll be hungri they also offer flat bread like pizza sandwich panini and soup i like the seafood bisqu which i found out recent was onli offer at their las vega locat they also have the sweet green tea i like 
great altern to fast food lunch trapi realli realli want to give this place more than three star becaus the staff is wonder and friend and the servic is great but the food just isnt 

i brought my nana here onc for afternoon high tea we order the cream tea platter which come with 6 tini triangl sandwich two egg salad two cucumb two salmon two scone with jam and cream a few littl pastri and your choic of tea we order english breakfast  

the english tea tast just like home for me home is ireland and is made fresh with tea leav and brought to your tabl in a cute littl teapot the food is serv on one of those tier platter  veri cute in my opinion the finger sandwich would be much better if they were better prepar  perhap with more fresh ingredi and flavor the bread was a littl hard and stale and the salmon was dark in color with a less than pleasant odor now the scone are what made my day and might be the onli thing that keep me come back they are serv warm dust with powder sugar and with fresh jam and cream which make for great top i could probabl eat about 6 of them if i was feel realli naughti 

i brought my nana back here for afternoon tea a second time and we had pretti much exact the same experi the sandwich were averagestal the tea was great the scone were great but everyth just had that this could be a lot better feel to it 

on our second visit we also share the fish  chip which were averag at best the chip were definit fresh cut and actual tast veri similar to what you would get in england or ireland howev the fish cod was realli soggi and lack flavor i dont know how fri fish can come from the kitchen soggi but it did and i couldnt even eat it 

they have a decent happi hour everi day and their select of beer and cider is quit good plus the atmospher and decor is invit and veri pleasant i could see myself pop in for a few drink dure happi hour but i wouldnt order food

3 starmy friend had recommend that he enjoy this place when he was in vega  they final brought the first franchis locat out in the valley rais cane is a paradis for ani chicken finger lover  there are movi poster all around insid the restaur and even in the bathroom area  a disco ball abov is rotat and reflect light beam down while you place your order  they have plenti of space for park  the chicken finger were realli crispi but noth too special   i do like the texa toast  as norm mention i wish it was more garlicki as well  the coleslaw was far too wet for me  i think the cane sauc was similar to one of arbi sauc i so want to give them more star howev there are so mani place that have better chicken strip for that priceafter pass by this spot numer time while get a fat tuesday i final gave it a shot 

i order the connecticut total came to near 18 but then again it vega for that price my expect were somewhat high

i encount a pretti long wait time for order and get my food the roll was realli good not salti and dous in butter like i expect and the toast bread was perfect the size disappoint me wasnt even the size of a 6 inch subway sandwich

worth my money 

not quit not enough to fill you up not mouthwat enough to make you feel like your money was worth it with earl of sandwich just around the corner id rather go there and get an entir meal for less than one sandwich at this spot

definit not a bang for buck spot but if money is not an issu i would come back 
if i do come back i want to tri the mac n chees and lobster on a sticknot the best dim sum ive ever had but it definit a solid choic when your in the henderson area i came here with cowork today for lunch and i like that we have this option near work 

walk in i was pleasant surpris by how larg the interior of the restaur is we were seat quick and within five minut we had a tabl full of goodi to enjoy we tri quit a few thing i can never resist noodl in xo sauc and we order tripe bbq steam bun and an assort of other thing as well we of cours had to end our meal with egg custard as well 

we had a dim sum newbi in the mix so we tri to get lot of differ thing for her to tri and it made the experi that much more fun servic was good and refil on tea and water were plenti look forward to ad this to my regular lunch rotatmilk is a littl expens 349 gas price rise they charg 75¢ for air for your tire but they have a redbox outsid so we stop quit a bit one good thing is 44oz soda off the fountain insid for 79¢ it clean and never seem to be much of a wait theyr aok in my reviewhit buldogi a few night ago   perfect time  hit the gym for about 2 hour probabl burn at least one hot dog so i went ahead and order 3and some angri kimchi fri but i onli ate 12 of each dog  

i like the concept of this place  a lot of top option  didnt realli pay attent to the top price so not sure if reason  i opt for the specialti dog 

the kimchi fri  didnt do much for me  the sweet of the sweet potato fri domin the overal tast  i was expect some savori some heat but i wasnt feel it

th dog  all under 5   the buckey chili chees and the banh mi  i like the top on all three but im not sold on the hot dog itself  not sure if it due to my tast bud be dull by year of eat der weinerschnitzel dog ampm dog or the ultim slot of fun mega dog or was it due to eat there just befor they close or mayb the hot dog aint that good  

given the creativ of the top and the good servic i think it worth anoth tri but if the dog still doesnt float my boat sad there no futur for me and  buldogis

p attachwe decid wed get someth differ for dinner and i was off to buldogi which has been on my radar for a few month  drive out of villag squar one even i spi buldogi so now i knew where to go

for the two of us i got a smoke dog an angri dog a small regular fri and an order of euro special fri  i enjoy the small amount of heat with my angri dog  id say it was more of an irrit dog than angri  perhap i should have ad jalapeño slice so my dog was a bit more angry

mi wife like her smoke dog  the slaw and garlic mayo were veri good  the euro fri were tasti too 

i was so glad i got thing to go  there is so much top on the dog that it get your hand full of liquid and top as they are squeez off the dog no matter how gentl you hoist that doggi  that not a problem  it just that im glad i could be sloppi in the privaci of mine own home rather than dribbl in public

on downerin look at the photo i saw vega js photo of some bread pud shed had for dessert  no dice  they dont do dessert anymor  oh well i still have a few lett macaron from my last trip to la so i had a plan b that was quit good

th order was made quick and the counter guy was veri help and polit  everyth was aokupdat sin cityburg has sinc move i have no clue if they have the same promot or how the food qualiti may have changed

i am alway on the lookout for a new place to tri for lunch so when sinciti burger open up down the street from my offic i knew i was go to have to give it a shot sooner or later when my cowork told me she want a burger for lunch recent i knew it as time to give scb a shot

i had the 14 burger combo it was not a bad burger but it wasnt realli anyth except in my mind it was well cook no hockey puck here the lettuc tast fresher then what youd get on a burger at other place perhap i just need to order it with an egg or one of the other extra top to make it stand out my cowork said that she like her turkey burger and i like that they have that as an option the fri were realli thin and crispy

5 for the burger fri and a drink did hit the spot though there are special on tuesday 99 cent slider or hot dog that i think i will like take advantag of soonsinciti burger is not in my neck of the wood  howev i am known to drive around town in search of the best burger or whatev els i happen to have a crave for at the moment  so when i read mike cs review about their signatur burger i thought i would give them a tri or two

sinc burger is a momandpop burger joint insid a strip mall surround by mani big box store within the greater commerci shoppingentertain campus aka centenni plaza in the nw part of lv  everi item that requir cook on the menu is cook to order so that is a plus in my book but you also have to allot for the time it would requir for them to prepar your order although i am sure they are more than happi to take your pickup order over the phone

so here is a quick summari of my person experi and impress on the item i tried

sahara burger option to go up to 3 patti start with 1 patti angel 2 patti saint and 3 patti which they call sinner which is top with pepperjack chees grill onion  jalapeno guacamol lettuc tomato and their hell sauc  it is a decent burger and with all the top and sauc can definit get all over your hand and face  the hell sauc has a littl kick but not enough to make most peopl that doe not have a capsaicin sensit cri home to their mama via facetimetm  35 star for me

badass burger i went with the 3 sinner patti option again and i had to unhing my jaw like a boa constrictor prepar to swallow a fulli evolv raichu top with swiss chees green leaf lettuc tomato grill onion  mushroom bacon fri egg and their sin sauc is good  the combin of ingredi and the sin sauc is badass  45 star   recommend 

grill chicken sandwich  big meati juici grill chicken breast in a bun  i would recommend it if you want to skip the red meat

i also tri their chocol shake which is okay  their mapl bacon shake is one of those off the wall idareyoutotryit item that was differ but not someth i would default to order but the salti crunchi chewi bit of bacon in creami shake is not even a level 2 fear factortm food challeng unless you have a dietari restrict against consum pork  size of the shake could be bigger for the price tag

homemad onion ring  it is serv pipe hot short right after it tortur hot oil bath but i am person not a fan of their onion ring batter  

current they have a 599 burger combo promot which is pretti good if you work or are shop in the vicin and want a upgrad from the typic fast food burger plus it is staff by friend  help people

ask for napkin if you dinein i did not see a napkin dispens but they were generous with napkin on my togo order  use your yelp checkin promo discountthe highlight for me was the bread basket  good chees lavash a multigrain bread with cherri and bacon bit and slice baguett  the cherri bacon bread was outstanding

i order the vadouvan squashsquash root veget in a rich curri with couscous  it was good but i would have like a bit more curri flavor to the dish  

after dinner the server brought us a complimentari plate of miniatur macaron  it was a tasti end to the meal

servic was good  my ice tea was replac with a fresh one when i got low on the first one  water glass were refil  our server was super about 5 peopl pay with cash and credit card  

the room was veri loud when we first arriv at 730 but quiet down as some of the diner left  i like the film reel on the ceil in go with their barrymor theme  i think the place is a bit overr  i dont think id make a return visit  the price dont justifi what you geti was so excit to tri this place with all the great review but i was not that impress this is kind of a late review becaus we came here like a year ago so i dont know if anyth has chang 

we came in for lunch mayb that was the mistak we didnt even get to sit in the pretti main dine room nor did we get that delici bread basket everyon had mention even the server wasnt that attent good thing the busser was 

anyway we had the french onion soup which is pretti hard to mess up 

the burger was good but it wasnt the best burger ive ever had from what i heard they dont even serv this burger anymor 

we also had the chicken lunch entr and that was horribl we both couldnt have more than a coupl bite of it 

so mayb we will come back again for dinner or tri out the happi hour on their patio but definit wont be come back for lunchin vega you roll the dice and hope for the best  i was look for a suitabl earli dinner to fold in to other plan that had alreadi been made for the even and i want someth uniqu and just a littl special  i want to avoid the signatur chef restaur the one name after chef that rare step insid the kitchen and look for someth a littl off the beaten path  the barrymor seem the right mix of good review uniquestylish set and a menu that would appeas a vari crowd
th outsid has littl bear on what to expect onc you enter the barrymor proper  though small the bar and dine room offer a lot of style point pack into your field of vision without be ostentati or over busi  the servic drag at one point but was overal commiser with the price point  neither hover or over aloof  the sommeli was also spot on and offer a great select off the modest price wine list
th not so good part unfortun was the food  in a word made up of two word lacklust  there was not one thing serv that live up to anyth abov a three star experi  both ny strip at the tabl were difficult to cut at time and noth approach what youd expect at ani steak hous abov a salt grass or outback  and in fair to those establish i should say that i had no difficulti cut the steak ive eaten there on rare occas  the bearnais order as an accompani did littl to liven the affair tast of littl more than a flat wine reduct the lobster mac which is by no mean a uniqu item fell equal flat  the wallpap should not appear richer than an item that practic scream ridicul ooz opulencewith lobster  but it did  the salmon was cook wonder and was consid a success though it sat unfinish at the end of the meal  
perhap we miss the mark by not get the bonein ribey and the sweetbread instead but it onli a guess that well return to see if ladi luck reward the brave or further hinder the foolishmeander my way through all the shop i spot this littl chocol kiosk chocol alway call to me so i stop to stare  the women man the booth was friend and chatti she mention that vincent pilon is food network a lot i had never heard of him but i thought i better buy some goodi anyway 

well the woman help me forgot to put the box of chocol truffl into my purchas i was soooo sad when i realiz later so i cant vouch for his candi but i did tri a cupcak a browni and a chocol candi thingi   

cupcak was awesom best peanut butter frost i think i have had wow httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfseu1caovyk3uaawuvshaselectfltaviwv5jhr8mkisbgna

whit cupcak with coconut had to tri cuz i love coconut nope dri and no coconut flavor anywher httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfseu1caovyk3uaawuvshaselectf0mktsuqigcijrj5velyjg

browni cooki  yum good and rich a friend said it is too rich and choclat what doe that even mean  how can anyth be too rich and chocol so obvious this was good httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfseu1caovyk3uaawuvshaselectqz6sqsgu97zuh2ywq8ltxa

chocol crisp candi bal good noth out of the ordinari httpwwwyelpcombizphotosfseu1caovyk3uaawuvshaselectiaftmmaaarw1v96zxhnyfa

a solid 35 star for good peanut butter frost and browni cookia great place to meet with friend and have some coffe or beer my major complaint is the that there are so mani peopl with lap top that are kind of hog the seat which make it awkward to ask them to move so your parti can sit next to each otheri dont know about your daddi but my daddi never got down like this 
onc again i am wish for that 35 star option as the food is fresh and flavor the servic howev never fresh or alway fresh if you consid a fresh mouth by the staff 
i am not sure how long they have been off western in the hood but i do know i have order from here deliveri at least 8 time in the last year possibl more they have the classic pizza wing and sub but do not wast your money on the unhealthi option 
daddi is here for fresh juic smoothi salad vegan stuff kabob and other mediterranean health food 
i have had the chicken kabob the chicken and brown rice wrap and numer differ salad the onli time the food disappoint is when i order pizza 
they take pride in what theyr good at the pizza and wing are just extra for the custom that come from the strip club across the street smart advertis realli 
i would be will to give this place 4 or even 5 star if they treat peopl a bit better 
when rush the food lack qualiti or take forev at least 3 time i wait over an hour for deliveri i have never been treat with great servic a pleas and thank you goe a long way 
i will be will to up my review if they up their game as wellwas my first time here for a uuy dinner that stephani fluffi bear k kind of put togeth at the last minut 

on this night it was a nice 76 degre even with a slight cool breez where we sat was just right insid next to the patio the door to the patio were wide open which was let some of the cool breez in i was impress by this set up so my first thought of this place was pretti good so far

a we look over the menu one main thing stood out to me the price sinc me and my wifey were go to our favorit late night happi hour restaur later we decid to share an appet a salad and a main cours im glad we did becaus if we actual order our own meal it would have push the bill to 100 easily

so for the appetizerw went with the spici ahi roll price 15 as the server brought it out it look pretti good the problem i thought was that their were onli four piec now i have been to some place where we have had ahi roll befor and i know they are kind of pricey but this was ridicul you would think for that price we could get a whole roll like mayb eight piec instead of four 

for the salad i order caesar with the dress on the side price 10 for that price i was think mayb they did someth differ to it to make it that expens mayb have a guy dress up as julius caesar come out with an entourag to present this magnific salad but no it was just your basic romain lettuc parmesan chees and crouton as a side note their cheapest salad was a spring mix which was 8

last for the main cours we got the slow roast tri tip price 20 now this was actual decent i still dont think 20 for tri tip justifi it though came with mash yam and spinach 

overal the food qualiti was below averag especi for the price the total came out to 54 dollar and some chang that with a 20 percent tip includ i have been to a lot of other place where you can have soup salad and a main cours for under 20 dollar dont get me wrong i am not a cheapskat but ill be damn if i pay that much for a meal  that i cant realli rave about 

in close the atmospher and servic is pretti good here but the food is not worth the ridicul price they charg you origin i was gonna give two star but sinc i was with good compani that probabl distract my disappoint long enough to give you guy that extra star

speak of good compani shout out to my good friend kevin l ollan a and his wifey kristina c d and his wifey evelyn includ c d jr last but not least to the person respons for this night of fun the most loveabl and huggabl person you will ever meet stephani fluffi bear kgf and i tri today at lunch as expect a nice clean store 

gf went with the salad bar i think it was 750   i went with the new york yanke  hot corn beef and pastrami swiss your choic of mustard or mayo  mayo with cb and pastrami  realli   on rye  8  

i was a littl tick  i initi want a deli club but i was told they ran out of bacon  on a saturday dure lunch hour  so i ask the cashier if i get it do you give me a reduc rate sinc there no bacon  big surpris the answer  no   

i then start to pay the tab  21  includ 2 drink  with a 100 the cashier say  i dont have chang for that   holi shit batman here an idea  go get some frickin chang elroy  so i paid with a debit card 

the food  the sammi  nice portion of meat decent flavor but dang they must store the meat in a vat of juic becaus the one side of the sammi was soak  overal it was good but drain the meat a littl or mayb put it on a grill for a few minut i went with the hot mustard but they didnt come close to put enough on to add to the flavor 

the salad bar is good  nice select of item includ some love muffin a few dessert item and some soft serv ice cream 

of cours as we left  goofbal cashier yell out pleas come back sir im sure well have bacon for yousmart ass i tri the tom yum soup and my husband had the shoyu ramen  both were ok  the boba tea was better  lot of flavor and pretti good  

they do offer tofu in the ramen which i think is uniqu  the anim theme is cute  and servic was effici  the server were nice to us but  i think the server uniform are funni  do those poor girl realli have to wear those aw platinum blond wigs

th park lot was so pack on a friday night that peopl were park in the fire lane  but this restaur was dead  if you need some quick food and dont want to wait an hour for ichiza this is an optionlet be clear price have seem gone up and servic isnt what it use to be just look at the higher review on this page and you find the period in which their 45 star begin to taper off 

just sayin

couldv sworn id review this place in the past if i did it wouldv receiv a 5 star rate easili i suppos realli didnt feel the need to at the time consid it held and deserv it high 45 mark on yelp as a great breakfast spot pretti deep in anthem for a while up until now it not that they serv terribl food im sure they still have pretti decent breakfastbrunchlunch option id just say chalk this place up as a place that mani yelper use to frequent but havent updat their review recent 

in anycas ive onli been here onc sinc the origin owner chris left vega and his meat and three spot close down a few store over i realli love the place prior to him leav im not sure i feel the same way about the place after his departur 

be in the culinari industri myself along with his tie to the bay area i was abl to share some great convers with him about food polit life and some great concept and idea he would even help fellow bud restauranteursentrepreneur by provid a place for food truck to setup shop in front of the restaur as well as food truck battl to take place and even a pop up restaur within his own busi 

to find out such a forward think visionari  especil in this town is gone is a bit dishearten and upon my last visit bb sad seem like a ghost of it formerorigin owneri went for the brunch today 
first of all i just dont understand whi they didnt serv brunch at green that where the kitchen is they were veri adam about wait until 9am until anyon could place a brunch order even though the place was fill up befor 9am 
though onc order were place food came quickly

th plate were brought over from green and probabl play a hand in whi the food wasnt hot but it was more like due to it be pre made quit possibl the day ahead of time and not heat well which in turn made for a veri dri tofu scramble
 i got the sage sausag hashsheesh unfortun no sage flavor just one note flavor even so it would have tast better hot and it would have been nice to have toast with it as well

bi the time we left it was stand room onli 

i may be point out the obvious here but nami should stick to be a coffe and pastri shop and let real meal be at green where food can be serv hot from the kitchen into a dine room that can accommod more peopl mayb consid have an option to order brunch at nami for the overflow but to have it sole there is asinine


ps
id like to add that the first time i visit nami i order the fluffernutterin
soynami which is organ peanut butter banana ricemellow fluff and toast marshmellow flavor and i stood there and watch her scoop in skippi peanut butternot coolfals advertisingfaili like fri chicken i perhap would say that im a fri chicken fanat  normal i like popey ani chicken that is spici  the chicken here wasnt spici enough and the outsid and bread wasnt crispi and crunchi enough  regardless for airport for it pretti goodwent to genghi grill to redeem a free birthday bowl and this was my 1st time at this locat i have to say the set up insid is nice  

went to go get my bowl made and when i got their a young man ask me what type of meat i want and he was serv them into the bowl and i thought oh this is differ guess he is put my bowl togeth for me and after he place the meat into the bowl then he gave the bowl to me to finish up with it which i did just wonder whi i wasnt abl to put my own meat in becaus i would have ad much less than what i got haha even though i am a carnivor i do love my veggi and i just feel genghi just doesnt offer much in the veggi depart but they do have udon noddl which i happen to love

mi lunch bowl was good servic was friend and glad to stop by and ad them to my lunch time listle thai arriv in downtown vega with good thai food and a lot of spice but they forgot to add custom service

drop le thai in las vega koreatown and it would be a decent 3 star thai place  itd be good but not award win  but in the culinari wasteland of downtown vega le thai stand out as one of the best restaur option  problem is the custom servic goe in manic wave between friend and passiveaggress rude

first the food  ive eaten most of the menu and there are some real win dish  the tricolor curri is solid  combin red green and yellow curri in coconut milk is surpris tasti  if curri isnt your bag go for the awesom noodl which are    well fkin awesom  the sweet and spici flavor is rich and blend perfect with the noodl and the load of veget that come in the dish  the cook do a great job with cook the meat in the dish  it will be tender and wellseason  

this place is serious about it spice by the way  a 3 out of 5 will have your nose run and youll be ask for more rice to cool down your tongue

th pad thai is just decent  ive heard some folk rave about it but i wasnt blown away  id come back and order it when im in the mood for pad thai and stuck downtown but it far from impress  the beef and meatbal soup is similar mediocr  it tast like a bland pho 

as for the problem with custom servic go there dure a slow period of the daynight and youll probabl have a good experi  but when the place get busi the staff cant handl it  on at least 2 occas ive come in when the tabl are full and the staff was busi  the first time it was this busi one staff member told me to stand by the bar and put an order in so my meal would be readi earlier  anoth came over to the bar and rude told us that we were in her way could not order in advanc and that we would need to wait outsid  anoth time the staff handl a busi day by ignor us for veri long period of time

bottom line some of the best food in downtown but the staff can be downright rude 
35 star for the food minus 1 star for poor custom servicdont hesit to stop in to le thai if your in the area

l thai is popular thai restaur in the heart of east fremont  the staff is wonder friendlyeven when they are slammedwhat els would you expect from a place with the visionari prowess to offer free hug with a yelp checkin  

most of their dish are abov averag  i usual go with curri dish when im here becaus there noodl are a littl less consist and have been over cook a coupl of time  the bottom line for me is that you are pay a littl more becaus of the locat but there is not a singl item i have tri that i dont enjoy more at anoth thai restaur in town  the food is certain good enough for me to stop in if i am on east fremont though

they have an enclos patio in the back that is delight when the weather is nice and heat well dure colder timesavoid it in the summer though  the shade is not enough to keep the temp down

com here if your on east fremont and in the mood for thai
com here if you have had too much to drink and need a bite while you sober uptheir hour are certain accommod to the drink crowd
com here when you are lone and need to cash in on the free hugso on christma day i was do the tradit fanfair of eat chines and go to a movi  i end up skip the movi and came here for dinner instead ive driven by this place plenti sinc it a few mile south of where i live  ive never eaten here befor but stop in yesterday to grab some dinner

upon enter i found the price to be fair  999 for an all you can eat chines buffet with a decent varieti of food  i survey the buffet area and grab my share of food  here some of what i found while dine here

they had a select of some sushi mexican food and ton of chines food  they had a decent select of soup and i went with the egg drop soup hot tasti and went down oh so good  had some sushi and that was okay not the best but seem to get the job done  skip the mexican and went right for the chines food i sampl a few dish and all were pretti tasti  orang chicken sweet and sour chicken lo mein noodl all good

i think they even have alcohol beverag for sale i saw some booz on the back wall but i didnt order ani pretti neat that they sell booze

th downer desert section was awe not onli was there a crap select but it was hit beyond belief  most of the tray were all but gone and pick over when i was there  select was serious limit to put some veri dri and bad tast cake thingi and some peach in syrup i went with the peach becaus they had ton of ice cream and with the weather be cold i didnt want ani ice cream desert area was just a fail over all

not the best buffet but not the worst food was okay price were fair and there was a decent amount of seat  i cant say ill never be back but consid it was open on christma day and some of the food was okay i gave it 3 star  just okay realliso ive seen the open soon sign for some week now and was excit for a new sandwich place in the neighborhood after kick my own booti at the gym i was starv and crave meat i decid to negat my work out effort and give capriotti a tri 

i was realli conflict on whether i should go for the meatbal or the philli chees steak chees steak won small size with mushroom and onion and a small drink just under 11 i had to gasp for air as i felt like someon just punch me in the gut and mug me this better be way yum 

when the sandwich came out i calm down a littl about the price the small is 9 give all other small sub out there major feel of inadequaci and turn into two meal for me it reheat veri well the next day i might add 

the sandwich was tasti noth to write home about i realli like their bread it funni the other guy complain not enough meat and i would realli like to have seen more mushroom and onion in my sub the onion are dice and veri small so i had a difficult time detect their flavor same goe for the mushroom 

i was disappoint when they told me they didnt have malt vinegar i love dip my chees steak in that stuff the guy suggest red wine vinegar and i was so desper i tri it it was pretti good still cant beat malt though hope they will get enough request for it and add it to their inventori 

it is obvious they just open and are work out some kink here and there total understand and noth to give them a hard time about i will be back for more 

oh and they deliv sinc we dont have a jj in deliveri rang i am thrill about that fact ive round down on this one from 3 12 star to just 3 star and youll see whi as you read below  

i am a student of number  sorri that just what i do for a live  so here are some number  there are three capriotti in the valley accord to yelp  the phoenix locat has 65 review and a four star rate  temp has 18 review and a four star rate  and scottsdal has 21 review and a three star rate  

im sure this statist proof will make my fellow yelper scott d veri happi sinc he has state that scottsdal is a tough crowd  given my two dine experi i would say it has less to do with the scottsdal crowd as it doe with the folk behind the counter and the price of the sandwich  

im realli in agreement with yelper andrea k   the employe bring down the overal capriotti experi  on my first visit everyon was sur behind the counter and ill temper  on this trip i was just gross out

last night i visit capriotti around seven and order the medium chees steak  as i wait i fill my drink and watch the bull v miami game on the big screen nice touch  

after five minut or so i walk over and figur that my food would be readi soon  as i wait the guy in front of me had an order mix up  someth about order the 20 and get the 12 instead  i was surpris when they remad the order and told him to keep the extra sandwich  nice

in front of the counter on the employe side was a pile of tabl scrap and garbag on the floor  so i took a pictur becaus i was kill time and thought it was amus  it look as if someon was in the middl of clean the floor and just got distract oh well  

mi order came and it too had a mistak  somehow it was made plain instead of the work  no matter the manag told me he would remak the order  again i thought you could just add onion and whatev  but he said no problem and told me to come back in a few minut  so i walk over to my tabl and watch the bull make a run at miami from be down five point  good game

aft five minut or so of watch the game i walk over again think my sandwich would soon be readi  yep the pile of garbag was still there on the floor  so i took anoth pictur  the manag was there and he told me it would just be a moment  incred everyon was side step this pile of garbag  just then a kid came over with the sandwich and slip on it  too funni  the manag admonish him to watch it i told him it might be easier if you just clean it up

so it was back to the bull game but now with my sandwich in hand  twenti minut after i had order it  okay the sandwich was veri good  i like it a lot better then my first experi with the brown meat roast beef slaw be jo  the chees and the onion were the right mix to the chop meat  and the bread stood up well and had a corn meal bottom to it  all nice  

the chees steak remind me in mani way of the jersey mike version of the same sandwich which isnt a bad thing  in the end even though it was veri good sandwich i thought nearbi corleon was slight better  of cours corleon close at seven so where could i find someth this good at seventwenti  in the futur i realli need to work on my time management

wel it was now seven fortyf and the bull were firm in control of the game  i went over to refil of my drink  yep i look  and yep the garbag and tabl scrap were still there on the floor but now it was more spread out from the mishap with the kid  

okay im done with capriotti for a while  for 1153 i will take my busi elsewher and rememb that corleon close earli  im go to agre with dave s on this  it an expens sandwich even by north scottsdal standard  but it not a bad one  it just that the overal experi leav much to be desired

sorrii felt good go in  i felt good eat there  i felt woozi on the way out  went with the cowork to the new hag  the environ is cool  nurs lot of big screen tvs a kind of 60s diner feel  the tvs play music video from the 70s and 80s  thm menu make joke about the price of tax which our govern squander or someth like that  this place definit has charact  oh yeah and the waitress nurs are pretti damn hot

th food was great  i love my singl and fri which was more than enough to fill me up  the burger was juici and tasti and the fatcoat bun were amaz  one of my cowork ate an entir quadrupl hamburg 15 pound patti  our waitress wheel his fatass out in a wheelchair  none of us were big enough for the weight in at 350 lbs or more and eat free  mayb my quadruple cowork will work on this  

the servic was friend effici and easi on the eye the price werent bad  they dont serv water at all  im not sure that is legal  well see how long that last  also the place is cash onli atm insid  plenti of malt liquor brand are offer but not a lick of qualiti craft beer

i guess the realli bad part about hag is how you might feel afterward  my stomach is current upset  my head is foggi  im pretti sure this review will be poor written as i cant realli focus right now  i mean the bun are coat in lard for gosh sake  hello cholesterol and sugar overdose

great to experi onc but i wont be make a habit of eat here  if you dont eat a lot of fast food you might want to think about eat mcdonald for a week befor hand to train yourself up to meet the heart attack grill challeng  i didnt and now i am pay the consequthe heart attack grill  a fantasi of scantili clad nurs and greasi burger  oh this could be soooo great  it posit make me cri that it just miss great  let me explain

first off the place requir sexi nurs  well  they had uniform but honest i think you will do better at most of the casino brew pub  the girl are cute but seem more like the crew i would expect at in n out burger  i know  i know this has noth to do with food  but hey  i didnt invent the place  i am just go by the imag they project  and this demand to be rated

ok so the food  burger are good tasti and slight overcook  the fri  well  not worth it  but i have to say i love the simpl menu  if you are in the mood for a refresh ice tea or a diet coke head someplac els  it sugari beverag liquor or milkshak  ok  im in    the shake are the thickest fattest shake i have ever seen  there is actual a piec of butter on top  ya well  look at the name of the place  overal  a fun menu

burg shake coke and a guy get spank by teenag waitress in nurs uniform  overal not a bad lunch  it realli not about food qualiti here  this place is suppos to be an ultim male indulg  sexi it up a bit and figur out a way to take credit card and i would add anoth star  make it adult onli and well talk

oh ya if you are over 350lbs you eat for free  ummthis is a uniqu burger experi that is for sure but uniqu doe not necessarili equal posit i mean it realli cool that there a huge scale outsid where you can weigh yourself 247 the scale weigh heavi by the way  and wacki rule like if you weigh over 350 lbs you eat for free 

but if your homeless and hungri i guess not sad but okay it a busi not a soup kitchen i digress

upon entri you are fit with a hospit gown and wrist band the server are all refer to and dress as doctor and nurs and the menu is set up that way as well tripl bypass burger flatlin fri etc 

the burger was huge and i onli went with the simpl singl bypass but it had veri littl flavor same with the fri i had a water and it was outstanding

so for the kitschi experi id say everyon should come do it at least onc but onc was probabl enough for me 

oh and just one final suggest weigh yourself befor you go in youll thank me laterheart attack grill is a hamburg joint with a zani parallel univers hospit theme  waitress dress in somewhat provoc nurs outfit the type of nurs outfit youll see in fantasi playback in movi with everyth all boost up and stick out  follow the theme each custom is requir to wear hospit gown upon entranc  their burger is eloqu name the bypass and depend on the number of patti itll be the singl doubl tripl quadrupl more if youd like bypass  

when a place is call heart attack anyth it is a strong red flag that a vegetarian option may be out of the question  parodi movi poster are plaster all over the wall  while im no jason bourn i alway do a scan of ani place i go too befor settl in my seat  here my sight stop on a rather larg scale  abov the scale was an indic pronounc whoever weigh 350 lbs will eat free  first off if you weigh that much eat here may be hazard to your health  i was lucki enough to see a fellow custom climb onto that scale and win a free meal  siren went off with applaus follow  

a close buddi from la had been talk about tri this place out on a coupl occas  the three of us look at menus in hospit gown was a sight to see  after a coupl chuckl we order  the smallest of the group end up order the tripl bypass while i chicken out and got the doubl  we all share a side of chili chees fri which could have fed five or more easili  size are massiv and while i did finish most of it i dont think it was a particular good idea  splice chili on top of each burger patti insert anoth layer of tast to a burger that consist main of over greasi meat flavor  take out the notion i was clog my arteri at an exponenti rate after each bite the burger was ok    

the novelti of it all is an experi in itself  see a coupl japanes tourist be spank by the nurs waitress is anoth interest sight  rule is if you dont finish you get spank  im assum this was option sinc ani normal human would assur have troubl finish these burger and not everyon got spank  align their extrem gimmick with the same motto of a more adult hooter equat to more show than emphasi on food heart attack grill is worth at least one visit  i dont know about a second  my heart may not be abl to handl it010513

25 stars

cam here on a persian cowork suggest i tri it  i was inform by the nice young man that tast of greek was out of the steak pita that my cowork told me to check out  sinc i tri to avoid chicken and lamb due to food allergi steak and chick pea are the onli protein id be consid anyway  sinc steak was not an option tonight i went for a la cart item of chicken pita 795 regular hummus 450 or 495 and a coupl of falafel ball 1 for two pieces

surpris it took longer than i expect to prepar the falafel ball and pita wrap which i took as a good sign that they were cookedtoord  the hummus was the onli one that was preprepar and it came with one oliv  a rather tasti oliv at that and it was a piti that it was all by it lonesom sinc the bite that includ it was the onli time i thought the hummus was worthwhil still ive kept the contain in the fridg as it still is a protein sourc  howev now that i think about it if it not organ then realli im not do my bodi ani favor say no to gmo

th falafel ball were pipinghot and tasti albeit a tad too salti  again im go to assum the chick pea werent organ and the soybean oil use to fri it wasnt either so this may be the last time i ever speak of them  the first few bite of the pita wrap didnt win me over until i rememb to add the tzatziki sauc id request to be on the side cuke allergi  after id slather on the homemad sauc it was  veri good  worthi of a few allergi symptom even  

ill be come back to give the steak wrap a tri but i doubt ill be back for the other item unless tog  goe organ  if you know of ani organ mediterranean restaur pleas let me know  this place is pretti neat in the name you would assum it like most divey pub but it not it a fancier restaurantbar with 52 beer on tap and a nice food menu great locat and atmospher for a date night or to chill with friend the onli down side is it pretti pricey for noth special burger pizza calamari thing like that the price are up there yes there are 52 beer on tap so it may be worth it if your a beer person if not meh we went on a pretti busi night so i figur servic would be a littl hectic and slow well they definit show me our waitress were on the ball with everyth veri quick nice and profession i am certain interest in go back and tri a few other option on the menuwe enjoy the grape and gorgonzola salad top with toast pine nut and fresh torn basil this salad had a realli good tast  a veri good grill piec of tasti lamp bread come with the salad mani nice salad are on the menu and they are larg as a meal or enough to share

next we had to share a pizza so we went with the margherita pizza but ad calabrian pepper soon the pizza came out and the crust was veri thin and veri crisp but onli half way and around the middl it was soggi the sauc seem good the reason i am give three star instead of four star is becaus i didnt like the chees blend on this pie the chees on our pie came out chewi and rubberi not melti gooey i note they do offer a varieti of chees and other might be better neither of us like the calabrian pepper becaus they were heavili salt and we didnt expect that also the pepper didnt pack much heat we didnt ask for calabrian oil on the pizza but we were told they ad it to our pie instead of the oliv oil that they normal do sinc we got the pepper so i might have gotten more flavor on my pie than it normal gets

i like that the slice are thin and veri light
overal this place is worth a triin the great battl of who is better fogo vs texa i vote texa de brazil
her is how the battl pan out

reserv we made our for 9pm on the monday befor christma with eas both restaur are a winner in this categori tie
ambi for 50per person befor tip  without drank you expect a nice dinner not gourmet but nice fogo atmospher was not as impress as tdbs warm color tapestri and larg open room texas
salad bar my favorit part of the brazilian barbecu experi is the salad bar fogo was ok but onli if that was the onli brazilian barbecu that youv ever been to they had limit and not veri impress select tdb has way better chees select more fresh look ingredi and lobster bisqueyumm i also found myself want to go for second at tdb and not fogo texas
cocktail barwin list we perus the wine  cocktail list at fogo for quit a long time but couldnt find anyth that caught or eye i feel that at tdb they have a way better and larger select texas
chees puff bread i love those littl chees puff so much that i even attempt to make them at home but i feel like the one that i made tast better than fogo at tdb i have to stop myself from fill up on those addict littl sucker texas
meat i am not much of a meat person but i found that i have been eat much more of it as of late at fogo i realli appreci how they would cook up a fresh batch of meat and bring it straight to your tabl if they did not have it circul on the floor and not just the specif meat but the specif meat to the way you want it cook i feel as though the meat at tdb can sometim be a tad bit salti for my palett  i would score this categori as a tie but the last select of meat that fogo brought out fresh grill lamb chop was divin not too gamey and perfect cook fogo
servic was great at both place tie

so you can decid for yourselv but if i had to choos again which place to go to i would definit choos texa de brazil 


hot tip the napkin in the bathroom at fogo are just as wonder as the napkin at tdb if you know what im talk about lolboil crab has some good shrimp and decent oyster  oyster were on the smallish side but the shrimp were nice and plump  one of the newer seafood spot in town boil crab let you order seafood by the pound with your choic of sauc  i went for the whole sha bang sauc which is a mix of each individu sauc garlic cajun etc  the sauc was certain garlicki but it lack that delici punch that make you crave more heat  when it come to restaur like this it all about the sauc and sauc was just alright for me

a for the restaur itself it is spacious and litter with small tvs  lot of seat avail both tabl and booth  walk in it was nice to not be overwhelm by the smell of their special sauc probabl due to the larg space  dure my visit there were sever larg group that came by and there was no issu with seat 20 or so peopl togeth  one interest thing that we notic was the amount of wait staff work  we got there around 400pm and there were about 25 peopl work  base on the amount of custom at that time everybodi could have had their own individu server

overal boil crab is a decent spot but their sauc did not win my heartwent here for lunch base on a friend recommend easi to be seat inform there was no blue crab or dung crab i love dung so this great disappoint me 
i order the snow crab with a side of corn on the cob my friend order hot wing and crawfish somehow the hot wing were forgotten and deliv late and they were dri and not to good rest of the food was good if noth special servic was veri good

i went to one of these place perhap the parent place in california a few year ago and that was a pretti good meal this one be similar was not up to those standardi agre with ashley d  this place is beauti the decor in amaz and the kitchen look impecc howev i didnt feel like i want to come back as a place i would like to hang out  we went with anoth coupl who suggest the place  the food is not bad howev it is not memor  as a nativ italian i know pasta and pizza i state with the heirloom beet salad that was delici  i think my favorit item of the night for my entre i had the tortelloni they were good howev i think they are overwork the pasta  there were spot that were realli tough at the seam of the pasta  by the way the portion for this dish is realli small which for me it ok sinc i am alway watch what i eat  the fill made with mascarpon was great  i was notic while we were eat at one of the high top tabl that one of the kitchen member was beat the heck out of the pasta  i have to say though i was covet their pasta machin  the wonder of autom i have to crank my pasta maker  i think i should get me one of those befor my mom next visit  my hubbi had the housemad sausag pizza again the dough was so overwork that the pizza was too chewi and not in a good way  my friend had the gig a pasta with pesto sauc veri nice  her husband had the pig pizza  he left all the crust sinc it was too chewi  the dessert they push is the salt caramel budino it is good but as a sweet tooth person i didnt finish it and that is a lot to say  not much dimens or textur just pud like textur all the way  on the other hand my hubbi dessert the affogato was delicii have to prefac this by say im not a huge buffet person be a beauti day my wife carol our friend kathi r and me all head to goodyear to the caballero grill sunday brunch it was about a half hour drive from our home 

former a mcgrath fish hous the caballero has a kindof lodg feel to it with lot of wood throughout the restaur it is a place where you can bring the famili or outoftown guest 

when we arriv at the restaur we were immedi seat our waitress sam short for samantha took our dink order and told us  about their sunday brunch and instruct us to go help ourselv point out first where everyth was situat 

today we had brunch for 20 per person the brunch offer a nice select of seafood item like crab leg peel and eat shrimp claim on the half shell bagel cream chees smoke salmon a carv station serv up roast beef omelet made to order at their omelet station waffl station a select of fresh fruit salad and the usual bacon and sausag biscuit and gravi  egg benedict and a list of other dish the brunch also come with champagn or they  have a mimosa plus your choic of beverag like ice tea coffe or soda the brunch also includ a small desert tabl that had miniatur cupcak macaroon and a few other pastri item on it 
 
all in all the brunch buffet food was fair noth spectacular and not good enough to make an other half hour drive for dont get me wrong it was ok but that about it it a brunch buffet what can you realli expect 

most of the food didnt appeal to me which is rare becaus i basic eat ani and everyth all the time 

foodthey had a decent varieti of food not spectacular but the qualiti of food just wasnt there the roast beef was good but what i expect  are you get my drift here noth exceed  or possibl even met expect which was disappoint they featur veri few wow item egg benedict omelet made to order sausag bacon belgian some fruit salad crab leg clam rubberi smoke salmon not lox some of the better dish i encount was the omelet they were made to order as was the waffl which were pipe hot and tasti servic our waitress sam was warm veri attent friend and cordial but not overbear it was superb  it is what youd expect when you go out to eat  price  imo at 2000 per person it is a tad pricey conculs i have to believ that in order to rate a true restaur experi you have to take everyth into consider food and servic you will walk away stuf nice atmospher the servic is the type of servic that will keep me come back  return factor 0 on the buffet brunch but i will definit tri this place again for dinner it deserv anoth shot

 what doe my overal rate mean

5 star high recommend  i would be will to drive out of my way to this busi it is that good this place repres their industri or cuisin veri well 
4 star  high recommend i would frequent this busi 
3 star  not that good but not that bad just averag i wouldnt mind go again 
2 star  i would not recommend this establish to friend or famili 
1 star  do yourself a favor and do not patron this busi i would run away from this place and you should too dont wast your hard earn money at this establishdefinit a fan but withhold a star becaus happi hour end so earli that said jay knock my sock off with a fantast old fashion and were not talk some sugari water down bourbon drink it was rich refresh with mild oak and bitter citrus

th ambianc is relax and comfort 

the tater tot were abov averag but a littl salty

but most import in my recent quest to find a great place to be dazzl with a great cocktail from a crackerjack bartend jay deliv i look forward to have him impress me with tequila at distrito nextit isnt anyth spectacular but it isnt terribl either sometim the food is a littl extra crispi and sometim it is just right i would give it 4 star but realli must give it 3 becaus it isnt consist everi time and certain thing have been question i will say this though ihop is right across the street but i would defiant choos this place over them ani day that still doesnt say a whole lot about this place

i usual order waffl if it isnt overcook it is veri tasti i tri the chicken and waffl onc but the chicken just seem like a frozen chicken finger they nuke and put on top  the egg are usual the onli thing cook perfect and they do tast good i have ask for side befor such as extra ranch or mayo and gotten weird extra in the cup it was brought in 

basic this place isnt bad everi onc in a while but to take famili and friend i would go t rachel kitchen or up to bagel cafe i get a coupon everi now and then in the mail and that is when i general eat therebe that im new to this side of town im realli tri to find a decent bbq place to eat at sinc im to far from all my favorit on the east side of town  a few week ago i found this place ate there and just never bother to review it  tonight i went back for second sinc i had a good experi the first time and it wasnt as much fun as i remember

th first time i was here it was a saturday night and there was hard ani one in the place  i came here tonight friday and the place was slight busier  i went up to the counter to review the menu and the girl who took my order answer my question i thought i had told her that i was eat there i swear i did  she assum that i was carri out  i dont know how that got mix up but my first red flag should have been her say you can wait at the bar i said no im go to sit in the back  

so order the brisket sandwich and wait in the back  other patron that were there befor me all got there food and eventu my order was readi  after she deliev the other order to the tabl she look at me and said your food readi  um okay so bring it out like you did the others

eventu the other girl walk the bag with my food in it in a to go box with no drink to my tabl i told her that i want to eat it here and would like to get a plate she apolog and took the bag of food back with her  at this point i went up to the counter to get my drink becaus honest i was get kinda thirsti  as i approach the girl who initi took my order was talk to the guy work behind the counter and take order and sort of look in my direct as i got closer they sudden stop talk look down at the floor and scatter  i guess im  problem custom now to much of a diva or mayb im just so tire that im be  crazi and irrational

eventu my food came back out on the plate and the brisket was okay   if i had review the place the first time i went i probabl would have given them 4 to 5 star now 3 and that about itnot again

w were lure here by the rave review from fellow yelper but our overal experi was just aokw came for happi hour to take advantag of their half price pizzas

i love me some white pizza and i love truffl anyth so we ask our waitress if we could do a half whitehalf truffl pizza and the gentleman make the pizza said it was perfect finesweet

w were also eye the di fara advertis their legendari status so we went with that as well we chose the new york style for both the servic was great and the pizza guy person deliv our pizza to us and even serv us our first slice which was a veri nice gesture

you know how you first tast someth and you have that moment of silenc and your eye roll to the back of your head like the exorcist becaus it so damn good
i didnt have that moment in ani of our pizza not the white not the truffl and not the legendari di faratast is everyth and what we tast was an overkil on garlicyou can never have too much garlic right that what i thought but it got so overbear we want to like the whitetruffl pizza but it turn out to be disappointingth di fara was okay but noth legendari about it imo and im not such a fan of the pepperoni use hereperson preference

they use new york water in their doughyeah yeah yeahth crust got hard and tough as it cool obama got pizza here when he was in town whoop dee doo
sorri just aok for mealoha

yelp 100 challenge80100 domfoundjust tri roamin dough for the 1st time today at the first food truck smackdown

th two ladi in charg of the food truck were extrem nice they explain the entir menu even though we were there for a sampl i love their menu but promis myself i would onli do the sampl to keep a fair and open mind 

they gave us two of their bacon wrap date sprinkl with feta chees and drizzl with sweet vinegari sauc not like date i tri them anyway alway give the benefit of the doubt sad i was not a fan it was veri sweet but i still can agre it was full of flavor sweet and salti 

the custom servic was great and they gave my daughter a cute blue pin wheel to have i cant wait to come back and updat with their famous pocket32313

stop by after the renfair to have a drink dure happi hour and while i didnt eat anyth i did tri a pint well i drank about half a pint of sierra nevada hefeweizen  im assum it kellerwei sinc i just purchas a sixpack from sprout and the sip ive tri awhil ago tast like what i tri here at lb  i cant recal the cost breakdown but i rememb think that the price on  beer draft were pretti good  craft for 4 or less is not too shabby

thank good it wasnt veri cold indoor like it was when yelp held an elit event here  it was middl of summer and yet i was freez  today was a beauti day mid70 i think and it was veri comfort insid  onli thing i didnt like was that it was veri dark indoor at 530p  it made me wish i was outdoor enjoy the beauti weatherstill on my health kick hey it a lifetim commit and now i know there are at least 2 healthi place to eat within a 5 minut drive from home daili kitchen and well bar is one of them the first thing i notic is wow  this place is tini probabl the same size as my live room it is probabl one of the smallest place that i have eaten at in las vega at least there is room to eat outsid if the place ever get full note there are no mister 

i order the spici thai chicken wrap it was just ok the ingredi seem fresh lack a littl in the season depart i didnt realli tast much the spici thai peanut sauc  perhap if they use a littl more of it it wouldnt tast so plain was it worth the almost 10 they charg for this wrap i didnt think so my partner wrap on the other hand was tasti she had the mediterranean wrap it had me think about falafel the whole day i didnt order ani of the fresh juic but did notic that the price is a bit higher than the other place

hmmm pancak are on the menu i may have to come back and tri thattotal yummi spot to grab food if your stay at the saguaro the decor was absolut ador i found myself look all around admir the light fixtur various art piec on the wall the color etc 

and while the food was tasti i wasnt total blown away there typic breakfast fare here with some dish that have a tex mexmexican influenc and there are also dish like waffl and bagel noth look like it took a tremend amount of effort to make and while i wait about 15 min for a bagel and lox i somehow manag to think that it took a while to prep the order becaus the bagel was local made or made in hous but everyth on the plate was someth bought at a local groceri store so i was a littl disappoint becaus for the price i paid i could have had 3 bagel and lox at home it was good though and consid that most peopl eat here are pass through it a total reason and yummi place to have breakfast the juic serv are good and the bacon is definit worth orderi have never been crazi about china a go go from my perspect it is a level abov panda express and fast food restaur in general howev it is a level below mani casual dine chines restaur the major of the time that i dine in china a go go is dure their lunch special china a go go is a 35 star chines restaur that i never went out of my way to dine in the usual scenario will be that i am in the immedi area and make a spontan choic between a few fast food restaur to patron  most of the time the fast food competitor are a nogo for valu and i will hit up china a go go for lunch this is what occur last sunday

  i was visit my brother up in north las vega we decid to visit aliant natur discoveri park and the aliant trail system the smith shop center park lot was the trailhead if you havent been to this shop center it includ arbi kfc subway and other eateri china a go go was the win choice

  china a go go is just as familiar to me as panda express china a go go is a goto spot for decent chines food in the las vega valley the upshot is their locat are sprout up across the las vega valley not everi locat is ident at some locat you order the food at the counter and pour your own coke beverag but at this locat the friend waitress greet my brother and your truli she seat us and serv our food when the styrophon cup of coke was low she refil it she was friend and made my brother and i feel welcom too bad i cant say that about an element of the higher price restaur i visited

  order at china a go go is as easi as 123  you dont even have to walk insid to glanc at their menu it is outsid on the window the luncheon menu rang from 595 to 650 for shrimpbas entre 

  i order the shrimp chop suey luncheon special it includ soup of the day fri rice and chow mien noodl the soup of the day was the exact soup china a go go has been serv me for the last six year egg drop soup dont get me wrong egg drop soup is good but it is noth like wonton soup three star i enjoy the shrimp chop suey china a go go was generous with the portion of shrimp and tasti shrimp i might add threeandahalf star the fri rice was tasti filler food i appreci that around 30 and not 50 of the plate a styraphon bowl by the way was taken up by chow mien noodl there have been a hand of chines restaur that have left me with a sour tast of the place on account of too much of the plate be taken over by filler chow mien noodles

  when all is said and written i could return to the aliant parkway china a go go when i am in the immedi area dure lunch a 35 star chines restaur is alway a candid for a futur checkini dont like pay for chip and salsa  just give us the darn thing and charg for refil  the chip were inde good but i dont know about the 4 price tag mayb even lower the price  happi hour has great deal if you are into highend tequila  all tequila and appet are 50 off  i have onli had the app carnita en chile verd becaus it is so delici bowl of yummi melt in your mouth pork with chees etc with homemad chip to scoop it up  the patio and atmospher are decent  my servic alway seem to be alright here not horribl yet not great either  not sure i would go out of my way to come here asid from the happi hour am i do anoth 5k whi am i carbo load  question that were run through my head as i had more bite 

we order fettuccin suprem bake ziti pepperoni pizza and cheesi garlic bread also order sassi strawberri italian soda

so glad we onli order the small size between the 5 of us there were still plenti of left over about half a plate for both fettuccin and bake ziti but mayb it becaus we werent realli impress with the food realli like the soda though in all it strawberri goodness

servic was on the slow side we had reserv for 400 and arriv on time but still had to wait 1015min to get seat anoth few minut for our server to get our order the entre didnt come til 20 minut or so later and yes i was time it caus i thought my sister was on some kind of schedul 

also this locat is pricier than other buca so dont be shi to use those coupon that they lure you in withthis is a review for the loung not the club  though i realli want to come for the nightclub next time im in town

i feel like this place has the potenti of a 4 star but i cant in good conscienc give it more than a 3  ill updat my review when they get their servic in order

let me prefac this with the fact that i am a relat patient person when it come to flaw in servic  ive work in retail and know it can be hard to juggl custom  but the complet lack of servic from our waitress was just not forgiv  

we wait 15 minut after be seat for someon to come take our drink order  after come to the realize that no one was come we flag down a server who said he would take our order to our waitress  our waitress who was hang out all the while came over a bit after to confirm our order and pretend like she was do something

th server came back with our drink after a pretti long wait and apolog say that our drink took a particular long time to make becaus there was someth wrong with the comput  my guess is that there was actual someth wrong with the waitress  

the cocktail were delici and the view just behind the bellagio fountain veri near justifi the bad servic  note that i said nearly

th waitress brought us the check for the first round of drink and prompt disappear  we want to order anoth round but of cours she was no where to be found  we flag down the poor server again who was a good sport about it consid it wasnt his job  but after a while the waitress came over and rather impolit inform us we would have to pay for the first round befor receiv the second  becaus of cours were gonna jump the barrier into the fountain after we down the second round right  well whatev we pay cash and expect to get chang back to sort out the tip  but the waitress doesnt give back a dime  we were intend to give her a 15 tip and she took over 20  i was a bit taken back by the poor etiquette

aft we got our second round she gave us the check and came back around 3 time to check if we were readi to pay at 5 minut interv  what kind of servic is this  honey your big fake boob can onli get you so mani tip  you need to learn the basic of servic if your go to appeal to all your clientel  on the last round we tip her 10 then hand the server who help us extra on he way out the door  i know it rude but if you split the differ between the extra she basic stole from the last round and consid how bad the servic was i think it was justifi  either way i can live with it

i want to devot most of the space in this review to talk about how flavor their cocktail are and how amaz the view is  but the servic just ruin it  i hope ill have someth more favor to say when i come back for the nightclub in junewow new buffet  especi indian buffet have been pop up so fast sinc the first of the year that it hard to keep up with them all  so here we have southern spice which has open up in the former home of weak taj mahal  i stop in today to tri their lunch buffet

som weak points

  they open at 11 am but appar i know that better than they do becaus the food wasnt all out until around 1130  it should have all been out befor open time

  there were eventu onli 16 food item plus condiment  that small even for an indian buffet

  there were empti tray  space  no that not ok  you put out someth in everi space on the serv line  a few hard boil egg some chive celeri something

  as when i was here twice when it was taj mahal clear up around noon onli one other custom had enter the place

  there was sambar soup but onli dinki littl bowl  no soup spoon or tablespoons

     

ok there was good too

  the tabl servic was friend  the young ladi check with me sever time to make sure i was happi with the tast of the food

  there was a choic of plain or garlic naan  i had the garlic flavor  it was serv hot toast just right  it was good

  the rest of the food was good too  i had some salad tasti chicken tikki masala somewhat similar palak excel tandoori chicken vada similar to littl donut chicken curri gulab jamun monkey ball gajar halwa carrot pud  so on

in summari i wasnt thrill with the place overal but i will say that the food here is almost 2 star better than it was as taj mahal  they deserv more than two custom for their lunch rush     o

lunch buffet 999 tuesday through thursday  more on friday through sunday  close mondaysmore red velvet and oh so mani decad choic of pancak but unfortun im not much of a pancak person and want egg the omelett had four egg that way too mani for me so due to other choic to balanc out i had two egg breakfast i want to pick someth differ but there werent mani healthi choic carb carb and more heavi carb i mean i could make the omelett an egg white omelett but it an up charg and i like egg but the egg did come out the way i like the rye toast was good and the fruit salad was a good varieti 
grape berri and melon was nice he got the full heavi breakfast deal as he want hash brown and he was quiet and smile so was happy
th custom servic was great as our waitress was attent and friend nice littl set up and didnt have to wait long good littl place but for the type of breakfast i like it averag and ill probabl stick to other placewho get cut off from eat all you can eat i did my friend and i decid to give this place a shot sinc my fianc and i like it the first time we came here and all my korean cowork recommend the place

w came on a friday night around 730ish seat for 6 peopl no problem becaus we call ahead so we wouldnt have to wait the place was pretti busi my cowork were excit to tri this place out sinc they fell in love with tofu hut but woonam jung has way better meat qualiti it took about 20 minut befor someon final came to our tabl i order a bunch of meat but the ladi said i order way too much and had to wait for the next round round one done round twoi order about 4 differ meat which finish within minut yes i was eat with a bunch of scaveng when it came to order more it took them 30 more minut to get to us after they gave us our order they said no more what did we just realli get cut off from orderingy i was shock but it okay becaus we were all full but still 

the food is good here dont get me wrong but the servic was slow we got cut off from order and the grill is too small they should add at least 2 grill for a seat of 6 or morei need to start with a warn i have a loveh relationship with chris bianco i love his food but hate his restaur this loveh continu now with his new ventur the italian restaurant

mi husband and i decid to tri italian restaur tonight we arriv about 615 we knew from past experi with bianco restaur go dure the week and go earli 

note it is tuck away in the town and countri shop center you will not see ani signag until you walk toward the restaur area of the shop center

it is a tini place with not mani tabl there is a communal tabl i despis communal tabl if i want to eat with random peopl i will join a commune anyway i digress so we were seat a small tabl for two now this is where the hate come in small tabl next to anoth small tabl ughh

also if you are look to have a convers with anyon in the restaur good luck with that not onli was talk to my husband difficult i could not hear anyth the waiter was say i can just imagin if it was that hard to hear on a week night what a weekend would be

next area of content is the patio ahh this is what i loveh of mr bianco just like pizzeria there are seat on the patio but of cours you can not order there just extra seat for wait now this is genius from a noncomsum side keep the custom comfort seat while wait plus add some wineb to the mix so even if the even custom end up peac out befor dinner you alreadi made your money on the over price alcohol genius prime exampl bar bianco next to pizzeria bianco now whi i hate this it could be use for more seat less wait time i dont know about you but my time is just a precious as chris biancos

last complaint the server was extrem rude not sure if he was have a bad night but anytim i would ask a question or make a clever joke ok mayb corni joke he would give me the wors look or answer my question like i was dumb the menu is small and mani differ dish so question will be rais he also rush us i understand that there is a wait and they need to turn over tabl but i want to at least feel relax especi when pay higher price for meatballs

so whi am i give the restaur 3 star the food it was awesom just when i want to have a reason to dislik bianco his food remind me of whi i am there in the first place all 3 star go to food the other fault just are too much to be ignored

w start with the hous bread and oliv oil bread is awesom doe he need to charg 2 for it probabl not but he know that more like than not you are go to cough up 2 for bread again genius

i had the meatbal and polenta it was delici was it worth the price 18 ehh not so much but again when in bianco restaur expect to pay a littl more

overal i plan on return sometim in the distant futur just not tomorrowi have been hold off write this review for awhil becaus of one silli littl snag i just cant get past i want to wait until the bitter pass but that just not happen 
and yes 100 is what is hold me back from give this place a better rating
i went for brunch with my friend tracee
w each order coffe when the server ask if we take cream we both said yes
not realiz how larg the portion were we decid to split a muffin as an appet i dont rememb which one  but it was perfect
trace went for the stuf french toast with bacon huge and delici i opt for the prosciutto arugula and goat chees omelet with home fri realli good  and a lot of food
w were both stuf  but the owner come out to tell us about dessert lemon pound cake with strawberri and a ricotta mint sauc it sound too amaz to pass up so i ask for it to go but bring 2 spoon so we could tri it on our way out
it was phenomenal
it is incred rare i do three cours for my first meal it was a ton of food and it was all truli good the servic was friend the place is clean and quaint
so  whi onli three star with such posit thing to say 
the bill
in addit to the charg i was expect for the 2 coffe there was a charg for the cream for the coffe 050 x 2  100 upcharge
wtf
even the chain coffeehous provid as much cream as you want at no addit charg mani restaur have the creamer on the tabl as a matter of cours if you order coffe never befor  from greasi roadsid diner to fine dine to world class resort have i been charg for cream for my coffee
thi upcharg wasnt on the menu it wasnt mention when we said we would inde like cream for our coffe if it was i would have been incredul the concept is complet alien to me
100 doe not make a differ in my restaur choice
but in this case  i thought it was so tacki and borderlin underhand  no matter how much i enjoy the meal and the experi befor the bill came when i think of wy not my first thought is the asinin charg for cream
and it left enough of an impress that i am in no rush to go back there are other good place with great food in town that are more than happi to consid cream for coffe to just be the cost of do busi and not sneak it onto my billstreat is cool becaus it free entri it in the fun downtown area right next to el cortez and there is lot of food to be had  like food truck  never been to one and want to tri it out  then follow streat on facebook or twitter to find out when the next event is

streat is not cool becaus if you go earli it pack and if you go late the truck are sold out of half their menu  i also find the music irrit but that might be becaus ive gone at the wrong time  or im old

it also not cool becaus ive grown tire of pay outrag price for the food  five buck for a tini order of fri that has a littl bit of parmesan sprinkl on top  i just got an order of fri at buldogi for 3 and was three time the size  and they are pay for upkeep of a real restaur not a truck

last if you are a vegetarian dont expect to eat anyth here other than fri and mayb ice cream  i was at streat last year and got so piss at it that it took me this long to come back  whi  other than fri there was not a singl thing i could eat  i went up to a grill chees truck that had onli sandwich with meat on their menu and ask them if they could just make me a plain grill chees  they told me no  wtf

feel like a minivers of first friday  fun to stop at if your in the area or if you want to visit your favorit food truck but if you want to have a more epic food truck experi wait until first fridayfor me a statist tie to it neighbor rudi  neither veri impressive
i ate here in earli may a week after rudi and i do not think they were quit readi to open  the layout and line manag are clumsi  the staff is poor manag  it felt like watch a ladybug soccer match everyon run toward the ball with nobodi stick to their station  and there is no reason i should have to carri a menu through a cafeteria style restaur where i am also carri a bulki food tray with 2 hand  just look at your neighbor  put the menu on the menuboard
sauc tast offtheshelf but was still better than it neighbor rudys
3star are for potenti  the meat is decent  work out the kink on the staff side dish and dessert then do a few more tenant improv to the menuboard and line manag see rudi drink tub and cold side dish cooler get some good beer scrap the heavi cooki sheet use as food tray and mayb this place can outlast rudiso i decid to stop here after be on some kind of bbq kick and hit up rudi yesterday i want to give this place a shot sinc it right next door to rudi  i dont know if it on purpos but i think it kinda funni that their side by side  kind of like a gas station next door to well anoth gas station

i came in and the place was kinda quiet it a swelter sunday afternoon and i figur peopl were probabl at home abus their air condit  clear i was the onli one not do so place was quiet with quiet a few older folk eat here ahead of me in line

it a buffet style setup where you go and order your food pay then go sit down  they had a realli good select of choic in regard to meat select and im realli happi with their side  i went with the brisket sandwich but want garlic mash potato  me and my mash potato dammit  ugh they were out so i got potato slice and a thing of corn  total bill was just under 10  

but here the weird thing  first at the regist they offer me lemonad or ice teaor fountain pop for a 1 extra  i obvious went with the fountain pop for the extra dollar  also kudo to this place for have a varieti of sauc avail at the tabl for bbq dress  yes

also the area where you get your suppli onli has room for one tray when you go to get your pop along with your silverwar and everyth els kind of a tight squeez of there other peopl tri to get stuff at the same time you are might as well put your tray down and come back for drink and everyth els  place is well decor and easi to spot from the roadill be honest to say i dont frequent doughnut shop veri often not becaus i dont like doughnut i love them that is whi id probabl weigh 300 lbs

that be said onc in a blue moon ill allow myself to have a glaze chocol or some sort of sin gooeyfri dough this store is small they do have the basic popular choic and provid some beveragescoffe i do love support the local shop like ronald on the westsid but i felt kd was too small i feel like if im go to go for a doughnut id like to see a wonder huge varieti all of them tempt me to buy a dozen kds display was just aok their doughnut look petit and justordinary

i do wish i could give a 4star rate just for the kolach i tri a jalapeno sausag one which they did warm up for me that was a nice touch kick of spice warm and delici 249 i guess that decent

th employe who took my order was veri nice thank me for my busi and gave me a few free doughnut hole to go with the one i order 

id like to tri them again howev i dont feel id make the effort for the select they have if im in the area sure if im go to treat myself to a doughnut i think id prefer ronald for their doughnut choic valu and appealwent to kd donut on the 4th of juli pleas that they were open  glad to have proper expect for the kolach base on other review  

the mini kolach were tasti littl cheddarwurst sausag with a slice of chees wrap in a croissantlik bun  the old guy who bare spoke english warm them for us without our need to ask

w chose a varieti of donut yeast cake and fritter and found them all to be veri tasti  not the best weve ever had but a step abov the chain store for sure

main reason for the 3 star is cleanli  there were two dead cockroach visibl in the front area of the store and as our kolach warm in the microwav i notic two small fli bug buzz in the donut cabinet  we were abl to transact busi with the old guy who help us but he wasnt abl to answer ani of my question about the varieti of kolach on offerjava vega is the orlean coffe shop not to be confus with the cafe that replac seattl best and kate corner it is the place to go to for a quick cup of coffe in the orlean 

 at first i was disappoint to see this seattl best fold i actual appreci their coffe more than starbuck but thing happen when i saw the java vega sign at the orlean sister properti the sun coast i was kind of concern that i was in for inferior coffe when i reach the counter i saw the familiar green mermaid in other word java vega is a glorifi starbuck with a java vega banner 

  dure my staycat at the orlean i visit java vega twice with a locat near the hotel registr lobbi and surround by slot machin peopl flock to java vega the first time there was a long line and the second time their was a wait for an avail tabl java vega is well manag and the line move fast the busi employe were friend 

  although the tabl fill up at java vega it is a decent size room that overlook the casino it is a room of tabl and plush chair that incorpor the space of the former kate corner

  java vega is more than coffe they sell the tradit coffe cake and bagel sold at starbuck  just like starbuck their bagel need some work but java vega has start sell krispi kreme doughnut and a delici krispi kreme doughnut was a delici compliment to yesterday cafe americana

  be a las vega local i could see yelp checkin at java vega if i am in the orlean and need a caffein boost it realli a starbuck with decent price and krispi kreme doughnutnice place to get some breakfast or lunch in the pv mall area insid is somewhat simpl with the basic pig theme oink they have both booth and tabl that you can request get realli busi and you will probabl have to wait a bit so get there a littl earli and get your name on the list we went shop next door and got back right when they call our name perfect timing

th menu has a larg select of most of your favorit breakfast dish as well as a lunch menu with burger and sandwich they also serv soup an array of salad oatmeal yogurt with granola mac and chees chicken fish and chip and even chicken fri steak

today my yelp friend and i did the breakfast danc i order the the oink omelett which has 5 egg and is stuf with a bunch of the meat group cover with cheddar chees had to tri a side of the half flight of bacon which is 4 out of the 8 choic of flavor bacon strip and a side of what they call ranchero sauc for my omelette

our server cheyenn was both friend and most accommod even though the restaur was total pack she made sure that we had everyth we need and then some

th food was tasti yet somewhat averag and the bacon was a littl pricey would have like a thicker cut of the bacon as well as it be cook a littl slower to prevent shrinkag after all it is serv on a butcher block thick babi the omelett was tasti and quit fill what they call ranchero sauc is realli more of a new mexico style enchilada sauc ranchero sauc is usual more of a fresh sauc cook with tomato onion pepper garlic and herb i bet their version would tast great on one of their burrito option hmm

definit worth a visit when you are shop and get readi to drop open everi day from 7 am to 2pm enjoyin true rees fashion i show up late to the breakfast club shindig but the server onli let me sit there about 12 minut befor ask me if id like anyth to drink yes pleas water thank you oh and may i have a menu pleas imo i shouldnt have to ask for that she should have brought it over when she realiz i was new to the tabl whatev i wasnt realli realli hungri yet anyway 

i look over the menu and by the time she deliv my water i had alreadi decid on the egg plate with jalapeño bacon the food was pretti bland i dous it in pepper and chollula and a bit of salt also if your gimmick is bacon you had better be damn good at it the jalapeño bacon was definit noth to write home about and a friend who had order the bacon flight was onli moder impress definit not worth the cost in this case oh well what are ya gonna do oh i know not order that again the french toast look yummi and if i live on this side of town i might bring my sonni man back for breakfast 

in conclus i feel the entir experi was simpli mediocramerican taco
pleas come to meee
american taco
papa let me bee
dont come hangin around my plate
i wanna see you in my belli not my face
american woman lyrics

america taco shop is actual name after a woman name america not our countri america  america corral and her husband creat this popular chain restaur in sever state and luckili phoenix was one of them  vote best phoenix mexican food by phoenix magazin in 2011 this taco shop definit has a reput of provid some pop and zing

i order the al pastor vampiro while my sister order the carn asada burrito  the vampiro were marin in a sauc that remind me of the chines bbq pork yeah pretti weird but overal i didnt think it was the kind of vampiro i was think about  i thought it fill my belli that about it  my sister realli like the food here and her burrito was veri good in her opinion  we order a side of chip and salsa along with our food  i had to add some extra spice to get some kick in the salsa  

america taco shop is home cook recip at a fast food pace  thus you order at the counter and the food is brought out  you can also place your order onlin which i thought was pretti cool  the place itself is a dive and diner feel with a modern gloss  one thing brought to my mind stainless steel  like a modern kitchen this place is cover with stainless steel  

i would say overal experi of this place is good  i didnt realli love it but i would definit come back becaus of it uniqu twist to mexican food that im usual accustom to  enjoysora vs monta

sora is the new inhabit of the fail whale spot on spring mountain mani restaur shut down in this build befor them like monta they serv authent japanes ramen but in tradit sapporo style 

order miso is all i eat at monta so i figur id compar what i know i dont like to litter my bowl with addit top a regular bowl is serv with a perfect cook 12 egg scallion menma bamboo shoot and 1 larg slice of chashu pork the usual addon like corn butter nori etc are available

broth  the broth at sora is quit greasi as soon as they place my bowl down i was a littl turn off by how mani oil floati there were when i make broth at home i alway take the time to skim off the fat but in tradit sapporo style they boil pork bone for mani hour and the oil is part of what make the broththi just isnt my style it left greas on my lipsalso not my style what i love about monta is how creami the broth is here the broth is more clear and lack a certain heavi that i appreci from a bowl of ramen flavor between monta and sora are similar it just the littl thing that count to me

noodl sapporo noodl are thicker and chewier you can immedi see the differ in the weight of the noodl im use to fullycook noodl wherea the one here have more bite to them and are serv a bit al dent i like

chashu i wish it was serv with more next time ill probabl order extra chashu for the extra 2 it as slice quit thin and veri tender i didnt see much of a flavor differ from monta

varieti i believ i saw fri rice on the menu they had some mini curri and mini chasu bowl avail as appet i wish they had some type of fresh appet i realli like my minimentaiko bowl with my ramen at ramen instead i went with the gyoza theyr fri dumplingsc mess those up

drink liquor licens pend sapporo beer will soon be avail they have can green tea and other usual beverages

servic great my server was such a nice guy veri polit and attent i like to dine solo and dont like to be bother too much they fulfil my need while not annoy me to death 

overal i prefer monta but i wont rais ani red flag on the food here

dont forget to rate  follow in comparison to the mani ramen joint i have had this one definit fell short  the best i can say is it was still good for what it was  i would not turn down a bowl here if i had no other choic  i still enjoy it for the most part  

one posit is they do offer various flavor broth  second they offer cheap 23 mini rice bowl that you typic see at ramen joint  you can order that as a side item to compliment your slurp meal  third there are various top like corn that you can add as an extra cost

usu when i tri a place for the first time i alway attempt the classic flavor so that it serv as a basi for compar to other place  so i elect for the chashu bowl in shio style salt  unlik my favorit place the flavor was not as pop  when you eat ramen the broth has to shine  i would say it was mediocr at best  the noodl themselv was also differ from what im use to  a posit note howev is the slice chashu pork was pretti good  

the mini rice bowl i got to tri were the grill pork and grill pork with curri  both tast veri good and easili finish if you are hungri  

there was a wait for my group but it was not terribl  the joint is kind of small  the servic was pretti friend and attent  also they yell like real japanes  arrigato sora for a 3star experivegetarian perspective

so upon see a veri cool show call recycl percuss my friend alida shout out and i decid to get some grub 
it was her pick so tis all her fault haha kidding

pros

great park space
easi to find directionally
friend service
cheap ill take qualiti over price ani day
beauti ambiance
seat yourself vibe with casual attire
etc

neg

ha to do with show up with an empti stomach but open mind and think it ramen i love ramen not a vegan so there bound to be someth alida was kind enough to initi the question of what do you have for veg respons noth noth for vegetarian

i do high appreci that the waitress knew her menu and communic that to me honest upon an awkward shall we leav look she offer to have a dish of fri rice  egg no pork custom made and it was delici just suck be hungri 


but hey it was a good meal reason price alida enjoy her dish and she is not allow to choos the next restaur  haoh what some time and eat can do to an opinion i will prefac this with the obvious this is a matter of tast and prefer you may come here and simpli fall in love

 i dont like that they skimp on noodl here biggest issu i have with them by far im also a fan of thinner over thicker for ramen noodl i havent had ani yet here

 i  dont like the style of broth  no punch to me it just about suitabl for chicken noodl soup  not ramen i dont even like the color of it i know though that is just my prefer mayb ramen is like this in hokkaido i dont know i havent been yet

 i think their chashu is good tender and larg cuts

 i like the option avail for type of broth as well as the various option for thing like pile of chashu or a surround dress of nori mayb your extra hungri and want a huge bowl instead of those sissi regular one youv got choices

id say this if you like rich pork flavor this is not for you if you like thin noodl this is not for you if you like a lighter ramen experi  you may just find your call here after allyes kathi is backin the former bird and bonz bbq spot across from wo fat chines restaur shes pumpin out her louisiana style southern cook on our visit we stop by for dinner and were surpris to see and hear that near all of the patron  were happi to find her again or thought she had gone out of business

thi new spot is definit  clean and the kitchen area isnt cramp up like her former locat the dine area is much smaller with onli about 6 tabl 
anoth good chang is that the price have drop and arent outrag anymorer was definit higher in henderson which is probabl the reason of the high price befor kathi is there with her husband and her soni think who is the fri chicken master

of cours we had to get the fri chicken dinner and endur the 20minut wait we also share the bbq rib and asid from the corn bread we got mac and chees cole slaw yam and mash potato and gravi sinc they were out of potato salad the rib were okay as was the side the cornbread was a littl dri but the chicken was definit worth the wait crispi skin and hot  juici in everi biteyou get a breast thigh and a wing for dessert we got a slice of sweet potato pie and the banana pud pie was a littl overkil on the spice and the banana pud was alright i would probabl return for the chicken

gon are the addit fee and they do take plasticanoth thing i notic is they give refil on tea and lemonad but charg for punch hawaiian punchgiv them a tri and see what you thinkit ton better than ella em that for surealoha

yelp 365 challenge164365 kathi backi am take away some star from my first review the food here is still fabul but the servic is lack   i have been here 56 time sinc they have open and for some reason the last time the servic was not that great   the music was also way too loud   we ask if it could be turn down just one notch and the respons  ha i can ask but i serious doubt it   my profess is ear and hear this place was way too loud to enjoy a convers and our order was even mess up becaus the server most like could not hear due to the loud  yike    when all the door and window are close due to the summer heat turn down the music  let peopl enjoy each other    
the food is great but i fear this busi is get the peopl love us so we dont have to care attitud     

i am done with postino east for a whilefirst thing firsti went in with an open mind and an empti stomachnot a lot of
5star review from a hand of yelp friend i began to thinkar we miss out on other ayc joint is my usual spot slip like they say it is is sushi koma that good onli one way to find outgo

quesadilla was good but kinda skimpi on the brie and grape amaebi was plump and sweet sashimi roll was good and i like the addit of the garlic chip on the carpaccio but didnt care that it was swim in the sauc uni didnt arrive

nigiri was up next salmon scallop and hamachi were good the saba was except and i kill about 6 order alon still no uni so our waitress remind the chef we assum that the uni is on it way and we go with a few rollseleph one with beef on top and one with soft shell crab forgot the name but overal roll were forgett the eleph was okay the beef roll was bare evid becaus the overkil on the green onion and eel sauc and the textur on the soft shell crab was almost non exist from be fine chop i like to bite into the bodi leg or claw when i order anyth with soft shell crab know what i mean

 our waitress was still surpris we didnt get our uni and in korean she and the chef were go back and forth for an awkward moment and after 5 minut our chef reassur us that the uni was comingdont know what happen there but mayb he was save the best for last got to devour the 4 piec of uni which were veri sweet and we order up dessert

mor of our visit the sushi isnt alway greener on the other sidealoha

yelp 100 challeng 201352100 komatosi ate here last night with eric r and toni t and then onc a year ago around this time  a year ago eric r call and reserv seat at the sushi bar onc he confirm the texa footbal game was on tv so we came to dine and watch footbal  last night we got there around 645 pm on a sunday night and it was veri pack except for 4 sushi bar spot open by the door  the host told us 2 were reserv and sinc we were a parti of 3 we could wait for other to finish  that was fine  later the host said the peopl who made the reserv were not come so we could sit there

soon 3 peopl got up from the bar further into the restaur so we ask to sit there away from the door  the male serverchef said sure so we went to sit there but the host then said the reserv sign on the first seat that we were not allow to sit on now must be move to the other side of the bar becaus those custom like seat 1 and 2 even though she said they were not come  the male serverchef and the host argu and final we were allow to sit away from the door  after we were seat the whole bar clear and no one show up for the reserv so all of that was annoying

onc seat we tri a lot of differ thing  i had ice green tea which was nice and grassi  the standout for me were the mackerel and the ika with shiso leaf  they were so good that i order them twice  the mackerel was perfect cure  not dri too meati or fishi top with grate ginger and chop negi  the squid was veri fresh and not too chewi  i realli enjoy both of these the most  the whole scallop sushi was realli fresh too

th pretti good item were the hamachi we got belli cut on request with serrano pepper salmon nigiri tako uni amaebi some were miss tail and we request the head after and they were veri small and oili but tast okay  eric r and toni t had some thing i did not tri includ surf clam halibut escolar unagi maguro tamago masago with quail egg and ikura  they both had the teriyakibulgogi beef which was actual almost exact like gyudon and pretti tasti  i also had a yellowtail jalapeno handrol which was fine

th bad toni t and i both order salmon skin temaki earli in the meal  the chef tri to discourag us becaus it take at least 10 minut  i did not mind becaus it is normal to wait for the skin to baketoast so we said sure  well when it came out i heard toni crunch his a littl but all of the skin and there was a lot was just raw fat and skin not hot or cook at all  i pull all of it out and put it on a plate and show the chef  i did not want anoth one but i want him to know this was unaccept so he did not serv it to anyon els  he apolog and said he should have check it befor serv but this was not his fault but whoever made it in the kitchen  i did not want anoth one and a server snatch it out of my hand and whisk it away  toni t also order sear tuna carpaccio which the restaur initi forgot and when it was deliv it look kind of like cat food  he said it was veri salti  for dessert the ayc say onli one mochi but eric r order 2 without ani issu  i got plum wine ice cream which tast exact like bubblegum ice cream and it was nasti  dont do it  i should just stick with my uni as dessert policy

overal it satisfi our sushi crave in the area sinc taiga and 808 tapa were close but i would not rush back  i would definit recommend a stop here for saba and ika lover though becaus they were pretti great  also i second drew a on the price  if you do not do ayc you end up pay bizarr price like 9 for a tini bowl of the beef  the nigiri is price almost 2 higher per order than other a la cart place too  the chef were friend but swamp and it was veri hard to order anyth becaus they did not often look up at anyon at the bar which was sunken  drink were refil often and the servic was otherwis veri good  open til 3 am even on sundaythe price at this starbuck locat on the floor of the excalibur casino are ridicul inflat but i expect that consid it locat  it cost 625 for a venti latt and 4 for a slice of lemon loaf or a cinnamon roll and you dont even get point for be a gold card member  i onli stay in the excalibur hotel for one night but i purchas three or four drink from this starbuck dure that time and one from the starbuck upstair  there was onli a line onc while i was there but they actual kept us move pretti quick through it  my standard order is a littl involv  a grand decaf americano with three inch of steam breve and 4 pump of sugar free vanilla syrup but they made them perfect for my friend and i everi time

i had a slice of lemon loaf one day and a cinnamon roll the next and both were wonder  i have a friend who work at a differ starbuck who told me that all their pastri come in frozen and they thaw them to sell  it a littl hard to believ that the cinnamon roll had ever been frozen as it was rather tasti  there were some small cafe tabl to sit at between the starbuck and the poker tabl  the worker were friend enough though not over perky

th locat was handi for those want someth a littl stronger than the free drink the casino hand out but with an opposit effectoh sol i want to like you  we decid on this restaur becaus our friend want to be nearbi sinc they just had a babi  i read the review and check their websit so i was veri excit and hope i made a reserv becaus i knew this could be a zoo  the place is veri nice they made a lot of chang from the old parc  i hope they get their act togeth howev it is not onli the servic but food is lack tast that bring custom back over and over  for a while i am sure it will be pack sinc it is typic of scottsdal to go to the newest place and the sheep all flock to the scene to see and be seen but i digress  we order our drink and wait and wait my friend then told me wow the drink sure take a long time  final they came  my hubbi had the partida margarita with muddl jalapeño they were nice to do it sinc he doesnt like cucumb on his drink  our friend also had margarita one hous and one regular partida  i decid for the orin swift the prison now one of my favorit  the drink were veri good and that is what earn them the extra star  as for the food here we go  my hubbi had the taco vampiro wow so underwhelm for a small 675 taco  i dont mind pay for great food but this was noth special  he also had the chicken emolada which were ok  our friend jeff had the short rib barbacoa en cazuela  i had a littl tast of the meat and it was almost bland  i had the baja seafood cocktel tast was super bland and the seafood was overcook and so chewi i felt i was eat rubber  i ad some of the salsa that was on the tabl and it still didnt get that much flavor    i also had the ensalada sol well this is noth special ton of iceberg lettuc 5 12 inch piec of mango and 5 12 inch piec of avocado we had to request glass of water a coupl of time onc to our server and anoth to the woman that seem to be walk around everi so often   will i come back mayb for drinkkoothai is in the heart of titti town surround by strip club toy store and internet model spot you have a veri chic thai restaur erot citi need someth to eat other than beaver 

the decor is cool and my favorit touch is the glasswar i felt like a baller drink my water out of this heavi ass glass real kool the restaur was immacul too

th food i cant say im in love or in lust with ani of it my panang beef had a decent flavor not near enough heat for my like and the meat cut was that of a birkenstock sandal yes i had two pair dont judg i had to grace spit out more than three piec of  beef i also sampl a few of the other dish ginger dish not bad the tofu and noodl were far too soft the jungl curri sound like an adventur right nope food was a huge miss for me which i am pretti sad about not kool

th servic was outta the park 5 star i love our waiter who is probabl the owner and dishwash and waiter he was so generous with the thai tea which was fat kid fuck delici he kept come back and check on us etc hes real kool

overal i cant even say i will be back after my wild night at the strip club i cant say eat is the first thing on my mind if i work as a stripper down the street i would probabl be on the blow and vodka diet and koolthai doesnt have either no liquor licens not kool this jedi will not be returning

koolthai i still want you to make it and hope the cop keep fill your fli joint up sorri for the 3 star but i just had to keep it realwith yelp deal in hand we order some pizza and wing for my fella famili so we could all watch the playoff game togeth we werent veri hungri after a pretti extravag meal earlier in the day but were still excit to tri a new place for pizza in town 

we order two extra larg pepperoni pizza and a 24 piec of hot wing for carryout we arriv about 20 minut later and our food was readi for us we paid and were on our way on the car ride over to the fam hous the food smell great the pizza travel well and they pack it realli well everyon was realli happi with the pizza and the wing they werent the best i had everi had but they were solid and for the price with the yelp deal and also the groupon we have ill be back to check out the pasta and sandwich assort they have on their menu overal it a good spot for takeout if your in the areai came here today with my fella becaus i had recent purchas the groupon 

the menu is pretti simpl i like the concept of green food but i wasnt entir impress with ani of the flavor the meat was definit tasti and fresh you can tell although i wasnt in the mood for a burger so end up order a grill chees with jalapeno that was probabl a mistak on my part they have vegetarian and vegan patti option as well which im intrigu by 

the fri were fresh but i wasnt a fan of the flavor im not typic a big fan of fri and these just werent cut it for me mayb im just too use to process food hope that not the case they have a great concept and mayb just need to work through the kink the servic was definit fantast we alway had someon ask if we need anyth and ask if we were enjoy our meal 

i dont know how motiv i am to go out of my way to return but it a good option if your in the areacame here with a groupon 10 for 20 worth of food  we went on a saturday afternoon and the ratio of staff to custom was a 3 to 1  that just mean incred servic 

here is our 20 worth of food
a one beef patti burger kid burger with a slice of age cheddar chees top with other condiments
a two patti burger with a slice of age cheddar chees elev sauc and other condiments
an order of fries
a blueberri shake
a drink

th slice of age cheddar cost a quarter per slice  there wasnt much flavor to it for my tast  the staff doe come by from time to time to see if we are do good 

the end of our meal the question we ask ourselv is is it better than in n out  our respons no

lov the concept but in n out is still our preferon my first visit i thought the burger were under season the second visit confirm it

a standard elev burger is two patti two slice of chees they also have singl patti burger and cheeseburg avail along with two type of veggi burgers

their main sell point that differenti them from the competit is their 100 usdacertifi organ grassf freerang i like the beefi and juici of the patti but they have a distinct tast that unlik your typic fast foodfast casual burger if they just season them more they would be so much better the bun are soft and chewi the fri are good and the top are divers  includ their tangi elev sauc a balsam mustard and 6month age cheddar cheese

their larg cooki isnt so larg it a chocol chip oatmeal pecan cooki that shape like a small hockey puck it doe howev pack a tasti punch

if your lactos intoler i wouldnt recommend their chocol shake it pretti much melt ice cream that incred rich and creamy

mi kid wasnt a fan of their grill chees they take their hamburg bun turn them upsid down and place chees in between them not tradit by ani mean and not a hit with my four year old

their staff has been friend and inform on my visit  alway will to answer ani question  and the interior is reminisc of chipotl but lighter

a expect it pricier becaus of all the organ sustain ingredi all that stuff make for a good sale pitch but in the end it come down to tast and that where they fall short i still prefer innout or even smashburg if im go to get fast foodhate to be the one that give a new busi a bad review but i feel it necessari to share my experience

so 3pm cafe is a new taiwanes tea hous furnish heavili by ikea item with snack and minim entre tea are base off either black or green and then flavor accord and come in a fair size glass jar top includ the usual such as boba and jelli although at the moment they do not have jelli in stock everyth is under 10 and you get a 10 discount with your unlv id there is also free wifi and i believ theyr open until 1am

now the bad the servic definit need work walk in my group went up to the regist to place an order but was told to go to the tabl  to sit down and get our order taken although other peopl werent turn down at the counter when order servic was realli awkward and took multipl awkward look with the wait staff to get our order place two egg and spam instant noodles495 and a minc pork 725 over rice took about 25 minut to come out had to ask for silverwar kind of hard to eat instant noodl with a soup spoon haha food need to be revis the two slice of spam were not even cut straight and the minc pork over rice well was probabl 90 rice and 10 minc pork a bit pricey at 725 a third spam and egg instant noodl also came out for my friend who came late and never order one 

drink came out at the same time even though they were order 10 minut apart and came with the thick straw without plastic wrap would not be a huge issu if it wasnt for two of the worker cough in their hand at least cough in your elbow the guy make the drink was also drink the leftov from the drink mixer i dont mind if you want the leftov but at least pour it into a cup 

overal organ is definit need for improv a pos system and sorri to say but a review on the district health card movie

edit
bump up from 2 star to 3 because

i was contact by someon who work there and they claim to of wash their hand after they cough and onli drink the leftov to check on the tast i didnt see but it best to give them the benefit of the doubtwho unlv studentsalumni or peopl just around the area and crave a drank with boba

wher on maryland parkway between tropicana  flamingo right next to cafe rio yessss dessert

when they are still fair new so i believ they are test out their hour as of the last time ive gone there

whi if you need a break from all that studi if you need a place to studi if you want to meet a friend and chitchat if your for some reason thirstier than normal if you want to tri someth new or if you just want to be there

what i am so glad that there is now a boba cafe direct across the street from school there are time where i crave a nice cold boba drink and i now can fulfil my crave and run across the street of cours look both way befor cross and obtain that delici drink

both time i walk into the place it was slower than i was expect probabl becaus the time ive been there were both after 6pm howev everi time i step foot i was delight greet the worker there are so friend you can actual convers with them  they strict had boba drink onli but their menu state other this is becaus they will be get their food stuff soon which im extrem excit for if they havent gotten it all in alreadi the menu look awesom though be prepar for anoth asian fusion hot spot

in the meantim enjoy what avail and i will updat as soon as i get the chanc to go back there d       chutney lunch buffet       

i hesit to say that this review is for the weekend lunch buffet as it struck me as about the same as the weekday version that ive had at least twice here except for the 2 higher price  there was a lamb dish out which may be a weekend onli item


yays

  beauti dine rooms

  delici helpyourself mango juice

  hot indian tea

  small dosa brought to the tabl  i prefer it to the one with the huge bread part you usual get at place that serv one

  food most good  the lamb curri chicken tikki masala  the chicken pepper masala were all tasti for exampl  i thought the tandoori chicken was just ok


info

  dish tend toward somewhat spici  i wouldnt say hot

  everyth was the right temperatur except the naan bread

  fair generous select for an indian buffet  32 item includ dosa juic tea  count salad item separ but not includ sauc  dress 

  at the top of the price rang for weekend indian buffets


nays

  here they are tri to be an upscal restaur  yet theyr still use super tacki littl styrofoam cup for you to put the sambar rasam  other soupi food in  these thing shouldnt be seen anywher except mayb at the jail or the homeless shelter  so just as both time befor i ask for sever small real bowl to put food in  just as both time befor the host had a stori for me about how the bowl were in the back be polish  then eventu he brought me out 3 dinki littl ceram squar thing to put a tablespoon or so of soup in  remark my dosa show up in a real bowl which i tri to hide when i got up for ten second but he found it  ran away 100kph with it     o

  that wasnt the end of the styrofoam  that also all they had for the mango juic  the indian tea  other valley indian buffet that serv these two nice treat provid real glass for the juic  real mug for the tea  here it was jailhomeless styrofoam cup just a littl bigger than the soup ones

  the naan bread  the best indian buffet in the valley offer you a choic between garlic flavor or plain which usual mean light butter  in ani case it come in a basket hot to your tabl  here it was plain onli noth on it  just lay out at room temperatur in the serv area  aysm     o

al in all and at 1295  3 star bare     an indoor farmer market  great idea  i met tiffani r here for some walk around and nibbl yesterday a fine friday morn  she was slurp on some tart her prefer juic blend  we meander in the old bus termin look at exot like finger lime and lemon cucumb  we stop at a spicetea booth a sconecak booth sampl beet hummus and hydropon basil pesto and had a nice time exploring

i end up buy the largest squash blossom on earth from gilcreas orchard which i stuf with goat cheeselemon rindonionsscallionslemon juic concoct befor fri up in a cornmeal batter today they onli last up to 2 day so i had to eat them quick  they were onli 5 for 12 huge blossom  what a deal  we also stop by artisan food littl outlet here they have some odd flavor snow cone and i order a 2 cup of cucumb mint green tea unsweeten  at arizona tamal compani i tri a sweet corn tamal with salsa verd for 5 pricey for one but tasti nonetheless  tiffani and i found a taiwanes bakeri booth where we both got green onion pancak 3 which turn out to be cold and rubberi rather than warm and flaki  she also got a veri tart lemonad for 2  

the pick are a tad slim but they were definit interest and sometim unusu  we enjoy hang out here  plenti of seat insid to eat and a few food truck park outsid near picnic tabl  i also like the farmer market at henderson pavilion on friday but that one is outsid ayiyi

fre park next to the bus termin on stewart  casino center or just park at a garag and valid insid i park at the california  dont forget your reusabl bag4 star for coffe it good it cheap i have them make it with extra cream and 3 splenda i especi like the hazelnut one

2 star for their breakfast item i rare come here but everytim i do i forget the disappoint i had with whatev breakfast item i order last time serious they all suck and mayb if i put it in write mayb i will final rememb to pass up the food next time kinda like type out my note when i was in school that help me quit a bit we shall see

th egg is that disgust premad preform stuff the bacon is skimpi and the chees look like it was melt like yesterday shame on me for let this happen at least 3 or 4 time now ill tri to rememb to just stick with the coffethe day has come in which southern california has a golden corral within a reason drive distanc  no more drool over those entic commerci onli to go onlin and googl that the nearest golden corral to be 100 mile away  

after have had both lunch and dinner here i think i can say this buffet is a better version of hometown buffet but noth that special  mayb ive just been spoil by all those las vega buffets

what i dont like about the place  first off i dont like have to start off at the drink machin and carri my drink while wait in line then carri my drink all the way to the tabl  and then when at the tabl when i run out of soft drinkcoffeeteawat i need to flag down a waiter in order to get a refil  whi  becaus onc insid the actual buffet the onli dispens are oper by server onli fail  second the actual buffet area is poor design  i never know who is in what line becaus often time line fuse togeth  third and most import a lot of what golden corral advertis on tv is not at this restaur  perhap becaus this is just start out  but i felt the select wasnt as great as it should be

what i do like  even though a lot of item go fast all you have to do is let someon know and theyll be nice and tri to replac that item as quick as possibl  the server are friend as well as the buffet staff which make for a nice dine experi  food is what you can expect of a standard buffet  some item tast better than other but noth is go to blow your sock off  just decent food for an okay price

al in all would i come here again  sure i would but probabl at the same frequenc that i visit someplac like hometown buffet which is realli 23 time a year if even that  there is no reason that peopl should be dream about golden corral anymor  here it is folk and believ me after stop by this isnt someth you will be crave formy motto at a buffet take almost embarrass small portion of each dish so that you can tri everyth 

there was no line at 830 in the am price was onli 9 for allyoucaneat buffet everyth was pretti good 

here what i ate and im proud of it
fresh waffle
fri chicken there two kind get the one with the smoother look batter
smoki sausag 
grit with brown sugar and butter
oatmeal
eggs
fresh fruit
slic of boysenberri pie
coffee

do not mean i took fat ass portion of each like some patron were do then wast the food to go up and get other item that just disgust and irrespons eat practic i think etiquett and portion control is outofcontrol the amount of wast food is incred at buffet 

this place was decent for the price it was probabl a better experi sinc my grandpar are in town and my brother was here tell interest stori my famili rock for exampl in refer to a wed were attend this afternoon my 80 year old grandpa just said open bar i can drink a lot of beer in 5 hour hahah

park larg privat lot can fill up dure peak hour but space are pretti largwhat in the world  i felt like i was wait for a ride at disneyland with the long and ridicul line

leonard w and i alway see commerci for golden corral and even thought about stop by victorvill next time we head to vega but what do you know a golden corral open in 626

we got there around 1120am and we were greet with this loooong line out the door  turn out this place also serv breakfast so there a crowd sinc morn  the outsid portion took a good 20 minut befor we got into the door think that we are get closer to food but realiti slap us in the face and the line actual curl a few time like at disneyland befor you head toward the regist to pay  final after a total of 4050minut of wait we were seat and we began to explor the buffet

ther a salad station mexican chines southern grill station small seafood section and a big dessert section  the standout for us was definit the mandarin chicken and the fri chicken  we love the mandarin chicken becaus it isnt drench in sauc and they actual stir fri it with chines ferment black soybean  it add a differ flavor to your normal orang chicken and we ate a ton of those  

now the fri chicken was ridicul juici  good season on the outsid and we thought that onli the dark meat was gonna be juici but even the breast meat was awesome

aft those two item though we didnt care too much about the other  they had pork chop for lunch instead of sirloin steak  they also had slider but a littl inconsist  our first slider were great but slider after were all overcook  pizza pot roast chicken fajita cajun fish and fri catfish were a few item that i tri and they were all alright

th weirdest thing on the menu was fri chicken gizzard  that was interesting

didnt tri much of the dessert but the cooki were extrem butteri yum and they got some legit legit mint chocol chip ice cream  of cours there was the famous chocol fountain but kid were hog up that area so i didnt bother with it

servic was a standout  our server had this southern hospitalityqu to him and just from watch him interact with other tabl i can tell this guy is gonna get a lot of tips

for 829 it not bad at all for buffet  it doesnt includ a drink so if you add a drink it cost about the same or a littl more than hometown and i gotta say golden corral is waaaay better than hometownthe food is good for the price 1095  drink the qualifi of the food is pretti good the steak station was awesom steak ani way you want whether you want medium rare medium etc the salad station veri fresh  the servic is great the waitress come and clean up often and refil your drink for you

major con the wait is around 2 hour long be prepar to wait for a veri long time and dont get too anxious onc you get insid there anoth 30 minut wait insidlet me start with the silverwar theyr not clean luckili they had packag dispos fork knive and spoons

i usual dont eat steak becaus i like it dri and burnt surpris it was cook right to my like no pink babi that probabl the highlight of my meal that and the fresh bake yeast roll so yummi you dont need the extra butter to mess it up green bean  were can and overcook the fri chicken didnt have enough flavor the shrimp had too much bread and the fountain drink seem to be on their last leg i now know whi kid hate brussel sprout they were horrible

i almost forgot the cheddar chees biscuit were good i love chocol but sad their chocol dessert offer from cake pie and the famous chocol fountain did not do it for me of cours on the way out who can resist the handscoop ice cream i had the butter pecan so creami i was so happi i left room for it

and no i will not talk about the restroom today someon been call me out on that a glorifi hometown buffet with surpris attent service

th you can do here

 check out the choco fondu and cotton candi machine
 eat the larger fri shrimp nearer to the salad bar than the popcorn shrimp found with the rest of the seafood selection

golden corral in las vega has been month in the make  previous to this one now the closest one is in hesperia ca which i have eaten at and review  silli me for take my famili to this new establish on grand open weekend  damn

th line was long  like allyoucaneat crab leg long  we were stand outsid for a good 30 minut befor we even reach the door  then it was anoth 15 minut wait through that line to get to the cashier  by the time the famili and i got to the front we were starv  

i do realiz come on an open weekend has it up and down  boy were there a lot of down this day  the place seem to be beyond capac all tabl were full of famili dine  with this tabl seem to be push even closer togeth to accommod more folk  our next tabl neighbor was liter no more than a foot or two from our tabl  talk about close quarter  but we manag to make due

lin for the entir buffet were crowd  bad but food was be replenish at a furious pace  good becaus fresh helps

aft get your silverwar and favorit color plate go ahead  blue green red yellow help yourself to endless amount of food  it not much differ than your averag buffet in las vega and the qualiti and quantiti end up be right in the middl of the pack  think  better than your local chines buffet but not up to par like wynn or bacchan  

there are three main section in golden corral

on the left is the salad bar 
on the right is the dessert bar
in the middl is your main dining

il give them credit their salad bar is pretti big for a buffet  i found all the make to make a decent chicken caesar salad as well a cobb salad  they even have bleu chees crumbl  

the main event at golden corral is good  they have a good variat of food on their dine line  you have food that go the spectrum

american
italian
mexican
asian

with american you get your fri chicken macaroni  chees catfish and grill item like steak and cheeseburg slider  yes slider  this is my main reason for come to golden corral  those damn slider  they are made of ground steak so the qualiti is actual veri good  i could eat a plate of these and a salad and be a happi man  line up for them though they usual go veri quick  that day the tray was constant be replac and halfway through our meal they ran out  good thing i stock up and grab one for each famili member  and an extra two or three for myselfhe hee  the catfish was also pretti good fri fresh so they were crispi and not too oili  i also enjoy the fri chicken as long as they were either leg or thigh piec  the breast are a bit on the dri side

th other food area were just ok  i didnt carb out with the pasta or pizza from the italian station and the item in the mexican station were a bit bland  realli golden corral you need to improv your asian station  just like the one in hesperia not all asian food has bean sprout  ugh  but at least your sesam chicken dish was decent

th dessert area seem to be the biggest attract for a lot of folk especi kid  come on cotton candi  are you serious  the onli other buffet here that might decid to offer it one day would be the wynn the buffet of fanci dessert  so yes everyon and their mama had a cotton candi at some point of their meal  anoth big thing at golden corral is their high advertis chocol fountain  in fact they have three  milk chocol white chocol and caramel  great have your kid dip candi in more candycan you say diabet  oi

i do keep it simpl on dessert there i like a scoop of ice cream yes they have breyer or dreyer and their banana pud  so easi but oh so good  who knew  

price at golden corral hover around other buffet in our area 8 rang for lunch and 11 rang for dinner  we went on a weekend and hit some kind of all day dinner period so we paid the dinner price  it was near worth it but the crowd realli detract from the experi  henc the 3star rate  i will be back but probabl not for a while until the line die out a littl bit

but good show golden corral  welcom to the buffet capit of the westwith ani luck youll cross the portal of this feedingfrenzi funhous and not have to wait in line outdoor along the sidewalk a common sight on weekend even at golden corral citi of industry

th home stretch of the line just befor the pay counter is equip with beverag dispens pepsi product and a choic of drink cup to fill befor your seat  meanwhil the in scurri about the dine room floor mani head to the grill for steak pork rib or carv ham and roast turkey

a hectic and daunt as the insid action might appear it surpris toler onc you get your plate and utensil  line form along the grill and dessert station but the employe behind the window attend to diner quick and after a few minut those area are sometim clear

whi is the corral like a funhous  main due to the wonderfal dark whitechocol and caramel fondu fountain handscoop ice cream and cottoncandi dessert  this prove to be a huge draw for famili and group celebr birthday that distinguish the buffet from it competitors

howev the steak is subsizzl in qualiti and fri chicken tast great but is most dri  mash potato are realli real and it tray empti quick as doe the pot roast and veget nearbi  coleslaw at the salad bar is chop and tast like kfcs familiar recipe

golden corral hasnt yet establish a domin presenc in california so the locat it doe have goos by nation advertis often seen on cabl tv program are focal point for hearti eater from mile around

th compani might also unwit boost revenu of nearbi restaur that captur the runoff of potenti custom who demur in favor of a more seren time mealtim  chili was the beneficiari on my first corral attemptbuild it and they will come yes they built it and they came alright iron a home depot is right next to it i gotta give gc some credit for their concept is pretti straightforward with hundr of buffet all around vega anoth one isnt gonna hurt right after have dinner here tonight becaus of my father in law birthday choic i would say the aok rate of 3 star was pretti much spot on

so befor i relay my experi let me get the necess out of the way

lunch 859 mon thru fri 1030 am to 4 pm
dinner 1189 mon thru sat 4 pm to close sun 11 am to close

senior 60 and over
sam as adult but 799 for breakfast and lunch 
dinner is 1099

none of these price includ drink which is anoth 199 for a plastic tumbler 250 for a larg to go cup water there is no charg so rememb the origin price is just for the food so dinner turn out to be a littl over 15 buck per adult becaus waterjust aint gonna cut it

everi day there is a differ theme so for monday it was seafood night sorri peep crab leg aint one of them you did have popcorn shrimp bread shrimp bread white fish bread clam strip and stuf crab none of which blew me away but at the same time was not bad mean it was edible

of cours the the main featur was the grill area where sirloin steak were be grill kudo to the design of the layout for all gcs becaus of the fact that you can see and smell what was be cook on the grill surround that grill area are side that you would typic see accompani main entre like saute mushroom onion green pepper etc

just to the right of the grill are where most of the item peopl start form line for like mash potato fri okra all the abov seafood item and lot of other that you just have to see for yourself one section that is guarante not to have a line is the salad bar section 

if you refer to my one plate of food i pretti much got a littl bit of everyth i want put togeth some key note to mention the onli thing that realli stood out for me were the yeast roll the fruit in the salad bar section and the dessert section 

the yeast roll are some of the best i have had in while they are good by themselv but when you put a littl bit of butter on them man watch out i can easili eat 3 of those without even blinking

a for the award for the least amount of attent goe to the salad bar section yeah i know nobodi realli goe to a buffet to eat salad you would be surpris though i thought some of the fruit and veget they had there were pretti fresh and crisp the actual veggi that you can put togeth to make your own salad can almost rival sweet tomato or soup plantat for you californians

th dessert section is commend for it has a wide select of differ form of sugar for you sweet tooth individu from ice cream soft serv cotton candi rice crispi marshmellow etc

notic i didnt mention the chocol waterfal they had what look like caramel white chocol and milk chocol i know it all sound like a good thing base on descript and actual see it in person is awesom too but here where the skid sound come in when you see a car slam it brake as i was look to see what item to select and mayb dip in chocol this littl kid come out of nowher pick his nose stick his finger into the chocol waterfal and proceed to put it in his mouth it happen so quick that i dont think anybodi els saw it but me onli problem is that when i replay it in my head it in slow motion so i get the full effect of what he did

so take heed in my dessert experi i wouldnt wanna go dip anyth in the chocol for you dont know what unknown thing is float around in there also the bathroom onli has two stall and has 3 urin you would think that a buffet would have the same amount of stall or at least more becaus of the fact that it a buffet bottom line is that you get decent food select at a decent price i would rank this place a notch abov home town buffet

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 101 chocol cover booger for the winafter a week of soso meal in vega i was look forward to a fantast meal thursday even  gordon ramsay steak in the pari was just open and my guest and i luck out in get a seat for dinner in the loung  

upon enter through the redlit tunnel i was impress by  the restaur strike design we were escort to our tabl and quick read through the mouthwat menu  for an appet we order the sear ahi tuna  for entre we order the beef wellington and the beef short rib 

although the entre were truli 5starworthi we found the tuna to be absolut and shock flavorless  when we inform our server she respond by say oh realli  later a bus boy came to remov our appet plate  when he notic that we had bare touch our 22 appet he ask how it was  i told him it was near flavorless  he said that he had alreadi heard the same from three other tabl  he remov the dish and told us he would inform the chef  unfortun no one offer to substitut out anoth dish for the one we had barley touch  perhap the newli train staff just didnt know how to respond to guest not enjoy the food but i expect them to care at the veri least     

i incorrect assum that the dish would be remov from the bill  it wasnt  after finish the meal and pay i ask to speak with the manag  i explain the situat and explain that we had alreadi paid  she said she was sorri and to ask for her by name the next time we were in town  i believ she said her name was nicol  given my high expect for a restaur bear gordon ramsay name i was disappoint that she seem slight unconcern  i was shock that she didnt offer anyth besid an apolog 

although the entre definit met our expect i cannot give this restaur a better rate at this time  i realiz this wont be everyon experi but it certain was mine 

a five star restaur with one star servic get three star  

until we meet again gordon ramsay steaki know i know i have to be the onli person give this place lower than four or five star but hear me out first 

first id like to say that the chicken doe deserv the 5 star everyon has been give it so definit give it a tri it had the perfect amount of spice and juicy to make me want to eat more 

now the reason im onli give this place 3 star is becaus of servic servic is the most import thing to me when eat at ani restaur  upon arriv there there was a sign state that it would be open at 1 pm it was alreadi 115 and it still wasnt open the manag was still a bit rocki sinc it was the first week but i decid to stick it out becaus of the amaz chicken smell that would seep through everi time the door open flav want to be there to serv and cook our chicken for us which i thought was veri nice of him howev it did take about an hour and a half for him to arriv they gave us all book and he sign them and took pictur with the crowd which was realli cool 

when we final got to order i order the semihungri meal which consist of 2 piec of chicken two side and a drink for about 750 i am not a big fan of dark meat so i opt to spend an extra 150 to make my meal just white meat after i place the order i had to wait about 20 to 30 more minut for my order to arriv i took the order home and when i bit into the chicken i saw it was all dark meat 

i know it just 150 but i was hope to get my order correct after wait for so long the chicken was still delici and the side mac and chees and french fri were good howev i recommend let this place get settl down for a coupl week befor tri it out i will definit tri eat here again in the futur to see if i can add a coupl extra stari keep go back hope that the staff will eventu start to feel at home and begin to provid some level of servic sad it has not been the case which is the inspir behind this downgrad rate 

to be sure the food is still good the atmospher is still great and the crowd is still eclect  but the servic is actual get worse

thi place is far too small to have to wait forev to be refil or simpli even recogn especi if you are sit right there in front of the bartend sometim it actual feel as though they are purpos tri to avoid eye contact 

hey manag  this is vega we got hundr of bartend look for work it shouldnt be hard to find onesmashburg took over the spot in desert ridg previous occupi by fatburg  sinc i have an avers to restaur with fat in the name i was happi to see a new burger spot to try

so far the food is good  the menu offer an assort of burger chicken sandwich and side  i have enjoyed

 mushroom swiss burger  a flavor and juici beef patti garlic saute mushroom and swiss chees serv on an egg bun

 fri  nice and crisp season with sea salt

 haystack onion  onion string with a tangi dip sauc  if you like onion ring you will love these

whil the food is good and the servic is quick and friend the restaur itself kind of spoil the experi  it feel cramp insid weird layout of entrancelinecount and drink dispens and on both of my visit mani tabl need to be clean  trash can were stuf to near overflow and mani of the condiment bottl were empti  

i appreci that the staff is deliv order from the kitchen quick but take a few minut to wipe tabl and empti trash would make a big differ in the small space  nobodi like to sit down at a sticki tabl  

as the locat is so close to the movi theater i am sure i will give it anoth tri  hope i wont need to bring my own clorox wipei realli want to be blown away but i need to reserv judgement

you are greet at the door by some delight attract young women who are help and cheer in the extrem fembotariff not realli a problem you might say well yeah   mayb for guy who didnt grow up watch rerun of the stepford wive the model of femal obsequi serverdom can be taken too far and put them all in lbds with black stock and heel kinda nudg it even further toward the creepi and this is come from a guy who gleefulli enjoy topless bars

but anyway

w were escort to the openair bar up top which seem more than pleasant enough what with mister and the sort of premium outdoor furnitur youd see in a porn maven scottsdal mansion or chandler i order my martini from our server who in our presenc feign the sort of utter awe that brought to mind what must have possess indonesian cargo cult when they final greet cessna load with zippo lighter and nylon the martini was    well    it was alcohol it came as i order it

th appet consist of some wing with a slightlysweet slightlyhot sauc the sell point was that they were kinda french in some way that made them recal lolipop lolipop like a precoci littl girl might suck upon loli lolipop anyway i would rate them about a 6 or so on the wing scale

mi companion order the pimento popper and sent them back not impress enough to keep them around to del frisco credit they are veri generous about take back item youv found less than up to expect and our server was veri open about their polici the devil egg with truffl oil that follow were more palat but noth to write home about

so del frisco is in my hood and i would love to recommend it as a mustvisit but i am hold back a bit until a full dinner at this point i see it as an expenseaccount destin where i can take predomin male outoftown visitor to see some terrif lookingwait staff who will make them feel like elvi i dont see it as a datenight or happi hour hangout thus the three star i like good valu for datenight and happi hourim a huge fan of asian cuisin and i love me a good burger as well so when someon suggest the new bachi burger locat for dinner a coupl of week ago i didnt complain  we had a parti of four and show up for a later dinner 900ish on a wednesday night  the restaur was quiet but i instant like the ambianc and modern feel the hostess that greet us were not the most welcom or perhap they were confus sinc we ask if we could sit at a tabl that was vacant but hadnt been clean yet instead of sit elsewher  onc the seat situat was settl the staff was friendlyish but the servic itself was on the veri slow side

w were all pretti hungri so we order some app for the tabl to start with bachi pickl edamam and truffl parm fri  the pickl plate isnt ideal for share but the other made  up for it and our parti demolish both  for my entre i went for the bachi fish sandwich and ad shishito pepper  i happen to love shishito pepper but when ive had it at asian  intern inspir place befor it cook the shishito pepper on my sandwich was not  oh well  lesson learn i like shishito pepper best when it cook  the fish itself was cook to perfect and of cours the fluffi bun it was serv on compliment it well  it was fluffi and sweet

th other at the tabl had a mr miyagi burger a spici miso burger and a lone bird  everyon seem to enjoy their respect order  most of us had ice matcha green tea to drink

from what i hear this locat is fair new so they like just have to work through some kink with the servic  id definit be open to return in the futur onc that happen  if your crave a simpl burger or even someth a bit more creativ you cant go wrong with the food at bachi burgeractual 312 star becaus of the good servic and ultraclean appear of the restaurant

start off with the oxtail chili chees fri  i have never been a fan of oxtail becaus it is too fatti and i never like the way it look in karekar a filipino dish with stew oxtail plus red meat isnt a regular part of my diet i had to tast what everyon was rave about yumyum it had a nice flavor to it and the textur was meltinyour mouth good it absorb the chili flavor and color well the crispi of the fri was a good contrast to the tender of the meat for the sandwich i order the crusti crab it was a littl too much on the sweet side for me  the bun kind of remind me of hawaiian bread i kept wait for savori but never got it i felt a littl wire after dinner hmmm mayb that was becaus i had a vietnames coffe my partner got the peke style duck steam bun her main complaint is that it was dri i tast it and it was ok to me oh well she is a real picki eater  it must have been difficult to feed her when she was a child lol

gener eschew ground meat it was for myself someth beyond angus kobe and wagyu that brought me to the summerlin locat of local darl bachi burger on sunday though i will say from the start that the kiki burger order by my mother was potenti the best dish in an afternoon where onli a singl dish fail to impress despit the best effort of our server to misinterpret the phrase pleas cours thing out and do not bring everyth at onc  a surpris larg space featur slick wood and polish surfac throughout it was just after 300pm when we arriv for late lunchear dinner and select wide from the menu inclus of a 15 foie gras appet it was with the hunger deriv from near 8 hour of unpack that we wait onli to have everi singl plate arriv simultan thirti minut later result in both an overload tabl and tough choic about what would tast best at room temperatur or below  focus on the food it should be note that much of what was order actual came to the tabl except well prepar and begin with the foie gras i was immedi impress by the qualiti and present a singl vein the onli flaw in an otherwis robuchonqu prep featur a caramel medallion alongsid a semisweet salad plus creami rich croquett and move next to crispi complex chicken alongsid the equal crisp but decid spici fri it was with good fortun that the milk shake albeit small was present to quell the heat  overlook the spongi dens bao and tepid duck entir lack for crisp skin and instead assist my mother with the light char burger top with woodsi mushroom and aromat marmalad it was perhap with recollect of the zeppol at settebello the day prior that i order the doughnut and although not quit as impress the eggi brioch stood strong beneath a dens lacquer of sugar round out a fair impress afternoon larg warrant the 75 tab if not a signific tipmy parent were in from boston but they both grew up in taiwan so i chose this place over the other one in the plaza base on the overal rate  we end up go to both and this one was not the champion  

i would consid taiwan kitchen to be a dive base on the dirti floor and below averag tabl chair and booth  that not a deal breaker for me sinc ambianc isnt what were here for  we end up split 4 entre 

tofu basil total delici and the best dish we had  they prepar it like three cup chicken but it was even better becaus the tofu was nice and crispi  the sauc was realli good and went perfect with rice  i would come back just for this dish alon  

spici beef noodl soup it was decent but we all agre that the other place was champ  the beef wasnt as tender as it should be  it also wasnt that spici  

pork chop with rice it hard to mess this one up and it was a solid dish that wouldv been a complet lunch or dinner for almost anyon not name toni t  

thick pork noodl soup i didnt mind this but neither my parent nor my wife care for it that much  

they also offer japanes style ramen but sinc when did japanes start put fri chicken in their ramen  i am certain curious  well be back for the tofu basil and give some other plate a shotwild burger is station casino newest gimmick to get peopl in the door of their wildfir properti the billboard and ad blitz work i decid to give them a tri 

basic wildfir rip out the small cafe they use to have and put in wild burger when you walk up the small ramp to the restaur you are met by someon who will say hi and then explain their menu and tell you how to order you place your order and pay on the spot i look over the menu and tell her i want a wild burger she then ask how i want it cook and i say medium well dont laugh there a backstori on whi i like my meat cook medium well unless i know the meat sourc i add an order of onion strip and a drink and hand over my debit card i ask if they swipe player card but she say no that dumb guess they dont care how much money i spend with them then i get hand the receipt to sign it has a place for a tip if you dont have cash to leav and have no clue how the servic is go to be how do you know how much to tip i scribbl down some number grab my drink glass and off i go 

the place is clean not too bright but it got a ton of flat screen and while some of the tvs look great a few have some imag qualiti issu my fountain drink is also kind of flat yep fountain drink hell strike again it better than noth so i grab a seat and wait for my food sinc the food is made to order i temper my expect on time and i get my food fair quick 

what arriv was a pretti stack hamburg that did leav a good visual impress i snap a pictur of it and the onion strip sill in their littl metal fri basket i check out the condiment ive got a1 worcestershir sauc tabasco grey poupon and more right there on the tabl readi to go i got extra napkin alreadi tablesid which will be need and so with that it time to give it a tri 

the hamburg was not bad it was veri messi though you need to use the guy fieri doubl grab hold style to manag it but it was pretti good they cook it right you could tast the meat the tomato were fresh the onion was there everyth was as it should be the onion strip were disappoint theyr too thin and they fall apart when dip into ani sauc not impress with them at all 

overal it wasnt bad would i go out of my way for it no wild burger need to watch and tweak a few thing the concept is good but this place is not quit readi for primetim just yet also hear the staff gripe about the place or talk about their person live in explicit detail isnt too cool either one last thing this place desper need wet wipe or those littl clean cloth packet so you can clean your handin it inaugur season it would be hard to call the phoenix festiv of the art anyth more than a dismal failur  a mere 40 artist plus some band and organ it was underrepres of the valley divers art scene to say the least and yet at the same time it provid me the opportun to do someth i general avoid visit a select of the citi food truck  a collect of approxim ten which were present when the festiv open at 10am repres everyth from lobster to pizza to hot dog barbequ and pie  have alreadi made two breakfast stop prior and with plan for andreoli christma festiv at 200pm i knew id need to save room and as such i perus the option care befor settl on a trioplus one en rout back to the car

start with the most uniqu a food truck concept i certain never saw in the midwest and would have never expect in the desert my first stop of the afternoon was at the main lobster ladi httpwwwmainelobsterladycom a truck describ as a main island girl along with her veri own lobster fishin partner serv the real deal main lobster from the coast of main to the desert southwest and the menu servic and accent all hold true to that definit in everi way

pric substanti higher than the averag food truck given the qualiti of the ingredi my select from the main lobster ladi would be two  the first her signatur main lobster roll with hot butter lobster chunk serv simpli on a grill roll  simpl fresh and load with lobster this was about as simpl as it get and although small consid the 17 price tag it would be hard to quibbl this qualiti of crustacean near 3000 mile from it point of origin as it was everi bit as good as that in boston or elsewher where incident neptun charg a whop 22 for their roll

mov next to a more innov though less impress choic a 9 cone of main shrimp puff arriv as a half dozen hushpuppi size ball of medium size main shrimp ting with butter and herb deep fri to golden and serv alongsid a zippi garlic aioli  tender but a bit too oili for my own person tast and with the shrimp far less snappi than the aforement lobster the aioli was a welcom boost  a shot of flavor compens for an otherwis disappoint dish next time i think id go with the whole belli clam or the lobster mac n cheese

good particular given the fact that it arriv from a truck in the middl of phoenix but pricey at 26 for perhap a dozen bite of food i see the main lobster ladi as a well conceptu idea to fill a void but not someplac id seek out unless i realli had a cravenot over impress  i should have known it would be a zoo on saturday afternoon  everyth they  stock is in larg quantiti so they need lot of custom to turn stuff over  most of their price are pretti good but they have a coupl of high price hidden in there like a bottl of wine that goe for around 650 at walmart price at almost 10  a coupl of thing they do not stock that were on my list medium size noodl and garbanzo bean not in bulk either  the conveyor at the regist are still not work so checkout is more of a hassl than it need to be  i doubt if i will go often as it is not a place that is easi to slip in and get a few thing and get outwinco is great for some peopl not so great for other  here are the pros and con as i see them

pros
low price especi on produce
great selection
bulk area what choices
happi employees

cons
look like a warehouse
often a wait to check out 
no organ produce
c use a credit card cash or debit is fine

 shop there four time and each time im pleasant surpris by the amount of my bill  i like the fact that they have some differ brand i dont see at other local store  howev i do need to supplement my groceri shop down the street at sprout which has the organ and general healthier item i cant find at wincothe whi  helm by chef cullen campbel and high prais by local palat i respect crudo seem to have all the thing id hope for in a local restaur high qualiti sourc a strong sens of communiti and a uniqu but focus menu  in this case raw seafood hand pull mozzarella and housemad pastas

th servic  to say my servic at crudo was perfunctori would be an understat  begin first with kitchen time a 25 minut delay between cours 2 and 3 from pickup to deliveri with my waitress stop by twice to say it would be right out is poor form  addit while speak of my waitress consid the fact that i was obvious interest in the food it would have been nice if she act more interest in me as a diner  instead she did not inquir even onc as to how i enjoy a dish and ask question felt more like attempt to drag forth inform while she instead spent time describ the menu at length to a needi woman who want all her dress on the side and modif to myriad dish  perhap im a bit presumptu here but if someon is there with or without a camera dine solo they are clear there becaus they are passion about the food and if a server choos to ignor that it is evid that he or she cannot read a diner and thus should not be in that posit  particular when the other server were engag their tabl between each cours and even brought the chef out to say hello

crispi pig ear  chili vinaigrett  set the tempo earli this dish is all about flavor and while the textur is larg that of the crackl pork ear and chewi cartilag within the flavor is a bit sweet a bit sour a lot of heat and a lot of porki sapor  cant say i get the price discrep or whi it is so difficult for restaur in general to updat their onlin menu but this is a good choic at 5 or 7

butterfish  tomato lardo arugula  call me crazi but i dont realli get the fuss over this dish sure the smooth textur and mild flavor of the fish are conduc to the overal flavor arc but with the lardo shave particular thin and the ovendri tomato quit intens there simpli was not much here that could not have been achiev with a bit of salt and fresh slice tomato the flavor someth akin to a bland blt and the arugula not particular notabl at all

gril mozzarella  tomato grill date basil  for my money the best savori cours of the night  a strong compliment consid the fact that a lot of the food was quit good  this was simpl and intens each ingredi pack serious flavor and all brought into harmoni by the smoki warm mozzarella  serv with oliv oil brush grill bread ill note here that if you desir more than a singl skimpi slice with this or with ani other cours you should ask well in advanc and if you have my server ask twice as it is like to be forgot

mushroom  mozzarella truffl egg  i love egg but the overcook white and halfset yolk in this dish realli ad noth to the earthi amalgam of mushroom and mozzarella  textur accent by toast brioch and meet with a hefti drizzl of truffl oil i do not believ ani actual truffl was harm in the make of this dish this was without a doubt the most textur interest savori of the even and although i onli receiv anoth slice of bread after the remain juic had turn cool i still wipe this one clean befor send it back to the kitchen

risotto  squid ink chili tuna tomato  appar a bit of a signatur dish at crudo and the onli one my server would offer an opinion on asid from everyth is realli good i must say that although ive had better risotto in term of textur the balanc of flavor here was realli someth els  a subtl sweet from the tomato meld beauti with light heat from the chili and the confit tuna bold flavor stand up admir in the face of the slight gummi rice

porkbelli  smoke tomato agrodolc  fatti and funki with crack skin rest atop toothsom and creami polenta this was pork belli as it should be and show a deft hand with tomato for the fourth of my five prixfix cours the smoke reduct here cut the fat perfect  simpli a great dish and a surpris larg portion

appl frangipan tart  outsourc their dessert to traci dempsey origin i knew the qualiti here would be high and with a bore sound panna cotta vs a pot tiramisu that look quit good as my other option the tart was a clear winner  the crust a dens shortbread and the fill a rich but light almond past with caramel roast appl top off with a bit of whip cream  while i person think ani selfrespect restaur of this calib should be make their dessert in hous it would be hard to quibbl with choos ms dempsey who is now 4 for 4 in my book

good  but im not rush backi am a sucker for thrifti ice cream and thought this would be the end all spot for me sad it is not long gone are the 99 cylind scoop of frozen delight they kept the familiar shape but the price are almost double

norm i get a singl scoop but i was feel adventur and ventur off to a two scoop sunda mediev mad is back so i forgo my normal green tea and pair it with chocol malt crunch add butterscotch and nut and it was meh for 433 when i got rang up i saw that i was charg for a two scoop waffl bowl sunda without get the waffl bowl what is that if there is no button for a sunda without the bowl then i should have been given one the butterscotch was too sweet and not creami the top tast cheap it is better to just get plain ice creami went back for a second time with my friend out of town  i was quit disappoint and i kept talk about to this place to my friend and they were disappoint as well  first the servic wasnt good  at one point we were argu with the server becaus they lead us to believ someth els  and appar if you are on two separ tabl and are togeth if you order 2 piec they just put it on one plate even other sushi restaur dont do that and you pass it over even when you clear state a few time that two peopl want the same fish and so it 2 order 

second the fish shrunk it seem like everyth was cut in half  
the qualiti of fish was still great but i cant compar them to the first time i went there becaus not all the fish were the same  howev i believ the salmon roe and eel qualiti were the same both time  but just the 2nd time around they shrunk  
if you go for your first time it seem like a typic size you would see at other sushi restaur  

everyon was get impati  what happen to their good time that peopl didnt seem to notic the time in between each fish

i dont know if i will be go back  

they have a liquor licens now no more byobfirst time we came here it was phenomen second time not so much of note our favorit item both time be the negitoro hand roll this time we order one omakas 80 and one nigiri tast 48 the main differ between the omakas and nigiri tast are 6 piec of sashimi 3 piec of grill fish and miso soup was it worth the extra 32 certain not the main problem dure this visit was that the serv size were signific smaller than last time rang from 13 to 12 smaller the first time we had 2 nigiri tast becaus that was all they were offer at the time while we werent stuf our hunger was comfort satiat this time around we paid for more food but both left hungri in fact as we left i serious consid stop by ramen sora the qualiti overal is still excel except for the surpris subpar miso soup but they have gotten stingi with their portion size previous while not an inexpens night out the price could be consid reason sad this is no longer the case we are not big eater and when we pay 128 befor taxtip for two tast menus we expect to at least not be still hungri at the end we dont mind shell out top dollar for great food but it is difficult to justifi pay these price for what have becom miniscul portion of food in addit the servic this time was inconsist at best the time between cours was high variabl as was when our glass of water were refil it is heartbreak and we are unlik to returni had huge expect for kabuto base on the onlin review and the recommend of one connect las vega food profession who said his friend like it plus the ramen place monta appar own by the same peopl was such a revel for me kabuto and monta are in the same las vega strip mall for me kabuto was a disappoint it was abov averag sushi with a beer a 10piec nigiri sampler a coupl of extra piec of sushi and a tip my bill came to 84 my tast bud didnt tast sushi that rate that kind of cost
to cut direct to the point two sushi stood out as especi fishi tast the jack mackerel and the shad the jack mackerel had an especi strong sardin tast i was eat the ginger after that one i have to confess im not a veteran of highend sushi place mayb this was how the jack mackerel and the shad was suppos to tast if im spend a lot of money on the food this sushi is flown in fresh daili accord to other onlin review im expect a superb experience
for me the unpleas tast sushi start with the first one it list on the menu as kinm or golden big eye i assum from a googl search it some kind of snapper it was a mild fishi tast not as strong as the jack mackerel or shad but right from the start it was an unpleas fish taste
th sushi i like the most were the fattier tuna plus the sweet shrimp both the medium fatti tuna the chutoro and the premium fatti tuna the otoro were delici the sweet shrimp and the otoro were sushi i bought in addit to the 10piec sampler 
i start my meal with a mango sake that was pleasant and some sort of spici radish i couldnt quit understand how they were pronounc it name 
even the sushi i like didnt blow me away though not enough to justifi the price of a meal at kabuto
th restaur itself is beauti there is no sign on the exterior just a plain wall and a window when you get insid the restaur is truli beauti simpl eleg and tast are the word that come to mind
and the servic was excel they came through there
again i have to acknowledg i dont have experi at top sushi place but i can go to place in the bay area that has sushi that tast as fresh or better on my tast bud and it a quarter of the pricethis place just open a while back in the build left vacant for a while when street of new york left  it is a 24 hour diner with all the normal menu item  i like what they did with the place brighten it up and ad a small counter  i did not go out there but i think they kept the patio dine too

i had a sourdough burger and an insan huge amount of fri  it was pretti good  like all their burger it came with the veggi on the side but the burger was seal shut with the melt chees and grill onion so i ate them as a salad  i was at the counter and servic was pretti good a touch cocki which fit the atmospher  price were reason but like all the countri boy they have coupon they hand out when you pay for bogo that do not have expir date on them35 star for their crepe onli i didnt have the extra calori in me to tri ani of their wonder dessert 

mi sis and i order both a savori and sweet crepe we order the royal crepe grill chicken saute mushroom bacon and cheddar chees and it was just ok to me the crepe itself was some sort of wheat crepe that we werent a fan of we bare got ani piec of mushroom and it was actual too creami for me 

we were on a time crunch so we order the exot crepe to go howev they forgot that we order it to go but just ad a top to cover it for us we tast a littl bit of it befor we head out all of the fruit with the sauc was delici the coconut sorbet was realli good too and had ton of coconut flake unfortun they didnt pack the sorbet separ so by the time we got to the car it was a melt mess 

i also order an ice caramel macchiato and that i like a lot all three item were a littl over 25 befor tax and tip a littl pricey for the experi we had but i still would want to come back and tri their other love dessert i regret not get just some thingalright so here is my two cent on brat haus i suggest to steer clear of the brat i tri beer brat  spici thai  i found them a bit dri and bland  i also found the pretzel less than fabul i do suggest to tri to big juici tasti meatbal much better choic the outsid patio veri cool an open fresh space with plenti of seat and a big ol wall of funki art the servic was also friend and attent and fair price overal it total worth check out if you are in the area and in the mood for someth differfood was 4 star servic was 23

went to lunch on a weekday the bar side was about half full or empti for you pessimist and a friend and i went for a quick lunch

servic was friend but absent long wait between drink refil we ask for a togo box twice and never got it found the box myself so we could get out

it a beauti littl spot with veri good food i just think they need to work out some servic kink in time i am sure they can make the servic as great as the food and locatcustom servic is a fine art this place need a littl attent 

im alway a littl reluct to leav a review that includ negat feedback what busi owner want to read that howev it from honest feedback we can take a close look and make correct when need 

almost none of the huge array of desert were label  a big chocol cover ball could contain anyth while it look pretti i have no idea what i am get pleas label the deserts

if you cannot label the desert have someon at that area of the counter to tell me what they are and help me make a select i had to wait until i got to the regist away from the desert to ask what the item were all with peopl wait in line behind me who want to be the person hold up the show

mi chocol croissant tast faint of meat i am a vegetarian so that made it even more unwelcom some may actual like chocol and turkey 

final when i went up to buy anoth item i wait a long time befor anyon help me i was the onli person wait the counter staff were busi make sandwich no problem there but i was not acknowledg for quit some time id rather get my order taken quick so i may sit and enjoy myself than stand there for 3 or 4 minut while a person make a sandwich 

it interest becaus as i stood there i notic how nice the drop shadow of their logo was paint on the wall they have the detail right in mani way it wild how so much work can go into a place and yet my percept diminish over such small thing as wait an extra 60 second but it does

th egg  chees croissant was mighti fine
mi latt had no froth and was basic milk and espresso not so great

in short please
keep up the great work on the egg  chees croissant excellent
mak it easier to choos a desert 
pay attent to my order simpl mistak it was quick and kind corrected
get a solid latt go 
minim my wait andor make me feel like you care that i am wait dont wipe down the counter and arrang stuff while i stand there unattend to 

best wishthis is a pretti regular dive bar it is locat under firefli on eastern near anthem when we came in weekday afternoon the place was understand near empti there were two other obvious retir peopl in there play video poker and listen to countri music the bartend was veri nice if you put in 20 into the poker machin you get free drink i had no idea and onli put 10 but he still honor it gave us free drink i had my usual jameson and ginger and he did not skimp on the shot there is a jukebox machin sever flat screen tvs video poker at everi seat and atm machin insid for your gambl conveni the restroom was clean and there were no visibl issu with the bar from what i could tell it just definit look and feel like a bar for the much older crowdi wasnt as impress with beach hut as mani of my fellow yelper are 

i walk in at about 1230 pm and grab a menu and sat down brows yelp suggest and hungrili mull over the menu i final decid on the surfin bird sandwich turkey avocado bacon and cream chees the menu say alfalfa sprout are avail on request i request them and was inform that they were out befor i order the ladi in front of me was inform that they were out of chicken and roast beef how can a deli run out of these thing im not sure 

about 20 minut later serious 20 minut to make a cold sandwich that has 4 main ingredi my sandwich was readi i grab it and left becaus i was slight annoy with the general attitud of employe there were three employe and mayb four custom includ myself wait for sandwich the employe look like they were just hang out at work not be veri friend or help and didnt seem to be put too much effort into make my sandwich in less than 20 minut 

when i final bit into the sandwich i was veri unimpress with the qualiti of turkey it tast like water down preslic prepackag turkey from a famili pack of process meat from walmart serious the meat make the sandwich   not the cream chees which i didnt realli enjoy too much either or the various lettucetomatoonion top i dont like slimi deli meat if you do this is your place

i want to love this sandwich particular sinc everyon rave about it and love the uniqu cream chees addit but i didnt love it  i actual didnt like it veri much either 

i probabl wont be back mayb i order the wrong thing mayb they had an off day mayb it doesnt usual take 20 minut to make a sandwich when there are three employe and liter four peopl in the restaur and mayb 10 is a fair price to pay for a small sub not but probabl notmy ex chris decid to take me out on a last minut date night for the hell of it and we were hungri we decid to stop here and eat as it was right next to the galaxi theater where we went to see xmen we look at the option and decid to just order a whole pizza rather than order a few slice which would have cost the same two drink and a whole larg pizza 14 buck cant beat that for a tasti and fill dinner

th pepperoni pizza was veri good i love that they are generous with the chees and top that is one thing i dislik is when a place is stingi with the chees well not here

i think this could becom a regular spot for the spontan dinner and a movi night

they have a lot of italian style option avail and you can order pizza by the slice

i am a fan 3 star aka aok

aok is exact how i feel about this place 

happi hour end earli at 630 ra goe til 7 and they are practic next door  happi hour save arent exact great  1 off an appet  thank for cover the tax i guess

decor is sort of a beachi stoner motif  umcool  there a magazin rack between the stall in the ladi room  umawesom 

food was good though i onli share some appet fri tot  these came with an amus and awesom amount of interest condiment which i enjoy consid my fridg is 23 full of dress and sauc instead of actual food the small burger are ginourm so that probabl whi they dont have such good happi hour food discount they cant be make a ton of money on these

wher this place shine is the servic surpris good beer select and the music  couldv sworn they tap into my itunes

il probabl be back sometim if friend want to go herei am a big fan of their signatur cocktail arizona mule it come in a silver mug if you promis not to steal it ha  the bartend were pleasant and gave good suggest too they realli seem to know the menu  the food was pretti good and way abov averag compar to typic bar fare  i had the gas lamp chicken sandwich and love the grill zucchini that came on it  the fri were gobbl up by my friend  it did howev take forev to get my food and it was not that busi but i think i need to come back again and mayb thing will go a bit smoother  the crowd was pretti eclect but definit er on the younger side  i am sure i will be back againyay it anoth brand new buffet  i stop in for lunch today  here how it was

th good

  this buffet had 77 food item out today  it look as if they might have brought out more after i got my food right at 11 am open time  this is huge for a mediterranean buffet where there are more typic 10 or 15 item     

  the food choic are tasti  somewhat unusu  there was good varieti with 4 soup plenti of meat  cassarol dish pizza   so on  it definit take more than one visit to tri everyth     

  the price is veri low for this type of buffet     

ok so where are the 5 star you ask  glad you ask that

th notasgood

  this build use to hous fuji buffet nee imperi garden  it had a bit of a peculiar vibe to it then  it still doe now  you enter the food serv area from the front door  wherea fuji use all the avail space for serv food mb here has a number of blank spot even though as i said the select is huge for this type of food  the room has an unfinish look to it

  off to the left is a larg room that is their peculiar decor spars furnish cloud hookah bar open from 4 pm to 4 am  you have to go through there to get to the bathrooms

  the men bathroom was run down  had a stink to it     o

  to the right of the serv room is the dine room for the restaur  there are tabl  a few booth  it was decor reason but there was someth uncomfort about it  i couldnt pin the problem down but a good interior decor need to have a look at all three main room of this build  i dont think ani of them are right

now this is onli their fifth day in busi so i hope to stop back in a month or so  see how theyr do  there certain is a place for a mediterranean buffet like this  the excel select of interest food is 4 star right now judg by itself     

weekday lunch buffet onli 799not too sure what to make of this place  one minut it look like a bar the next it feel like someon home with a marbl countertop the kitchen is open so you can see what go on  seem like that a popular way to design restaur these day or is it suppos to be a tavern hmm

i order the bison burger with some sweet potato fri i was hope for a plate full of fri but i got at best 10 piec  if i told you this was a tavern and you got 10 piec of fri would you believ me  yeahright me either guess i need to super size it next time  i order my bison medium but it definit came medium well to well done  i thought it was a bit plain and dri with such an ingredi they should probabl add some bang to give it some pop  

drink here are pretti cheap i thought nathan the bartend is pretti cool guy and was attent  great job  enjoylike everi ben stiller movi i have ever seen this church chicken is predict in everi way not the slightest bit creativ or imagin almost complet untal and almost pain to watch everysingletime

i like this place for these reason which have more to do with the corpor franchise
location
price
product
wifi

i dislik this place for these reason which you might imagin as i have that has more to do with the franchis operator
long wait line in drive thru
al personnel includ manag need better training
on out of three time my order is wrong

i ad extra star becaus i see a genuin desir by everyon at this place to work as hard as they are capablebut there just seem to be some kind of cultur disconnect herelik not a singl person work here has ever eaten church fri chicken a day in their life let alon run a church chicken franchise

on recent exampl good advertis on televis and banner media visibl from the street retail a fish and fri special for 459 1 for cole slaw at the drive thru i had to convinc the cashier what i was tri to orderand the order was still wrong

i the cashier untrain probabl not is she unfriend no but i imagin the manag need to spend more creativ energi to make special moreooh i dont know clear to employees

on anoth occas although my order was correct i had no condiment includ despit ask for them realli ten minut in the drive thru everi timeand no condiment reallywhat are you doing

in summari i like this place and there are rough spot nobodi here has an unsteadi energi flow and everyon seem nice i am almost certain this franchis will get better in time becaus there seem to be a genuin interest by all who ive come into contact with to do what seem natural

practic make perfectso i cam back for the full menu and was well slight underwhelmed

th menu is weird the stea price are per 100gms of meat each steak be 200gms whi not just have the actual bloodi price

2 starter  ok but noth wow 2 main with 3 side dish  veri salti chip and a bottl of ok red was £80

it a lot for what it is

overal  do come for their special offer dont bother with the full menufood truck in vega have some of the yummiest concoct out there i spot the c2c truck park right outsid the lie librari on unlv campus i look at their menu and i was go to order the bronx but they had a special menu and it was advertis the montana sandwich the montana was made up of  chop up ny strip crispi onion i think it had bacon and it was describ to have a special ranch sauc the bread was not that fresh my hoagi was hard on the edg and soggi from humid realli dri the sandwich bare had ani eat it was like smear on the onion were realli nice and crunchi but i did not tast ani sort of ranch it tast like an over power blue chees i am a blue chees fan but this over power the whole sandwich i went for the meal which came with waffl fri and a can of soda for 10 i am not cheap at all but i thought it was a bit pricey for what it was the waffl fri were off the hook though best waffl fri i have ever had i realli see me give c2c anoth tri for their load waffl fri but i was kinda disappoint on the sandwich not go to liethe fountain has becom my regular pre  post cinema stop when i first encount it i was enamour in this outoftown spot with the fountainpark complex of chain and not much els i was inspir to find such a modern freshlypaint gastropub serv realli nice food in such home bar 

ive been here quit regular main when go on a yelp movi night out with other yelper but also for dinner with friend and i have to say that whilst i do still like it a lot it mayb no longer love

th staff are friend but i find the servic a littl patchi i wait for 10 minut at the bar to ask for more water a girl could see me stand with the empti water bottl and i did onc or twice ask her excus me as she was wait for her colleagu to ring someth through the till so she was stand do noth wait to process an order as i did think ask for a fresh bottl of water that i could see in the fridg wouldnt be an inconvenienceand she just ignor me it doe make you feel stupid to polit call out excus me server time across a relat quiet bar to get noth back blank the shame

i was most disappoint though in my most recent meal here i had the scallop as i love scallop in the cauliflour sauc now when i saw this on the menu i thought hmm cauliflour sauc that doesnt sound too tasti but hope it wont be much itll just be on the side and i can ignor it but now a huge plate of the sauc came with three scallop in the middl the scallop were cook realli nice but the sauc was justnot nice it wasnt foul or ined and mayb it just a tast thing but first off i dont think cauliflour is well pair with fish unless it was in a creami sauc the sauc wasnt creami and cauliflour isnt exact the bestlov veget of our nation it go out on a limb to do someth so unusu and unless you know your do it well with lot of great tastetest feedback whi do it i realli didnt enjoy the sauce

i do still like it here and would happili stop in for a drink and mayb some chip itll still probalbi be the precinema spot for a drink but given it outoftown locat it not good enough to make me trek over town to get here there isnt that cheersvib of super friend staff where peopl want to get to know your name at least and the food was patchi and given that there are so mani other nice bar in edinburgh serv great food it mayb need to up it game a littlpost pic but didnt follow up with a reviewoooops

anywho when i check out most pizza place for the first time i almost use their white pizza as a test some peopl love the concept here and they pile everyth but the kitchen sink onto their person creation

for me i like my pie simpl and straightforward less is more imo when i come to pizza no more than three top ani more than that your tastebud will be confused

so i get my white pizza and i gotta say i wasnt a fan of the alfredo sauc on my pizza
linguini alfredo yes white pizza with alfredomehleast i can say ive been here done that but with place like rocco novecento and settebello id rather pay for their white pie which i feel are more enjoy alohathis is a place that has been a mall and termin 4 at sky harbor befor secur and has seem to have free stand locat pop up all over i saw one at 67th just south of union hill and this one across from the mall 

mi mom told me panera bought this place and while i could see some panera item this place was panera on crack mom and i stop in for a quick lunch on my februari trip to arizona we were in between errand for my grandmoth and need a place to gather our bear and have someth to eat we split a sandwich with chicken avocado lettuc tomato and mustard on a dark rye someth panera doesnt have and it was tasti the folk work there were veri help and it gave my mom and i a much need place to plan divid and conquer 

with wildflow bread compani now open across and just up the street i doubt i will be come here but it did exceed my expecti have made it my mission to tri to get to as mani of my bookmark in the area as possibl today i found myself at 808 malasada were sound pretti good for lunch so i decid to give them a tri 

i order the red velvet fill with macadamia nut cream fill i also tri the regular malasada fill with guava this one was a littl on the dri side not as fresh tast as i had hope i definit prefer the red velvet it had a nice textur and i realli enjoy the fill im dont usual like fill donut but this was a treat it was the perfect textur and wasnt too rich i also got a spam musubi to fulfil my savori quotient for lunch honesti the onli reason i order it was becaus they have a 5 minimum credit charg and i just was slight short 

the guy work there were friend and effici i wouldnt go out of my way but theyr worth a triloveeeee me some crepes

w came here for breakfast one morn i order the breakfast burro this come with chipotl crepe egg bacon queso jack avocado and salsa i also ad chorizo to it this crepe was sooooooo delici i do wish that it came with more avocado though the chipotl sauc that it come with was realli good i wash everyth down with a chai tea that wasnt too shabbi 

i realli like this place except there a realli long wait to get your food im not sure if it alway like this but we wait about 3035 minut for our food mayb longer i didnt know what to expect when i came here i thought it was a full on restaur but it not you go to the front get in line and order your dish the place is realli small so seat is also veri limit they should think about expand the place id come back to tri out some more crepe though three and a half star good

  in the past coupl  of month i have experienc the german bread bakeri it is locat in the eastern beltway shop center between port of sub and rubio at the eastern avenu entranc it is away from the mad of the shop center tenant walmart and home depot but close enough for a conveni dessert it is a ten minut walk from walmart and depot and a coupl door away from rubio and biej chines restaur 

   the german bread bakeri is a small shop a flaw is there are no tabl insid there is seat close by outsid rubio in the summer when tripl digit temperatur bake the desert outsid seat is an issu 

  the great custom servic isnt an issu today for exampl the woman who serv my bear paw was veri friend as she talk to me about mount charleston this certain factor into my review if i had a mainfram that german bread compani is 2 12 star worthi id up it to the next level

   whenev i experienc the german bread bakeri i tri a differ item the item i tri were the bear paw berlin with strawberri fill pretzel and cherri danish roll all the pastri that i tri were powderi and tasti napkin were critic the pastri were sticki plus napkin are necessari to use as a tray when sit outsid who know how mani germ peopl and pigeon leav on these tabl as far as the pretzel it look like a cousin of the aunti ann and snack bar hot pretzel look are deceiv this type of pretzel is not prepar hot still my tast bud rate it good concurr to the four experi at the german bread bakeri i sip the german coffe as far as tast it good they serv it in a styrofoam cup drip coffe is the primari coffe beverag that the german bread compani current serves

   in conclus base on my four experi at the german bread bakeri i give it 3 12 star this equat to good and an 85 satisfactori level at this satisfactori level when i am in the immedi area my checkin ought to continulyric  cut crew  just die in your arm tonight
oh i i just ate at searsuck tonight
it must have been someth i read
i just ate at searsuck tonight

i keep order for someth i cant get
artichok heart lie all around me
and i dont see an easi way to get out of this
mi cocktail sit on the bar side table
th curtain are close the place is like an adult cradle
who wouldv thought that a boy like me could come to this

oh i i just ate at searsuck tonight
it must have been someth i read
i just ate at searsuck tonight

oh i i just ate at searsuck tonight
it mustv been some kind of dish
i shouldv walk away i shouldv walk away

searsuck is a hot new restaur in s scottsdal  i went to the origin one in san diego and thought it was okay  the one in scottsdal  well okay at best again  

i think this place was overhyp  grant they won a lot of award vote best new restaur etc  i brought some friend from out of town here think i would treat them to a good meal and experi  needless to say they werent all about it either  we order a bunch of small bite sinc we had a long night ahead of us eat and drink kobe carpaccio scallop bacon egg bacon pork belli meatbal squid sweet heat  the carpaccio was good but noth special  scallop with baconwel everyth tast good with bacon right  my favorit was the egg bacon and pork belli  yummi but belong at breakfast  the squid was sweet and spici and that about it  

the place itself is pretti swanki  the ambienc is hip and romant  overal i think it a great place to hang with friend or bring a date  howev gonna have to pass on the food part  mayb it was an off night  everi dog has it day  i realli want to give this place a chanc so me come back is definit  hope this wont discourag you to go caus i would say tri it on your own and let me know  wink  enjoythis is a place you come for the view and stay for the beer the food is terribl that said my husband work nearbi and has lunch often with cowork while the restaur doe have awesom strip view to peopl watch that not what i meant by view i meant the smoke hot ladi that whi the fella keep comin back even though the food is terrible

i final experienc it for myself befor catch a concert at cosmo we came in for beer and share the mozzarella stick and nacho the guy have tri most everyth and declar these most edibl the nacho are huge theyr decent but i didnt care for the sweet bbq sauc and the qualiti overal was pretti cheap the mozzarella stick were pretti good id get them again light bread thick gooey chees and a decent marinara sauc for dip the real winner here is the beer we all had the man size dirti blond it serv at 29degre and youll get ice crystal your first few sip not all beer is good so cold but this hit the spot

th ladi werent as friend to me as to the guy i was with but they know who their target audienc is they are well train to part men with their money i could do without the sale pitch for golf gear tshirt and whatnot just bring my beer and make it quick unfortun the bartend were pain slow on my visit hope that not the normweekend are when i look forward to brows through my groupon and tri new place 

after a fill meal at 808 sushi it was time for a sweet we decid on sweet addict sinc we were in the area the shop is pretti cute it resembl pretti much ani yogurt shop around town they have a varieti of option cooki and ice cream sandwich cooki sunda or you can choos cooki or ice cream separ my fella and i opt for the cooki sunda sinc we want to maxim our groupon i chose a tuxedo cooki and combin it with the black cherri ice cream my fella chose the macademia nut and white chocol cooki with banana ice cream the best part about this place is the thrifti brand ice cream i grew up on it but im realli not go to drive out of my way for it the cooki were my least favorit part of the dessert but are definit made better by the ice cream

not the most invent concept but the end result is pretti tasti although they could definit work on a better cooki recip  i dont think ill make this spot a regular stop on my dessert rotat but it a good option in the areagoodby waistline

and that sum it up this busi is not for the faint heart the name could not be more spot on sweet addict cooki and ice cream not to be confus with jane addict as my other yelper hh and rm tri to confus me

loc in a regular strip mall next to a few unusu 20 someth store just on south apach and west reno ave it is not hard to miss this place with a pretti easi to read sign out front

shak flavor milk ice cream product are all serv here but the main attract is the cooki sandwich order a custom sandwich to for fill ani sweet tooth at heart

go with the rocki road ice cream with mms cooki on one side and the chocol cooki on the other i truli believ that this would satisfi my inner fatboy unfortun it wasnt to be although a interest concept and half decent ice cream i felt like this busi miss the mark and went a littl overkil the cooki were not as fresh as i thought and the ice cream was run of the mill

although this place is uniqu i feel now ive been there and done that noth realli grab me to say come back other than the day i feel i need to eat my feelings

overal 
cleanli 35
price 
food 34
back again nope that a lie if friend want to come here i cant stop themi hate to be the parti pooper but as someon who is a healthi cook fanat and alway on the search for a lighter choic when im on the go this place doesnt put me off the chart on my wowmet the portion are plenti which is veri nice consid the price the ingredi do seem fresh as well and i veri much like see the open kitchen the staff has alway been friend but when it come to tast textur and health i think there is room for improvement

most of the salad i have tri whether potato pasta or legum base have been grossli overdress the adject that come to mind is gloppi the chana masala chickpea had a pool of oil sit in the middl and the batch was over salt the thai peanut veget were over coat with a viscous dress though the flavor was decent each time i see a beauti creation and order it my lip feel coat chapstick after a few bite the wrap have good flavor but i dont see the point of stuf them with rice carb and carb dont feel healthi to me when coat in a coconut sauc to be fair the chili i had last week was fantast earlier this week howev when it was 60some degre outsid they had no soup seem like an odd special to be miss when the season final turns

i think there is terrif potenti and i hope desert root fare well local food that is fresh made open and honest is what i live to support there is absolut no doubt that this humbl cafe provid better choic than most of the option on mill but i cant sing prais quit yet a few tweak to thin out the sauc adjust the season and mayb some better carbprotein combo and ill be a regularmy friend and i are regular at mcmullan for trivia but we were in the mood to tri someth new we heard about the new trivia at firkin that is on tuesday at 7 and were excit to give it a tri they start a littl earlier than mcmullan which is a plus sinc it a work night 

we arriv around 6pm to get a seat and drink befor trivia start they have happi hour special that go until 7 as well as other beer special that run throughout trivia which is great i onli order an ice tea and i have to say it was terribl it was veri water down and didnt tast veri good at atll ill stick with water or beer next time our server was attent and friend one complaint on the drink was that despit the bar not be over crowd about an hour in they began serv beer in plastic cup instead of glass to everyon i suspect they either dont have enough staff to handl a trivia crowd and turn around on wash dish or they need to invest in more glass 

we enjoy trivia although mcmullan still has my heart they miscalcul our score but when we brought this to their attent they rectifi the situat quick the food was just ok i order a basic blta sandwich and devour it quick as i was starv it was good but realli noth special my fella order the pineappl curri wing and these were the star of the show i realli enjoy the flavor and look forward to return just for these i purchas the groupon that is avail sole to tri these wing again i dont think this place has won us over from mcmullan but it an ok choic if your in the areaterri r had one day left to take care of her groupon for firkin on paradis  so this is where we end up for dinner  i admit i had this bookmark a coupl of month ago and end up drop it off my list due to just the averag review  but when a meal is basic go to be free it realli doesnt hurt to tri 

we came in on a friday night and this place was surpris not busi  consid it fair close to the strip and near the hard rock i expect more peopl  we were seat right away and even though the servic was good our waiter must have been a newbi becaus there was a lot that he didnt know and had to ask for assist  i didnt have an issu with this so i will leav servic with just good  

as for their food all i can realli say is it just a pub with pub type food  noth realli on the menu caught my eye but the price werent bad so im not complain besid the meal was prepaid via terri groupon  still lent i had their seamus crispi fish sandwich and a bowl of clam chowder  the chowder didnt wow me  it tast like your basic campbel soup chowder  as for their fish sandwich it basic one piec of a batter fri fish put insid a bun  i was starv so i end up eat the whole thing it not bad especi for the price  i just dont see myself go out of my way to eat here   

if your come to firkin on paradis keep in mind that this is a pub first restaur second  in other word come here to hang out and get your drink on  by the way i still would consid steiner food over firkin on paradiswell this is a fair new place to the airport all the chain have left the airport pretti much there are still a few
but a lot of them are independ howev hms host has their hand in someif not all not that that is a bad thing
anyway i gave them a tri one morn about 845 i am precis becaus that is what it say on my receipt
th girl take the order is not veri happi and i think that it is veri high priced
y even for the airport
it is veri confus the way you get in line to order your coffe as well you actual have to go through anoth place to get to the order station

 eaten here twice onc with a friend see photo taken on 093012  the first time we order a few item and share and we were both blown away by the veryhigh qualiti and big portion of the dish we tri  my favorit then were the pain perdu with schreiner sausag httpwwwyelpcombizphotosvovomeenaphoenixselectkf5mrjny8rrmu1wkgedbnwkf5mrjny8rrmu1wkgedbnw and the bmoc a huge bonein pork chop present on a love waffl top with two fri egg with caramel appl in whiskey sauc to garnish  httpwwwyelpcombizphotosvovomeenaphoenixselect9blumlsgzobprbvwrvqdtq9blumlsgzobprbvwrvqdtq  we tri two other item the bang pocket didnt impress me and boxti i found it too greasi  on my octob visit i was disappoint in the muchsmal portion pain perdu i receiv httpwwwyelpcombizphotosvovomeenaphoenixselect5jbb8gmjpv1wlkyysatcng5jbb8gmjpv1wlkyysatcng and the piec were so dens they werent much fun to eat httpwwwyelpcombizphotosvovomeenaphoenixselectddmvrbdoa7yz2ogsznjbjgddmvrbdoa7yz2ogsznjbjg  the coffe was still veri good however

f star for the first visit and 1 star for the second great coffe and free refil to boot so what not to love so an averag of 3 star  will return to tri the bmoc again  hope to bump it up to four star which is a good review from me as im assum this isnt a gmofre establishcoupl of things

1 probabl the best breakfast food i have had in a long time albeit über sin it was veri delici i would give five star but

2 they could stand to figur out their seat situat the seat is organ like a carl jrs order food get a number then sit this caus tabl chao becaus peopl come in scope out a spot then a repres from the tabl place the order i call shenanigan becaus my wife and i had to order than wait then liter run to the first avail tabl 

as we finish up the line grew out the door and i felt bad for the poor sucker who were go to give vovomeena their cash then have to stand and wait for a tabl to open up 

we were sure to let the manag know this problem but not sure what in store for their futurwithin a four mile radius of the univers is a plethora of indian restaur india masala is anoth to add to the mix but it tend to fall short compar to the other they serv a lunch buffet from 1130300 for 1099 

price wise it is similar to all the other where it fall flat is in the offer im offer a varieti of dish that are not often seen at other place the veget korma is a primari exampl of this point it was the one i enjoy the most the well season mix of mushroom and potato with the mango chutney gave a balanc tast of sweet and savori the rice in the chicken biryani was also decious it was soft pillowi and flavor i scoop around the dri chicken piec and went with the tandoori instead most of the time it is best to pass on the tandoori becaus it just sit out and lose all the moistur not their instead i found it to be tender and moist other than those three dish i was not impressed

th servic on the other hand was polit and friend the decorum spacious and warm with so much potenti i hope to see them tweak the menu a bit more i woul like to come in for dinner and just order ala cartindia masala is an indian restaur near unlv campus on flamingo  the park lot doe get fill becaus a combin of india masala the various busi around and the small park lot im impress with the interior it is veri nice and a huge improv from what was there onli a few year ago  that be said it is veri nice insid but how doe the rest stack up

wel i came here with my usual larg group of cowork and they were more than accomend  we all did the lunch buffet which was onli 999 the same price as mt everest  in comparison buffet wise i do perfer mt everest a lot more becaus they had more select flavor and better qualiti in the nonsalad and nondessert item but india masala is an ok substitut so they dont have a larg select on their buffet their rice dish wasnt mix well larg patch of nonmix rice was found throughout the curri dish were veri run if they werent meant to be run but their dessert the free mango lassi after checkin and yogurttapiocapud look thing with fruit were all veri delici their meat dish and regulargarl naan were about the same custom servic was excel when a few of us decid to use our free lassi checkin offer and they gave more than enough it becam awesome

ther are better indian restaur in the area the food in the buffet were alright but not good enough for me to be a fan of mayb ill come back for dinner or not do the buffet they do have a happi hour from 3pm6pm for with a drink list and 50 off select appetwoo hoo noth like a mimosa in the las vega airport befor head home

th one at las vega chophous and tavern insid the new mccarran termin are a bit pricey at 12each but you get your own mini bottl of korbel and a generous serv of oj realli it about a mimosa and a half per order 

no food for us sir just a drink and were on our wayit not bad here noth like the 99 ranch mitsuya and other asian market back home in cali but it get the job done i main come here for my alo vera drink shin ramyun noodl and random asian snack dri seawe calpico etc but my viet roommat made bun rieu the other night and was abl to find everyth she need here select is not as good as asiana or lee lee as someon els point out but i think they are tri to get a feel for what the public wants

i lole at all the comment about fishi smell i didnt realiz that that was even a big deal for peopl it aint a good asian market if it doesnt smell like fish is what i say that probabl mean that they dont carrycleanfri fish in hous  bummer mayb the proprietor of asian market fail in arizona becaus the local fear fishi smell haha and it would be nice if someon sole purpos was to give sampl of  yummi asian food and teach custom how to cook but last time i check frys wasnt cook up a thanksgiv meal to those who dont know how to cook a tradit thanksgiv dinner that what the internet is for the except may be costco p

but i digress i support local busi especi ethnic one sinc the peoriaglendal area is serious lack some culturegood food check it out i promis it doesnt smelli kept forget about pep  fodder as soon as i heard it had open by the owner of the bon vivant a favourit bar i put it top of my to tri list but it in such an innocu wee spot and not in an area i normal pass that i kept forgetting

until one late saturday afternoon after a hike around arthur seat and calton hill found me more than hungri and in need of food and coffe and just about to head to broughton street wait no pep let go

i realli like the interior and the friend smile staff the onli reason it current sit at three star is the choic seem to be a littl lack it could be that it was slight later in the day 230pm but they had one type of soup on and mayb 4 sandwich choic and a few of your standard cake now this is still good but the edinburgh café scene is a vari and strong one specialist coffe shop specialist tea shop specialist soup café café with the best caramel shortcak café with fresh juic and smoothi i think for me what pep  fodder was lack was anyth special that help it stand out if i were in the area i would certain go here again but i wouldnt come out of my way

that is the onli reason though  it not conveni the carrot and orang soup was quit nice and a good portion and the pastrami and beetroot panini was realli good and generous fill i realli enjoy my lunch here and the chill out quieter atmospher and ill definit go again to see what els they have to offer it could be that it new and still find it feet i imagin perhap more deli item like chees board and oliv select and 4 type of bread might bring out it strength more

know the bon vivant and how good their food is from their £1 starter bite to their full main i think perhap pep  fodder is just still grow into itself and i hope itll catch upthis place is nice the peopl are nice the meal waswel i feel oblig say nice also 

but here are the misses

1  price to food ratio is terribl for exampl the wagyu slider come in two for 9 buck delici tender but that steep then again ive never realli had bad slider the wing were plump and crispi tast exact like korean fri chicken but again small portion  other item on the menu are your typic vega sushi joint tasti but forgett 90 for 3 peopl later without ani drink and we end up be european full

2 you need high chair  if your go to open in summerlin you expect to serv children  this actual kill my meal hold my child on my lap and eat from tini dish 

in summari the staff is nicemy groupon was about to expir so i final decid to pay this place a visit the best item were the one with bold flavor with ingredi that mask the qualiti of the fish the hamachi shooter and spici tuna on cracker were a perfect exampl of that the fish in both were overpow by the season and sauc but both were enjoy the kalbi rib were rich and sweet but also veri oili the sushi and sashimi were the weakest item due to the chewi and tough textur of some of the fish the sinew in the tuna was rather pronounc and made it tough to eat not sure id come back and chanc are if i am back in this strip mall id hit up settebello or bachi burger insteadcooki on a stick genius dip stick bakeri special in pastri on a stick such as cake pop push pop and cooki on a stick

they open up a few week ago in the smith shop center where sunset meet mountain vista it occupi the space where starbuck use to be

a soon as i walk in the worker were veri friend and smile they explain what they have to offer the cake pop look cute but they seem a littl on the pricey side at 225 each i got a cream chees with oreo and chocol chip cooki on a stick tri say that 3 time and it was delici the price was veri reason at 185 for a larg cookiei like the cooki on a stick idea becaus it not so messy

they can also do charact cooki on a stick for birthday and other special occas they had some on display like spiderman and hello kitty

th bakeri itself is super cute with ampl seat to hang out it would be nice if they offer madetoord coffe drink as well as it would go great with the pastries

i wish dip stick luck with their bakeri it is locat in a semidesert shop center so i hope it bring new life to this areaholi cow when did good old sizzler get so expens  the steak and lobster which use to be an afford 1499 is now 2199  even the senior meal have gone up  and the steak look pretti tini even for 899 see photo  it was a tad chewi but did have real good flavor  the broccoli was excel texa toast was good peach lemonad was pretti sweet  it was includ with the meal but i would rather pay a dollar or two less and just drink water  i dont drink much dure meal  

i dont know whi they make you pay up front when everyth els is like a regular restaur server doubl check your order bring your food to you check back to see if everyth is ok refil your drink etc  my server andrew did an excel job  

i thought it was a good idea to have peopl cut into their steak when it arriv to make sure it is cook the way they like  that probabl save problem later like peopl take advantag by eat part of a steak and then say it isnt done right  mine was perfect cook for medium rare  the broccoli was cook perfect  i could tast salt on everyth though

i notic alot of overweight peopl eat there probabl becaus of the all you can eat salad bar

i felt like i got a better deal moneywis at golden corral base on my last visit there but the sizzler is close and conveni to moteli had lunch with my mom and grandma today becaus it less than a mile from my offic i walk into eat with a 5 star mindset unfortun i didnt get a 5 star experi 

eat is decor beauti it is rustic and urban and modern and east coast meet west coast all at the same time brick wall and simpl art and a few rustic wooden tabl and im in love one star for ambiancedecor 

we sat down and our waiter came by to take our drink order he wasnt veri nice and had this look on his face like i cant wait to walk away from this tabl and i couldnt be less interest in what you want to drink the drink price are a littl ridicul grandma order tea 4 for a cup and 3 for a soda hmmm

also they do not have bottl water i dont understand this my mom tri to order bottl water and the rude waiter just said we dont have that i ask if their water was at least filter and he said well it not tap water but it come from a fountain blankstar what doe that even mean we order a glass anyway and it definit tast like vega tap water mom order coffe instead and believ it or not the coffe tast stale 

i order the dwblt it was delici id give 5 star just for this sandwich if it werent for the shitti servic and awkward unhappi waiter it came with lettuc tomato bacon avocado and chipotl mayo on toast sourdough but it actual tast more like light fri bread the flavor were amaz and the bread was soft but crispi also the bacon was outofthisworld good the sandwich was ooz with fresh and definit one of the best blts ive ever had it came with homemad potato chip which were pretti good too 

mi grandma had the chicken caesar salad she seem to enjoy it mom order the chicken sandwich and she love it she got potato salad with her sandwich i took a bite and it was pretti good  not as good as the dwblt though 


befor we were even finish eat and befor our tabl was clear a waiter who wasnt our walk by and place our check on the tabl i realli hate when this happen i didnt ask for the check yet and it make me feel rush and how do you know i didnt want to order someth els 

im not usual this critic but this restaur has a lot of potenti it alreadi popular and the food is wonder  that the hard part the easi part is good custom servic and eat is sever lack in that depart 

ill give it anoth shot  thoughi had high hope for eat base on all the review i had read of their breakfast but they were sad dash one by one throughout the cours of my meal the hope were most kind of silli look for a live dj want to drink a mimosa but some of them were just basic of eat out have a server who didnt treat me like serv me was the last thing they wish they were do bring mapl syrup with pancak and those were kind of a big deal

i know that sometim i like to order odd thing in the case of eat i order a pancak base meal and a side of grit i ask to switch bacon for sausag i dont know if that consid a big deal in some area but ive never thought it to be a huge thing in the past then my husband order then the waitress said to our tabl guy order are alway so much easier than girl wha i think she was just talk smack about me to my face and to our whole tabl becaus i ask to switch sausag for bacon that alon would have been enough to make me feel uneasi with my meal but the rest of the meal kind of went along the same rout  take a long time for refil of coffe or water not bring ani syrup with pancak and not check in on us for long enough we had to flag someon els down who did bring us the syrup so i could eat my lukewarm meal

anyway the pancak were actual realli realli good the other food was averag but none of it was worth feel like i was a hassl for tri to eat breakfast therei still would go with a subway sub instead 
mayb it was the servic that left me want more but i couldnt even find napkin at this place and the young man that took my order rush me through it i will give it a second tri some other time but for now it was just okaythe beer select won me over  

this place has all the charm of a hospit wait room  it not a place that you want to kick back for a few hour and drink becaus it so bright and uncomfort  asid from that the bartend kept tri to hand me my tab when i wasnt readi to go but dammit i was stay and tri everi beer i want to tri  or so i thought  the beer are strong  at the time i went they have an excel select of ipa one nitro which was so fuck tasti shit dream are made of

i cant rememb be this happi about a beer select sinc i was at papago breweri  hey now there a place you can spend a lot of time at  take note angelsunday brunchlin form eleven am and get longer by the minutereach regist and part of total reward casinopay fortythreetwentythre exact peroth asleep or lateservic quit slowov fifteen minut to request coffe and orang juicea pot of coffe deliv and never refilledstart with snow crab legssplit for easi pickingsenjoy selfserv cold or request heatingcocktail horseradish or hot butter dipspil of leg and mountain of cold peel prawnscrustacean startsushi select quit poor in appear and qualitysimpl salmon and tuna sliver dead abov rice balllook dri and dullbest not to even attempt if it look this poorstandard americanasianhot tray of pad thai egg roll sweet n sour dim sum dumpl etcfil and passingtak a salti smoke salmon deliciouschunk of whole smoke trout tastysliv of prime rib juici salt crust and perfectdri rub rib a stiff chewhash brown or tater tot in individu littl fryer basket for present cute and crunchyindividu caraf of fresh juic from cucumb to grapefruit selfservesom fresh fruit and a crepe to finishjust a crepe made freshbuild your own afterendless choic and decent brunch buffetall i realli rememb about this buffet was stand in line 

stand in line for seat we spent the extra 15 for the express line was it worth it yesdur peak time it probabl save us an hour 

stand in line for the food the way that the buffet is built requir everyon to stand in line to get to ani of the popular food station it was a nightmar but probabl also a strategi by the design to get everi one fill up on the cheap food becaus guess what is at the end of the line the most expens foodcrab leg clam oyster and shrimp by the time we actual got back to our seat with the food most of it was cold eek but the best way to get through the line is to pair up and have one person hold a place in the line while the other person put the plate full of food on the tabl repeat 

the food prime rib and lamb chop were dri clam chowder was super salti sweet potato tater tot were delish kobe slider were ok crab leg were ok shrimp was huge and fresh and everyth els wasnt too memor 

butsinc i paid 65 for this buffet i was go to get the most bang for my buck the oyster my friend and i origin grab a bunch of oyster in the shell but then realiz we would get the most out of the oyster shot which are at the veri end of the buffet line we didnt even have to wait in line we just kept grab the oyster shot from the counter we pour the extra tomato juic out and just kept eat needless to saya delici overdos of raw oyster p

for dessert i realli like the macaron the creme brule the watermelon mint sorbet so refresh clean and the fig gelato were delish also they serv fresh squeez orang juic and watermelon juic here just ask the waiter love 

overal there are some high point but i consid this place averag when there are compet buffet in the vicin with less line lower price and more uniqu dishjust got back from a love time in vega and i feel i realli have to review this buffet  no realli  my bitter compel me even sever day after the fact

a friend of mine who had tri this buffet on a previous trip just rave and rave about it and was eager to have the rest of our group tri it all the while hype it up to be the mother of all buffet and so good youll pass out  yeahhhh not so much  i felt bad for disappoint him but after spend 50 for a singl meal i have a right to be a tad critic  so here how it stack up

pros

amaz food  the ingredi seem fresh and well assembl and everi dish i tri was incred flavor  gourmet inde  and the onli reason this buffet get three star from me instead of one or two
vari select of dishescultur representations
gorg atmospher  i love the clean line of polish glass and stainless steel at everi turn  and i appreci the fact that each separ area has it own individu look and feel
street taco station  someon somewher heard my prayer on this  i was so excit to tri my carnita taco that i almost ran into some poor unsuspect ladi in my frenzi to get back to my tabl  howev by the time i was abl to make it out of the crazi line for food they were ice cold and the carnita were hard    more on that below

cons

pric  this mutha is expens  i mean serious what is that about  i chose to tri this the one time for the experi but for what this buffet offer it hard seem worth it  i could go to the wynn buffet or to a lesser degre wick spoon to get more for my money if the goal was as it usual is stuf my face with yummi food  
servic lag  onc my friend was abl to flag down one of the server to order our drink he was pretti good about see to our need  initi though he was nowher to be found  we had just come from the valley of fire about 40 minut outsid of vega and were die of thirst but no one came to ask for our order for a good 1015 minut after be seat  plenti of server pass us and our conspicu empti tabl that even but no one bother to stop
lin  crazi unforgiv tortur long line  as a few previous review have note this place has an absolut aw set up  i can see that if they just move a few of the station around the dine area perhap on the other side of the dessert bar for instanc it would help immens with the pileup of angryhungri patron  as it was i wait a good hour on my feet plate in hand just for a chanc to see what food were offer  and this is after wait almost an hour and a half just to get in  the line hard ever move becaus the ladi work the carv station move at a glacial pace and honest look like she could cri from be overwhelm with order  i wouldv avoid the meat altogeth realli but after wait that long to get a shot at my differ option i knew i had to at least tri some rib and the brisket  there would be no go back that for sure  i hard ever got a chanc to eat with my friend becaus we all stood in the massiv line of doom at vari time    boo
rud staff  the situat in line was intens folk as i have mention but there was intens from the kitchen too  when i had final made my way up to the carv station hallelujah an older gentleman came right up in front of me and lift his plate up ask if the carv ladi could put just the tiniest piec of chicken on it  while i was in no mood to allow someon to cut in front of me even i felt this sweet old man deserv a better respons than what he receiv  one of the kitchen staff heard him and came forward rude yell at him to get to the back of the line  he scowl in the general direct of the rest of us too  i get that he may have been have a rough night with a bunch of unhappi patron but there was no need for that  im a big girl and i can speak for myself thanks
rep out of food  i miss out on mac and chees and green tea mochi ball peopl  and onc they ran out there was no replac them
they limit your portion  think about this  it a buffet for cri out loud  for 50 i think i am entitl to pile my plate if i choos but manag came around and liter limit the quantiti of meat per person  not cool  not cool at alli chose to go here sole base on the way the food was describ on the hotel pamphlet and yelp review it probabl would have been a worthi meal  if it had just been the cost of the unlimit wristband 25 plus 15 but this was sole for breakfast alon dinner price were the unlimit wristband 25 and an addit 25 flip what that right we paid 50person to eat here i was contempl go somewher els but after an almost hour wait and reserv at insert coin i alreadi had to push back onc i said forget it now if your not go to eat seafood or high end meat save your money and go somewher else
i ate 35 plate of crab leg cevich shooter shrimp cocktail mussel and oyster the other half a plate was pick from here and there the one random pick that that i end up realli love was spici fish the fish tast like it had been marin in a in season that had a quick but low kick of heat and a splash of salt at the end i was sad i didnt find it until my last plate but someth tell me it wasnt the best thing for you 
i was so full i didnt realli get to tri much of the dessert i had a creme brule which was fabul it was caramel to perfect on top while be thick and rich in the center i also grab a coupl of cooki for the road which were nice to snack on late in the even after drink i would save this buffet for special occas i dont know if would ever come back to eat just for the heck of it  the wait alon had me tick off and starvso upon confer with the wifey it appear as though i got my figur turn around as to the cost of the buffet the buffet if you do not have a 24 hour wrist band is 50person if you have the 24 hour wristband which run a penni shi of 50person the bacchan buffet is an addit 25 for dinner so we technic paid 75person to eat here but part of those fund paid for our breakfast the other two morn still not worth it in my humbl opiniondefinit not worth the price 55 or the wait time

i thought for sure it would exceed wick spoon but it just didnt  they do offer  more food but you definit feel like you are in a mess hall  everyon just wait to get some grub  it was a bit ridicul wait to get seat which can easili take over 1 hour and then onc you are insid you are wait in a long assembl line to get some food on your plate

noth stood out here at all other than the jasmin chicken soup which stay pipe hot  unfortun that was the onli highlight for me  dont get me wrong everyth was good and there was plenti of varieti but i didnt feel like the price was justifi  i probabl wouldnt choos to come here againthe number one buffet in the las vega by usa today if your a tourist im sure you saw that and decid to yelp it to see if it was ani good great job

th bacchan buffet has steadi declin for me most due to the behemoth price  50 which could be justifi for it mammoth size choic when it first open it was around 30 for dinner which made it imposs to pass in term of buffet in las vega then they increas the price gradual bait and switch 

should you go here 

ye if
1 the line isnt atroci long a hour plus
  you could pay 15 per person to get in the fast pass line 
2 if there is not a major convent ie edc ces sema etc
  this would make the line 2 hour long
3 money aint a thang
4 comped
5 relat from out of town that want to experi a vega buffet 

is it good

usu i wont tell you what to eat becaus half the thing arent the same the carv station has been solid and the assort of ice cream flavor are pretti cool i like the brown ale caramel and the thai tea flavor you can get souffl bake to order just ask you might even see dyan ng the dessert boss whose pretti cute 2 hr wait and 4th of juli buffet is 60  

ive never wait this long or paid that much for a buffet in my life i think peopl hype up this buffet way too much becaus it definit not so much more impress than wynn or bellagio although to be fair it was 4th of juli dinner and i desper want to tri bacchan sinc i first heard about it it has been on my vega bucket list for awhil now 

at first i wait in line with 5 other in our group but sinc i found out i was abl to use my disabl pass to bypass the 2 hr line and wait in the express line  i opt for that option sinc i could onli bring anoth person in with me the rest of the group left to eat somewher els and as determin as i was i stood wait with my bf in the express line

aft about an hour of  wait i was get extrem impati becaus they continu allow diamond platinum buffet of buffet peopl in and complet ignor everyon in the express line some peopl actual paid an addit 20 to wait in the express line and yet they could not get in so they start complain after awhil they final start let some of us in the express line in but the wait was not over after we paid for the buffet we had to wait in yet anoth line to get seat then after get seat we had to wait in line to get food the whole ordeal was a wast of time and energi and by the time we sat down to eat we werent even that hungri anymor 

the food option are definit plenti with oyster crab leg lobster roll etc in the seafood section sausag prime rib filet lamb chop etc in the carv station and a varieti of  differ ethnic food in the back the most impress station in the buffet would have to be the dessert i absolut love the mochi ice cream and gelato the qualiti of all the food is pretti decent but i would never wait in such a long time or pay that price for buffet again if you want to tri bacchan the best time is probabl brunch or late lunch to avoid line and you pay a discount price avoid go dure holiday they mark up the price and there realli noth special on the menu to justifi that price changmeh i was disappoint after hear about how great this place was we got here around noon and there was a veri short line but right after we got in line the line veri quick got extrem long so i guess we got lucki 41 per person for lunch on a sunday for us

a larg varieti of differ type of food but each type had veri basic you get your asian section with your typic stuff you would see at panda express and some special item like the pork bun and stuff noth amaz though

mexican section was good they have a taco guy that make u warm taco some bean some salsa some rice and they have a small ice chest with special mexican drink so that was pretti cool

meat select was pretti good and the meat server guy was realli nice the prime rib was top notch definit the best item at the buffet for sure it was veri soft and tender melt in my mouth done right 

seafood section was most cold stuff i didnt realli get much from there at all

then there were some chicken and waffl egg breakfast item pizza and omlett 

dessert section look nice most cake pie ice cream crepe but noth was amaz to me my favorit was probabl the oreo moos cake which was pretti good

glad i gave this place a shot after hear all about it but i would probabl tri anoth buffet next time dont get me wrong this is definit one of the better buffet but just not as amaz as everyon make it soundgood place but expensive

r for a buffeti probabl shouldnt go to a buffet and call the dim sum and the dessert my fav  becaus that would be a wast of my 50 per person  thank to traci l for her review that got me think that i realli need to eat here

bacchan you elus trendi buffet  the first time i tri to eat here for brunch they told me to come back in three hour  whhattt  well now that i have eaten here i can say i went and ate and prob wont eat here again  pluse for their ticket system that cut down on the frustrat stand in line experience

th seafood was averag  yes there were crab leg and yes you can get them steam in the asian section  there were also oyster not so good mussel cevich shrimp and shellfish in various sauc  the seafood didnt rock my world
their were some smaller individu size food like wagyu beef burger and sea bass  the sea bass with bok choy was actual one of my fav stand out dish  total unexpect but the dim sum in the asian section was perfect steam and delici and they wrapper of their hargow didnt stick or break when you tri to eat it  other thing i like individu wedg salad heirloom tomato salad steam crab leg rack of lamb and mash sweet potato  

i skip the mexican area most of the italian and the major of the carv station other then the lamb i know i know but i hate not have room for dessert i also wasnt in an eat until you feel sick mood lol  i will say that the dessert was as amaz as everyon said      

mi fav 1 mango chili lime gelato wow what a refresh combin of flavor after all the mini mealtyp dish i had  2 macaroon enough said  3 green tea redbean cooki  i actual got these think it was pistachio but i was like oohhh is this red bean  win  i mean there were so mani dessert that youd get a stomach ach tri them all  they also had crepe and shave ice  

i didnt see all the good stuff other ate such as fri chicken and waffl sweet potato tot or madetoord souffl   mayb next time  the servic was pretti good and they refil my ginger ale enough time howev the seat area was kind of dirti on the floor but i understand with the foot traffic in the place it must be hard to clean everi littl food item that fall   oh yeah i must mention the young skinni asian coupl sit next to me who serious kill 45 plate of just food and 2 of dessert they didnt even pick around their plate  they ate like champ i was like whooooaaaaaa  

 i am veri happi that i got to tri this place but my verdict way better than wick spoon but doesnt come close to beat the wynnnot worth the 5399 on a sat night i mean if there gonna be a price hike on the weekend then at least complement it with higher qualiti food i realli didnt see anyth that would have justifi the price there was no lobster rib eye foie gras or brontosaurus it was said they had king crab but what they actual had was a blend of snow crab and small king crab leg that were the same size as the snow crab they did have some miso glaze seabass which save them from a 2 star rate 

the best part of the buffet was their dessert bar they had frozen mochi macaron cake pop chocol dip strawberri gelato and great top for ice cream present of all these were veri exquisite

although the dessert was awesom it isnt what i would pay 54 for you would think for the 2hr wait and anoth hr to get seat it would be life chang but it far from you still see the chines food corn on the cob pizza taco and other ordinari offer youd see at hometown buffet if you want to experi this place id suggest come on a nonfri or sat night3rd time visit

go downhil  but the price is still the same or increased

th price is still the same

th wait has chang you now have to precheck in at the kiosk then itll print out a littl receipt where it tell you what time to go back to the podium to check in and then wait in line to pay 

we got there at 445 expect a long wait but instead we had to do the kiosk thing and end up eat at 7pm instead and we were in a time crunch sinc we had a show at 930pm if we had known this earli we wouldnt have been so rush anyway so im give you a head up now

on to the food same select but less look like they cut down on the dessert back in januari i rememb be abl to select from 4 to 5 differ mochi flavor this time just two there were more ice cream  sorbet back in januari now there were onli less than one row of ice cream select the other row was display only

th crab leg were alright still not as meati howev it is better than the first time ive visit the stone crab claw were not good  no tast if im pay over 50 for buffet i expect better qualiti seafood those crab leg need to be upgrad to fatter one those skinni leg are not accept i can get those crab leg at a differ buffet for a much lesser price

their turn around time for plate were slow this time there were time when there were no plate at all in almost all of the station 

i must say that this 3rd visit was a let down most of the time i was just walk around think what i should get to eat noth realli stood out this time except for their miso glaze sea bass

im not sure if ill be visit bacchan again if they continu with this qualiti of food it just wasnt as good as when they first start if that the case i rather spend less money at a differ buffet and eat mediocr food whi pay so much and also get slight abov mediocr foodi came here with a friend a few week ago i saw pictur of those jumbo margarita and just haddd to tri it out lol 

they have a cute littl outdoor patio with a fire pit so we sat outsid sinc it was beauti weather at the time so we start off with the guacamol i loveee guacamol so i alway have to get it when i hit up a new restaur it was ehhh for the entre we order the crispi taco combo it come with rice and bean and we just share it i think it was a fair good amount i enjoy it 


last but not least the drink love the margarita your talk about mayb 10 a glass i mean that is the usual price but imagin jumbo one love it 

i thought the food was mediocr noth great howev id probabl come back to tri their happi hour or just to get the jumbo margarita lol this place doe a fine job at cook chicken tender and fri they even got the texa toast down to a perfection

cam in here while troll around temp and decid to give them a shout out locat veri close to asu and should be a popular spot when you need to catch some bird

ord the biggest thing on the menu call the caniac combo stop drink the dread soda pop and went with some dihydrogen monoxid it is a lot better for you and the price of the combo goe down quit a bit

th menu here is veri simpl and they give you a basic no thrill meal you can alway substitut some of the side if you so desir the big thing everyon cri about is the top secret sauc mayb i miss the boat on this one but it is noth more than some doctor up mayonnaise

food is pretti good and the chicken is veri tender good chanc they are do that southern trick of marin it in some season butter milk overnight that alway keep it juici and flavor after frying

would like to see some more dip sauc just take some regular frank hot sauc and add equal part of brown sugar and simmer it in a pan some countri fri chicken gravi would be good also mayb just offer some jalapeno or someth spici to add a littl kick

defin get realli busi around lunch time saw ton of sweati blue collar worker like me come in and chow down on big plate of chicken some of them look like they could have skip the soda pop as well

recommend bring your own dip sauc or hot sauc to complet the occas some peopl just need more option cluck cluck aok

325 stardecent taco but the not at that price  if im drop 14 on 3 small taco it better have the ambianc of the mission or the creativ and flair of barrio queen  there are too mani good taco in this town for a fraction the cost and 4 for that chip and salsa  that a meal misdemeanori had to give this place a second chance

i still have issu with this place but this time my visit here was met with much warmer and friendlier servic  the servic was enough to make this place worth visiting

her the deal  it is a fast food panda express like filipino food restaur  a 3 item combo was onli 599 or you could buy just a serv of someth  i onli know 2 dish in filipino food pancit and adobo  for some reason i didnt get ani of that i didnt see ani in the steam tray  

i ask the ladi to just put 2 of the best dish with some rice  i had chicken curri and someth els  the chicken curri was decent the other dish was like littl bean like lentil  it was ok  they did have some fish dish  

with the friendli and the fact that it is super cheap i would say it is worth 3 star the food was not impress it was okayas a huge fan of the mapl tree cafe i was realli excit to help out a local busi by tri out their new locat at lucki 
i wish that i didnt and i wont go back 
 

complaint hand down  the service

1  we were greet at the door by a waitress who didnt even know the proper name of the restaur 
2  the waitress did not refil our drink even though the drink were empti about 15 minut befor our meal came yes it was a long wait which we were ok with we know it is a new locat howev not have drink while eat is just not ok in fact she never check back until we were finish eat and we were there for quit a while
3  i order mapl coffe and the waitress final ask if i want a refil i said just coffe pleas 2 are just too mani despit be amaz she brought anoth mapl coffe no water no drink for my guest in fact the waitress was not happi about ask for anoth drink realli she obvious onli want a larger tip i tip 20 standard but i tip better for good servic 



4  we were charg for a lunch item with our breakfast that we did not order we did not receiv it in fact that item was not even on the menu that we had when we told the waitress she basic said  oh i will have to check on that  not sorri or yeh you definit didnt order that she took our order how could she not know what we order 

if you dont care about the custom then it is veri appar to the custom and they wont return i realiz that i am just one custom but   

and now the good 
1  the food is delici the menu is veri close if not the same as the main locat 
2  i still wont return but the atmospher is nice and there are tvs for a relax view of a sport event 

0 star for servic 
3 star for the cook staff  behind the scene staff who  were work veri hard to creat good foodstop into this nice place for lunch today  it offer indoor  out front patio dine here in the lunch villag around 7th av  mcdowel  for this first visit i went with their main featur sandwich call a wreck on multigrain wheat bread  it come with salami roast beef turkey ham  swiss chees  i had them garnish it with mustard hot pepper lettuc tomato onion  pickl  i also order a chocol malt

  given all those ingredi this sandwich sound like a feast but it wasnt  although tasti it was rather small

  the chocol malt was thick delici  big enough for the money 16oz  it 5 star for the malt but 3 overal as you wont get a pot belli on these littl sandwich     

a wreck sandwich 5 chocol malt 290like other in the area we wait and watch as this space develop into central bistro  the atmospher is delight albeit loud  with the window open gotta love phoenix this time of year it was glorious  i do wonder what the sound level will be like onc the window are closed

food is delici  servic good  one big problem  on 2 visit we observ bartend prep garnish with bare hand  i mean peel an orang with juic run down his hand and arm then slice it up to use in drink  last visit we observ a bartend put his hand down into the oliv jar grab a hand and put them in the garnish tray  i immedi took the oliv out of my martini

pleas  to the wonder peopl at central bistro  get it togeth befor maricopa counti come to visitbourbon is a nice place and i am go to comment onli on the latenight atmospher bar onli becaus i havent gone here dure the day

not i have alreadi left a review and becaus it was slight negat did bourbon delet it

with that said bourbon is a pretti nice chandler countri bar there arent mani countri bar around but this one is right in downtown chandler yeehaw

i felt that the place was too small for it britch in all honesti when i go out for the night wherev it be the number one prioriti is to drink to do this you need either peopl come to give you drink or to be abl to get to the bar this place fail on both of those front there was mayb one server on the floor and the bar was packed

no offens to the older crowd but the older crowd that is there up til 11pm stick to the bar like flys on cowpi they have all their chair line up and cozi up to the bar and it is imposs to get to the bar to holler at the bartend most seem to be sit there babysit their drink for an hour even if you manag to tap someon on the shoulder which you shouldnt have to the chair are heavi bulki and there are so mani peopl pack in there that you cant move it over to access the bar

now i may be 30yr old but i still like to occasion go out and get hammer drunk becaus the bar is pretti much offlimit i pretti much find myself drink one beer for 3 hour becaus i know it an absolut bitch to get to the bar my suggest to burbon if your listen is to ditch half those damn chair when you stop serv if peopl want to stand by the bar then they can do that  id just much rather wiggl my way in between stand peopl than tri to catapult myself over the greatwallofbourbonjackchairs

th atmospher is pretti cool i mean it countri and i love countri it is a littl loud in there though  and this is come from someon who search out where it is the loudest in a club becaus i like to feel my music i guess i would rather my countri music to be a littl quieter i shouldnt have to holler at the top of my lung to talk to someon across from me at the back of the bar

also where are the drink specialso 5 guy just open this locat a few week back and i figur i would check it out  ive eaten here twice now sheer out of the fact that it in the same shop complex as my office

in the two time that ive been here ive gone with the same thingsmal cheeseburg with some top on it  the burger are better then i rememb when i first tri 5 guy a few year ago which is better then the first time i went back when i live in mesa  i didnt have a good experi dine there and havent been back sinc until now

i will say the burger are better then i rememb  but overal im just not impress with them as a whole here why

for starter i find them to be ridicul overpr  i got a small pop and a cheeseburg and it was 742  no that not horribl but all my cowork and i agre that they are expens  if i had gone with a full meal mean gotten the fri it would have cost me well over 1012 dollar  that for a small cheeseburg  no combo meal here everyth is a la carte

second the wait both time has been tremend the first time i wait almost 15 minut for my order today the wait was about the same  there were 10 order ahead of us and we were all in a rush to get our food  i know it sound crazi but they seem to have a big grill with lot of peopl work behind the counter and they seem to make the burger as their order but in batch  i cant understand how they can get that behind i mean there a guy stand there make like 10 burger at time and like 3 or 4 guy on the grill  whi the wait then

third everyth come in a brown bag even if your dine in  i dont get it whi cant i get a plate or someth especi if i had gotten fri it just seem like a weird way to eat and serv food

last the seat here is okay but when we were there dure a rush there was a limit about of tabl  there were 4 of us and we were unabl to dine in so we got our food to go  they have a mixtur of high bar stool type tabl that seat 3 and some 4 top for seat as well   if the place was busi like it was today at lunch there realli wasnt a place to sit for all 4 of us  not a huge problem but it did damper our experi there as we were all hope to dine in and sit together

on the upsid they do have peanut galor for you to snack on while your wait and one of those realli cool pop machin that has a million differ flavor to choos from

overal it just okay im not unimpress but im not over the moon about this place eitherseñor sushi was an interest experi the atmospher is kind of funni it look like it was a night club befor the window are still black out and there is a giant wooden danc floor and huge bar it was a littl weird it did not feel like a sushi place 
anyway i had a groupon so we decid to check it out for lunch 
we seat ourselv and the babi fyi they have good high chair where my babi cant crawl out 
the menu had some fun thing like edamam with tapatio we decid to tri 3 roll tres queso milana and guacamuchalito we also got fri rice for babi to chew on 
the roll were pretti expens 11 dollar per about 
wow these roll were huge we order waaaay too mani we can usual split 3 roll between us but not here we had so much left over i would prefer them smaller and cheaper so i can keep up a varieti i love to get mani differ kind of roll and not just 1 or 2 fortun we had a groupon so the price was not too bad 
the roll were veri tasti i was a fan of the queso one and hubbi like the guaca one the problem was we onli got friend cheesi roll so it was a veri heavi meal i didnt leav the sushi place feel like i got pretti healthi food like i usual did i went home and took a nap and was still stuf 

i did not find ani problem with the servic it was fine for me 

now the question will we be back hubbi say he probabl wont becaus he like tradit healthi food i would go back with a friend and anoth groupon but would order a lot differoh where to start

let start with the food  order the jalapeno appet mexican roll mohica momila roll and chicken tender with fri for the kiddo in our dinner party

th jalapeño app was muy delicioso and not at all what i was expect  they were jalapeño slice in half lengthwis light and crispili bread and stuf with crab among other thing  the jalapeno were super fresh  they appear to be uncook despit be bread which gave them a surpris good crunch

th mexican roll was my favorit roll  it look like your tradit sushi roll but with a latin interpret  it came with a dip sauc that was difficult to figur out exact what was in it but i found myself soak my roll in it  and their special spici sauc is outstand  

the kitchen was about as slow as they come  after mayb 30 minut the chicken tender came out  it took anoth 25 minut or so befor the jalapeño app came out and mayb 15 more minut befor the mexican roll arriv  and then mayb anoth 15 minut befor the molica mimolca roll was deliv  i am glad the children dish came out first but i would think both dinner dish would have been serv at the same time  and serious it was a long wait time for food preparation

th servic was pretti friend but it took at least ten minut befor our server initi stop by our tabl  grant it was a super busi night but there were a hand of time when i look for a server but was left sit there for five or ten minut tri to catch her attent to ask for this or that  

the ambianc and set like other review state  this place look like more of a danc club with the light on so mayb tri to dim the light wouldnt be a bad idea  and the dark tint on the front glass is just tacki  mayb this is one of those place that turn into a club afterhour so if that the case then mayb they could just pull off the tint by the front door so you it seem more invit and open from the outsid  not sure whi the tint bother me so much but it does

next time id probabl order carryoutlocat right next to the movi theater which is good  bad when the movi theater is crowd this tini place which is smaller than ani cold stone ive ever been too is spill over with peopl wait in line  the ice cream is as good as it is at ani cold stone       weekday lunch buffet       

stop in here today to tri the buffet join by arlin b norm r  mike c  this place is realli nice insid especi the bathroom  no really

i start off with appet  it was a stuf orang thing  sorri i dont know what was on the outsid or insid of it but it was good  then it was on to the two soup one of which was veri spici  whoop i fail to write down the name of them too

larg plate were provid  to me that speak of help yourself to all the food you like  i appreci them  

the chicken curri  tandoori chicken were good  especi the pulav fanci rice  there was also chow citolo kootu a tasti lentil dish aloo mutter potato etc  more  about 15 food item in all  after a bit we were each treat to a dosa by our server lady

th food tend toward the spici here so i wouldnt recommend it for most kid  there were also some negat for me

  the naan bread was plain  sit out cold in a serv tray rather than be brought pipe hot to the tabl  there was no option of garlic flavor my favorite

  the soup  other bowl friend dish had to go into littl stainless steel cup  yes ive seen them at some other indian buffet but i dont like them  i like medium size china bowl becaus they are emot warmer and not so warm hot for your finger tri to carri them to the table

  there were no treat to speak of beyond the dosa and a dessert that look like cream of wheat  wasnt  it tast ok but there was no mango juic no indian tea and no gulab jamun monkey ball     

  numer empti tray occupi serv area  perhap they are use for the 1299 buffet on weekend but they yell stingi to the weekday diner the opposit of what the big plate were tri to say

soooo all in all it 3 star from here for this one  while it not bad realli i think india palac just a block away is a better choic     

weekday lunch buffet  999much like with ani expans sometim thing get lost in the process the origin locat in phoenix had realli great carn asada this locat in scottsdal is ador and the servic is good but the food has taken a bit of a hit dont get me wrong it still a decent lunch choic but your sock are not at risk of get knock off

park is a nightmar so be prepar for that and overal it not a bad spot they have a huge backyard that is realli cozi and nice but the qualiti of the food is kind of dissapoint perhap if i never had gallo blanco or taco atoyac i wouldnt know ani better but i have and i dothis review is more about the servic than the food i had the food here onc befor and it was fantast so when my friend came in from denver i said yes let meet here the food is great
wel the food was great awesom for me i got the brussel sprout saladwhich has a touch of bacon 1400 veri good but veri high price even for the airport
mi friend got a burger that came with fri for 1300 that was a bit high i thought
th bun complet fell apart  we dont know whi howev the food is veri good so that is not the issue
th issu was our server
sh was the absolut worst
 everyon els is happi in here take good care of their custom and realli work hard we had to get the one that did not want to be there that did not have ani idea what was go on in the restaur at all
our server was imelda she may of been have a realli bad day or just complet uncar about her job
 we wait about 20 min for our food which of cours this is a sit down place so i am not complain about that at all
howev in over an hour in the place we were never offer a refil on our tea i had hot  she had ice our food was brought out to us she never ask  do you need anyth els how is everyth someth more a refil dessertnoth when she did a drive by to throw the check on the tabl i was abl to ask for a take away contain for my friend which she did bring to us
but realli it was a horribl experi with imelda
i would watch her walk around not realli do anyth just stroke her hair
i wonder whi she did not check on us it was 230 in the afternoon she was not even busy

th place is decor veri nice with a nice faux fireplac which i think is realli nice and relaxing
i realli want to have a nice time here i told my friend from denver that she was go to love the food here
mayb we will tri it again but i will be sure to get a differ server
th hostess were sweet and friendthere are four thai restaur within a block of each other and my mom thai kitchen is the newest addit it is a clean and modern space with minim decor and quiet background music

when i arriv earli even midweek i was the onli custom the server possibl ownermanag was friend and chatti i order the tom yum gai which is a spici broth with lemongrass lime mushroom tomato cilantro and chicken i ask for it nativ thai spici and it was perfect the server brought me some nam phrik fish sauc with chili in case it wasnt spici enough but it was

for the entre i ask for her recommend say i was look for someth with noodl she got veri excit about a dish that unfortun i didnt catch the name of and i went with her suggestion

unfortun it wasnt great it was a big bowl of beef broth and noodl similar in appear to vietnames pho but the resembl stop with the look it was overpow with lemongrass liter everi spoon was a spoon of lemongrass the noodl were ramen in style and complet overcook to the point of be gummi i made a valiant effort to eat around the lemongrass and noodl but gave up it was ined when she came by to check i told her there was too much lemongrass for my tast and that i didnt realli like it but she said that is how it is suppos to be no suggest of a replac was made and after that she kind of avoid my tabl i was consid dessert i have a weak for sticki rice and mango but i wasnt given the option as the check was automat dropped

on other thing that kind of bug me  while i was there anoth tabl was seat and they ask for the happi hour menu i wasnt offer the happi hour menu and i would have like to at least been given the opportun to take a look at it noth on my bill was discount for happi hour

36 inc tax and tip for small soup bowl of noodl and 2 beernot sure when rocco replac eddi at this locat but im still surpris either would consid this locat ideal  yes it in a busi corridor on rainbow but it not the easiest shop center to navigate

a expect onli chang to the restaur is basic the name  it still a mompop italian restaur focus on pizza  i went with the two slice special  wdrink 5 top 1 extra  

it an ok slice  decent size good crust sauc is averag they too  is this a trend  cut the sausag in long slice almost look like it peel  which i am not a fan of  give me the bite size chunk 

i will return to tri other item on the menulast saturday night was pretti hazi but somehow our group end up here  next thing i know i have a coney dog hand to me  i saw chees onion and chili on a hot dog and it was devour in less than 30 second  i had some chili land on my sneaker as a part gift although i am not sure it came from my dog  

25 second didnt fulli allow me to take the time and analyz the complex flavor of this world famous hot dog  but consid my state at the time if i had realli like it i definit wouldv gotten anoth one  i am not a big hot dog person  it would be my last choic of food at ani sport event or bbq  ill reserv hofman hot dog of syracus ny as the best one ive ever had and this was averag  not mani other hot dog option on fremont but id rather do mermaid for their atmospher pchada thai and wine goe for the upscal fine dine atmospher and pull it off well in my opinion  the servic is veri profession and the wine select is veri extens  i came here for lunch with a coupl of friend and order the tom kha khi 8 pad kee mao 8 sen mee kang pou 12 and moo hong 8 all order hot 

overal the food was good  i enjoy the pad kee mao with pork the most  it had a realli dri herbal flavor to it  the pork was moist and well prepar and the veggi were plenti and spot on  the balanc in flavor was well done while stay interest with intens herbal flavor  the moo hong pork belli in a soy sauc was good too although it tast kind of like a japanes dish  the pork was tender perhap slight dri but fatti and flavor  

i had mix feel about the see mee kang pou crab curri on ferment rice noodl and the tom kha khi  both dish use a peanut sauc to add sweet and i just am not use to that especi in a tom kha  still the flavor were nice and pop although perhap not super well balanc  i could have done without the peanut sauc in either dish  

this rate was a tough one for me  i enjoy the food well enough and the wine select was impress  howev the portion are definit small  the curri was serv in a small bowl the pork belli onli had about 8 small bite  the pad kee mao didnt have a lot of noodl a lot more veggi  although the pad kee mao was a realli fantast dish the other were around a 335 for me  combin with the low valu of the smaller portion i have to end up at about a 35  dont take my word for it though this is still a good thai restaur worth trijavier is a chain  theyv got a few here in so cal  you alreadi knew that though you dont need me  whi dont you need me  what did i do wrong huh  oh ok  back to the review  it face the casino near my dear roulett area the ambianc is super cool  dark  luxuri   good margarita though a bit too much ice for my tast  youll feel like your in some upscal resort in cabo  now the bad news  i thought the food was margin at best  also freakish pricey

i say go for drink and bar foodthis is the subway of pizza place you go to the glass and order your pizza just like you would your sub let me tell you what this place is good for

1 youv had too much to drink and you are walk out to the car taxi and realiz the onli thing in your neighborhood is mcdonald so you better eat now 

2 you  enjoy frozen pizza and dont know ani better this pizza tast like a frozen california pizza kitchen pizza

3 cheap 1299 for a pie

i ask for ranch dress he offer me caeser realli the coke machin need some help it tast like pure syrup would i eat here again probabl if i was in the same predica but not if im soberthis is not a secret pizza joint in the mgm grand  but you might total miss it if you never head down the escal go toward the self park garag  they offer person size pizza that you can custom from their list of top plus walnut and crasin which are not on their menu or get one of their preconceptu combo by number

they do not hand toss or shape the dough by hand  there is a near fool proof dough press that pretti much doe that befor they start build your pizza to order  on my visit i decid to get everyth on my pizza  the pizza took a littl longer to bake in their oven but came out tast pretti good bell pepper didnt have enough time to bake and wilt  for 12 it is a good deal for a restaur insid a strip casino

besid savori pizza they also offer 3 salad option classic caesar mix green and pizza salad  5  12

for dessert they can make dessert pizza too  nutella  berri sound most entic 4  6

soda with free refil  350

if you want relat inexpens casual meal while at mgm grand this is probabl your tastiest option  while you wait for your pizza to be deliv to your seat you can entertain yourself with random quot from anonym to jfk

servic was fast and friend  they were generous with the top but next time i will tri order my pie with all of their italian sausag anthoni m alreadi got dib on their pepperoni

on negat look out for the postclub crowd is that they close at 11pm  way too earli in my opinionwhat a surpris    i expect this place to be crawl with young colleg kid sorri colleg kid  but i was happi to find it full of profession come in on a friday night to check out the awesom happi hour

i stop in with 7 cowork on a friday  i was the first to arriv  i walk in and look around for a hostess stand noth  im do that distress what the hell do i do now look around  waitress walk past no one say anyth  i final flag someon down and ask is there a hostess stand   nope no hostess   you snag your own tabl  appar there is a sign outsid that i didnt see  get it togeth bar louie it take 3 second to say seat yourself when someon miss the sign it has to happen all day and i think they are veri silli for walk past me like they did  good thing i got there just befor 430 there was a huge 8 top tabl open and there were exact 8 of us come  

after seat myself a waitress stop by to show me the hh special and the menu  this is where this place realli made an impress hh 47pm  awesom food and drink deal  they had a hendrick martini on the hh 525  awesom 

i enjoy my appet calamari side salad and i had the dirti martini x 2  good deal total 18 buck  i am with it

mi return factor is 50  a definit return for hh after workit seem this is the place hipster go to get their pizza kind of like how gallo blanco is the hipster macayo  theyr so hip that they dont even put the name of the restaur on the build  that pretti much guarante an overinfl yelp rate becaus a lot of hipster have troubl think for themselv  but i digress

if you read my last few week worth of review youd know that i have been eat a lot of pizza late  we are on a sortof pizza quest  i had high hope for this one and the menu actual look realli awesom  i went with the casanova which is a white pizza with ricotta date arugula prosciutto and pecorino  i also had a ginger ale to drink

th ginger ale was probabl in the canada dri tier  that mean so flavorless that theyr will to serv it for free on an airplan  the differ between a fountain and microbrew soft drink is probabl more profound for ginger ale than ani other soft drink variety

a far as the pie goe the top were excel  go here if you like the focus of your pizza to be entir on the top becaus the crust suck  it was a littl too tough and the flavor was wors than ani other artisan pizza ive had  this was not knifeandfork pizza it was pickitupandeatit pizza  that how you know the crust is subpar

besid that the ambianc is a littl too modern  when i sit down for a nice handmad pie i like it to be warm and cozi  this place is trendi with loud music blast in the restaur  they need to dial it down a notch

of all the woodfir pizza i have had in phoenix feder was one of my least favorit  mayb better than cibo but not as good as pomo bianco or il bosco  or even timo flatbread pizza  the chef might be creativ but without a good crust or a good restaur eclect top becom a bit of a gimmick3 star just isnt high enough but the view doesnt realli deserv 4 star either

they offer a 15 discount when you checkin on yelp

on more ranti am still not a fan of tivoli  i like the atmospher of the view  i dont see how it fit in with tivoli and it half hazard theme  i am wait for the day that tivoli is twice as larg and hope that it find it ident along the waythe second establish to open by the same owner as poppi den in the last few month i dont know im still torn about this place first tri was a stop in after cocktail in anoth restaur in tivolith bartend had told us to stop in and check this new wine bar out so of cours we had to it situat insid the new market on top of brio so yes you do get a view but it of the valet drop off turnstil i did like the decor veri shabbi chic meet potteri barn the bartend dant was veri friend he direct toward the season wine list and recommend a french wine i had ask him if it compar to a sancerr he didnt know what that was now im not say you need to be a sommeli but if your a bartend work in a wine bar tri to sell me a 15 glass of wine you might want to know your wine a littl bit onto the food extrem overpr for the size yes i get it is tapa but come on high way robberi for exampl we order the nutella dessert cake for 9 it was liter 3 bite i ask for a chees list our waitress said they dont have one huh so it just a game of chanc whatev i order waitress choic she follow it up with yeah we should get one kinda funni i realli do love tivoli and i wish them the best but i dont see them last with these pricethere a lot of potenti here  let hope that potenti didnt vanish when the origin chef move over to rick moonen rx boiler room either way there room for improv the small plate menu has plenti of familiar item that will appeal to the mass and uniqu take on tradit dish like chicken pot pie nuggets

th space is rather odd as it an open restaur in the midst of a bunch of shop on the second floor of tivoli market but the furnitur is comfi and the view overlook the entranc and fountain at tivoli is decent especi at night

th charcuteri platter and select of chees were good but could have use a wider varieti the mushroom risotto was rich and creami but could have use more mushroom and season and a lot less truffl oil the tuna tartar nacho were nice present serv atop crispi wonton chip but the tuna didnt seem that fresh the fri chicken wasnt your typic bread bird it was closer to a roast chicken san bread with crispi skin it was nice season and one of the better dish we tried

it a great spot for a date night or a relax night with friend for a few drink the adjoin bar area was pack dure happi hoursinc im a huge fan of la flor de michoacan we decid to check this new ice cream shop out after kill some time at pet kingdom

w ask the gentleman behind the counter if this store was run by the same peopl run lfm and he said it was kind of a collabor effort between lfm and la bonita market  you would think the restaur lindo michoacan was associ becaus it said lindo instead of la flor

anywho i could definit see the similar and set up insid this shop look more similar to the lfm locat on the north side close to the broadacr event center and marketplac clean tabl and chair to sit at but lack a few thingsvarieti and taste

on four type of agua fresca and none of them be alfalfa similar flavor but miss my favorit pine nut    it like if i went to innout and couldnt order a neapolitan shake becaus they onli had vanilla so i got a scoop of mamey instead and wifey got a jamaica paleta which was way too tart and didnt have enough sugar to balanc out the flavor and my ice cream tast  like it had melt and was frozen again we descreet fed the garbag can and drove to the flagship locat on charleston and mojav where we know we could get what we were look for sometim it best to stick to your usual goto  spotsalohathe skinni prop for use proper tonkotsu ramen noodl howev the flavour of the broth just aint up the snuff their karaag on the other hand is a good portion size and pretti tasti 3 servic they mess up our order but it turn out okay becaus we were too full anyway 2 overal the tonkotsu ramen broth is still subpar but at least decent top are okay and reason price wouldnt go out of my way to eat here but if i was in the neighbourhood and have pregnancylik crave for ramen id give this place anoth shot3

found out about this place and head over for nice big bowl of japanes lovin

w order a tonkotsu miso ramen 820 fukumimi ramen950 karaag 390 and a curri bowl 390 

here is my analysi of the ramen

th broth meh  not enough porki fatti good in the broth  on the oink scale this would rank about a 610 scale  detect but definit not enough

th noodl  kudo for the actual legit tonkotsu noodl the straight white noodl mild overdon i prefer a littl more firm but definit get some mark for this

miscellan chashu  it okay  not your meltinyour mouth good but decent enough egg  good amount of runni  perfect cook top amount  decent amount given the price

th karaag was pretti good  nice crisp without too much coat and well season veri good portion size for the price too overal i think i enjoy the karaag better than the ramen actually

w never receiv our curri bowl the server forgot to put the order in but that was okay becaus we were fair stuf after finish our ramen and karaag 

to me what differenti the true great from a decent ramen place is the broth  and fukumimi ramen definit wasnt lickin the bowl clean kinda good for me it lack the soul perfect from a great ramen joint that be said it okay enough to fill the belli and the karaag was pretti good for that it get a 3 star reviewi realli cant say that i am a fan crucifi me all you want but no ramen place in town has been abl to touch monta i know they are differ type of ramen broth yada yada yadabut no ramen has left me crave for more like monta has 

this place is locat on the corner of trop and eastern in the burlington coat factori park lot next to baskin robbin i met jaim w here right as they open the staff was veri friend and the restaur clean and simpl yet modern i opt for the tonkotsu miso with extra side of chashu jaim went with their tan tan ramen my ramen was okay the piec of chashu were extrem fatti and fall apart the broth was veri salti without much flavor i finish my bowl as i felt it was okay not return worthi but not gag worthi either jaim left practic entir bowl untouch we also had a side of chicken kaarag of which i could not eat more than one small piec the meat was just so fatti and poor qualiti while also drench in grease

th coupl next to us with whom we struck up a convers were not pleas with their food either and left their bowl practic untouch mayb it was just a bad morn  the price were reason the server friend and when ask to split our check she didnt look at u like we just ask her to split an atom 

also dont go bath suit shop after eat a bowl of ramen just a head upwe came here on a monday even and order the
1 fukumimi ramen with egg and corn 
2 tan tan man ramen with egg and corn
for 25

 next to baskin robbin 
 no japanes chef yell welcom in their nativ tongu fail 
 tight seat uncomfort wooden chairs
 luke warm broth but hot noodl section of the soup had differ temperatur haha 
 small portion relat to price 
 great flavor savori porkesqu slight creami 
 half an egg onli just order extra for a full egg 
 1 for a full egg 50cent for can corn 
 null servic noth to realli discuss here is your drink soup and check 
 a bit too much fat on the pork belli for my like 
 i recommend the fukumimi ramen not too thick rich flavor and tast over tan tan
 tan tan had minc pork cheap broth was creami and noodl were differ compar to fukumimi
 stamp card for everi 4 ramen you buy you get 1 free serv of gyoza 
 5 would be shin sen gumi or ani socal equival 4 for monta then you have this place which is a decent altern just to tri someth differtri this place out for lunch and it was interestinglyveri uninterest  the place has been complet remodel and look great  it resembl a swanki pizza joint and has the bright airi open feel that the old restaur in it complet lack  it was pretti slow and we were greet and seat right away  the guy who seat us must have been one of the owner  he wasnt exact friend  i ask him how long they were open and he said just open a few day as he walk away obvious avoid small talk  

as someon els point out the 4 meatbal on the menu are actual 3 slight larger meatbal  reprint your menus  serious  the server seem complet unenthusiast about her job  im not ask for hard rock cafe enthusiasm ani of you whove ever eaten there know what i mean they are way too happi to be real server but at least smile and be friend   and anoth thing im a firm believ in  complet full disclosur upfront especi if your food menu is as short and simpl as meatbal spot  if you are out of someth as popular as fri pleas tell me now and dont wait til ive decid to order them and have work up an appetit and imagin of delici golden garlic butter cover fri melt in my mouth  serious  

anyway we order the beef meatbal and they were actual realli good  tender juici and the spici meat sauc was great too  the portion for lunch was perfect though i wish they would have given me just one more piec of garlic bread  the food was good and id probabl grab lunch there again sinc i work at town squar but i wouldnt go there for dinner and id never suggest it to anyon  while i have no complaint about the food the menu overal was veri bore and lack anyth that would make it last and stand out  these are just plain normal meatbal you could make at home if you have ani basic skill in the kitchen  the staff overal lack person result in a veri dull atmospher 

grant this was a 45minut lunch experi so id give it anoth shot howev with the fast pace of restaur come in and out of that spot im at a loss as to whi all the hard work would go into open a restaur and not put your absolut best foot forward  id be watch my staff like a hawk and make sure i have friend enthusiast outgo peopl  also they realli need to be on point which mean reprint your damn menus if your now onli serv 3 instead of 4 meatbal it just look so terribl on you especi sinc your a new restaur and judgi annoy peopl like me are go to be judg you up and down as if your the new makeov project on queer eye for a straight guy just sayinthis is a nice new addit to the other restaur choic around town squar  not sure what with all the one star review but i would put this at a solid 35 star  atmospher was pretti cool and the servic at the bar was fine

w went with the classic meatbal with spici tomato sauc not spici and mozzarella and also got an order of 3 beef meatbal with mushroom sauc top with provolon and fri egg  the chees and egg are a dollar extra and each bowl of meatbal come with a piec of bread  we also order the garbag salad which was a nice mix of salami chees oliv and the other usual suspect  

the meatbal themselv were damn good  the classic was veri tender with it be a mix of pork veal and beef  the beef meatbal were a lot more solid and went well with the mushroom sauc  we both wish there was more bread with the order and ask for an extra piec which they kind gave at no extra charg  mayb the meatbal sandwich is what id get next time  

it was also kind of weird to just have meatbal as a main cours for dinner  this seem like a snack place for me or you could go with split an order of meatbal and go for more side like pasta risotto or veget instead

i am not sure if they have happi hour but it sound like someth that would be a big hit herewent a few week or was it a coupl of month back when they had just open we are bay area transplant and the vibe of this place definit remind me of homesf restaur we were seat prompt and were abl to take in the decor of the restaur i think becaus we went so earli after it open that we didnt get to experi the best of honey salt although the food was good had the scallop servic was lacking

1 we had a constant rotat of busserswaitersserversim not sure what they were
2 we never got ani bread
3 slow on refills
4 long wait for food due to bad expedit and the worker seem to be run around like chicken with their head cut off
5 they deliv the wrong food to our tabl a coupl of times

employe look like they can wear ani type of top they want as long as it plaid so guy dont plan on wear plaid when bring a date here 3 star for the atmospher and food when we got it i would have rank it lower but we were in good compani and give them the benefit of the doubt that they have gotten better sinc will definit come back soon and see how thing have developi had high expectationsi alway screw myself when that happen but for all it hype honey salt just fell short for me

th servic was good everyth came out in a time manner and everyon was friend i like the decor too underst with a touch of elegance

th complimentari bread servic was delight a soft sweet whole wheat roll and crispi lavash but it was serv with a bland bean puré there a coupl of thing i have a problem with here i understand serv it with the lavash but the roll nah homey that thing scream for butter i ask for some and they oblig me also the puré had some crush pink peppercorn in it which to me didnt make sens culinarili and was a bit off putting

for an appet we share the new england fri a combin of clam with the belli and calamari im not sure what they batter them inmayb semolina or polenta but they werent as crispi as id like them to be the creami sauc had a littl kick which i like and it was serv with blister whole shishito chile i wouldv prefer them slice and pickl becaus the dish could use some acid overal the flavor was there but lack some finesse

mi wife order the salmon pretti ordinari it was also rare in the middl i like my salmon med rare or medium but this was rare the garnish peppadew sauc and quinoa pilaf were good by themselv but couldnt stand up to the big flavor of the fish overal this dish felt muddl and confused

i chose the scallop definit the star of the show the roast cauliflow and herb salad it was serv with were delici i did have some problem with this plate though let just keep vanilla where it belong shall we good in dessert doe not belong in my cauliflow puré also i detect no truffl flavor in the truffl sauc the scallop though were perfect cook and this more than made up for the minor indiscretions

th mac and chees was veri good as well i like that they ad some pepper and kale to it it gave the flavor a subtl veget qualiti which was welcome

overal the food fell flat kinda like this review mehpretti meh

i had heard all the hype about honey salt and it sound realli up my alleyperfect for me i went last night for restaur week and while it was a passabl meal it certain wasnt blow me away good 

servic this was great no problem with it

bread i was excit to get soft butter i hate when you get bread and the butter is frozen but unfortun the bread was super hard realli hard 

turkey meatbal this appet was actual pretti good you get 6 meat ball which is pretti beefi for an app i like the cold chees that came with them and overal would rank this high

chickenmac and chees here is where the real troubl start present was a bit odd the chicken come on top of the mac and chees and there is a brown sauc over everyth make the mac and chees a littl wateri the chicken was a littl overcook for my tast i am will to gambl cook wise to make sure the chicken tast moist and this chicken was veri well done you could see the stringi grain on the insid when you cut into it the skin was crisp and delici though 

desert this was the low point for me i got the appl pie and my roomat got the brooki the appl pie was sort of luke warm and a bit bland the vanilla ice cream was veri strong though and i appreci that the brooki we thought was a big disappoint it seem genius combin a warm cooki sunday with a warm browni sunday and on top of it salt caramel ice cream this seem like heaven but the devil is in the detail the cookiebrowni wasnt realli warm and the cooki be on top made it realli hard to eat as soon as you poke through the cooki which took some effort the whole thing sort of collaps the salt caramel ice cream is super strong tast which i like but my roomat did not 

overal i was disappoint but i will probabl give them anoth chanc sometim restaur week menus are not repres of the place and there were a lot of thing on the regular menu that sound goodi think i overhyp this place in my mind a restaur call pig and pickl can onli be absolut mind blow all of my friend agre so of cours this is now fact unfortun my mind was not blown 

we came for the late night menu and industri discount 15 off the atmospher is open and spacious with subtl pig artwork scatter here and there it got a small bar with a great select of craft beer and high end liquor the cocktail menu is a bit pricey but the drink are well made and pretti damn boozey the mai tai will knock you on your ass 

the servic was  eh the guy was super nice so i feel bad speak negat about him but fact is fact the drink took a notic long time to arriv and i would definit have order a second had the first one not take about ten minut to make an appear appar the bartend was space out i couldnt care less about a space out bartend i just want my alcohol

th food was good solid good but like i said i am not reel from the foodgasm of piggi good we order a round of tot with their special sauc for 1 each get them the fill chang daili and theyr creami and crunchi and comfort food delici think hush puppi mash potato megatot 

i had a hard time pick my meal becaus honest the whole menu look awesom i end up with a 9 burger youv got three choic for chees cheddar swiss or havarti i went with havarti and a side salad after think about it i opt to add bacon for 250 we had an entir convers about how dumb it would be not to add bacon at a pig place yeah well the guy forgot to add the bacon annoy i wasnt charg for it but i also realli would have like to eat it meh 

after the industri discount and my unnecessarili larg and guilt driven tip my meal alon cost a littl over 20 that kinda pricey for a late night meal especi with such underwhelm servic it frustrat becaus i like the guy and be in the same profess i understand want to be buddybuddi with a fellow server but dude do not mess up my meal or my drink then and onli then can we be friend 

i will come back for sure but im not kick babi and toss the elder out of my way to get therenot your typic ice cream parlor as this one featur asian flavor ie durian ginger and black sesam and veganfriend ice cream altern that attract our vegan friend from all over las vega  i have never had vegan ice cream befor and after tri the regular lyche ice cream then sampl the vegan version i conclud that i enjoy the creami of the vegan varieti more

th busi owner make ice cream in small batch on site and also suppli some of the local restaur in las vega  waffl cone are also made onsit so it will be a lot fresher than probabl 90 of the other ice cream shop in the entir 89xxx valley 

asid from ice cream you can get your boba tea fix here as well  

call ahead if you are plan on head over here dure the later part of the dayumm their bread is good their pepper tast like salt and the rest of the sandwich was eh but dont hold me to this i was kinda sickok long stori shortth line were crazi on some of the truck  i do not know how anyon can wait in a 30min line for food let alon a 4hr wait for some overhyp white castl burgers

th money add up quick too8 to get in we got the freebi though all cash truck and most dish avg 610  

the food was veri hit and miss even dish off the same truck  but there are some real winner here if you look hard enough and get lucky

her are the notabl food winner i ran into person

httpwwwyelpcombizphotoslasvegasfoodiefestsilvertoncasinolasvegasselectwrkhbisahlbmxg8x0qagbtve2jj8x7mtxic9noen6w

first off all just scope out somebodi that walk away with box of these thingsand offer to pay them for their time lol  i paid 10 for 2 of these thing but with zero wait and no sweati back  i dont quit understand all the hypeth meat tast artificialand make mcdonald seem gourmet  sorri for all the lover but ill stick with my in n out for fast food cravings

overal i would say it was worth the trip but i would not have wait for ani of these food truck for more than 20min personallyi am impati i guessnice famili own restaur with a larg menu of hawaiian influenc meal insid is veri clean and tidi they have some of the item up with pictur to help you make your select fish chicken beef shrimp salad soup burger and more

ord the bbq chicken and seafood mix combo it came with bbq chicken that was veri tender along with some fri white fish and shrimp this dish was serv on a bed of steam cabbag with a side of both white rice and macaroni salad 

i thought the food tast pretti good but it did not knock my sock off experienc what felt like a msg headach afterward as well hmmm

great valu and larg portion with parti tray and famili meal also avail they even have a dish call the loco moco with spam spam spam spam some fri egg smother in brown gravy

35 spam  i mean stari realli like what theyv done with this build  too often the mindset in phoenix is tear it down and rebuild  repurpos this old auto dealership was incred clever  there is a larg open area under the steel roof with foozbal and pingpong tabl in a gardenlik set  the main dine room is laid out with a casual arrang  encourag group and loud convers  the acoust howev not so good

w join some friend at the yard for some happyhour fun and dine at the new culinari dropout  the place was pack the line for the valet was at least ten deep and lead out of the full park lot  fortun we found a spot along a shadi street nearbi and walk over  sinc our friend were alreadi there we just walk right in the back entranc  the dine room is huge and airi veri industri look and with the kitchen tuck into a corner kinda remind me of north in arcadia  servic was prompt and effici more on that later

great beer select with some rotat microbrew draft can and bottl  odd duvel was list under the fruiti drink section  ok then  we start with a stella draft then split an order of pretzel ball that we dip into a hot minifondu of delici mild provolon chees  this was delici  for dinner we split the fri chicken dinner it seem to be someth everybodi was order judg from the tabl around us  after finish the stella and find duvel on the menu i natur switch to the more flavor beer  soon our dinner arriv conveni split onto two plate despit that we did not ask for this

th chicken was tender and juici with a crispi bread that was flavor with hint of pepper and buttermilk the mash and gravi was creami and good and the coleslaw was savori and a good compliment to the chicken  there was a honey biscuit and it tast kinda like the honey got smear all over the plate as the chicken hint honey flavor as well  this is where thing start go downhil for the service

th place was pack when we arriv and the nois level was about shout what repeat to the person seat next to you  intim dine experi this is not  after deliv the dinner we didnt see anybodi until the busboy and waittress came to clear the tabl  well to be fair she did breez by to make sure our meal were ok  three diner were finish one was not  they clear all the plate but for the finish diner leav the lone diner to feel pressur to wrap it up  bad form cd  so i scarf the rest of my meal   the busboy then return sever time sneak in to remov empti glass without ask or offer a refil  the impress we got was at odd with the feel of the restaur it cozi with sofa and chair fun game to play outsid yet you are not encourag to stay a while and mayb order a dessert or an afterdinn drink

i would give this place an easi fourstar for the food but the intrus servic realli detract from the enjoy  perhap friday even dure happi hour is not the best time to dine here im realli torn on how to rate the yard i realli like the concept and while it has an unusu layout it nonetheless a fun place to come hangout to drink perhap grab a bite and then take in some live music while tri to play ping pong when youv got a good buzz go hit the one in the middl rock

i came here for brunch and had a decent french dip at culinari dropout the dine experi was all just ok 

so i think what im tri to say is four star for concept idea atmospher plus two star for less than great food and servic averag out to three stars

our main server was actual veri friend and enthusiast but his colleagu in charg of bring our drink in a time manner left a lot to be desir i had a prime rib dip which was good but memori of philipp in downtown la and even the french dip at chelsea kitchen ensur that the prime rib dip here did not measur up as with most fox restaur the dessert was out of the park so well done there

i will definit return to the yard and would recommend it but it with the understand that you probabl wont be blown away by the food and the servic may not be complet up to par hope onc the busi is more establish the servic will improv this is one of those place where youll take a hit on the food and servic so you can enjoy a fun uniqu atmospheri enjoy this place simpli for the bustl atmospher the vibe is usual a posit one and i admit i alway have a pretti decent time here howev i went recent after the second portion of the restaur open and it was a clusterfuck i dont think anyon who work there anticip the size of the crowd with 2 restaur oper everyth was extrem slow peopl seem cranki the food was not veri stagger and took age to arriv and the wait was 2 hour to even be seat it was pain obvious they werent prepar for that amount of people

aft spend someth like 3 hour wait and final eat we ventur over to the game area this was pointless way too mani peopl were play and be extrem selfish rather than play a few game of cornhol and relinquish the bag to someon who was wait peopl would play like 14 game dude serious dont be a dick there need to be a rule that say that play and have fun but dont be a selfish dick eventu around 30 minut befor close we got to play ping pong hurray and that bring me to anoth point  whi are you close at midnight i understand have the kitchen close at that time that not unusu but the entir bar it bizarr 

luckili the crowd i was with is a blast and kept each other occupi while we stood wait our turn to play one of the game we ventur over to pomeroy afterward that place is probabl thank it lucki star the yard opened

bottom line is if you go here on the weekend ani time of the day it a long wait and so crowd it almost not enjoy it was better befor the second spot open i dunno if ill go back there a lot of option in this area where i dont need to spend 5 hour wait and eat littl woodi is a much better option for game and vovomeena kill it for breakfast and i can actual parkunion is veri cool in theori i love royal coffe so it is nice that they have a second locat here although somewhat redund sinc they alreadi have a locat at the biltmor the littl cafe smell veri good the store are cute and the set up is interestingsort of like a public market or someth where there are mani small counter busi or storefront my problem with union is that it claim to be all local becaus the store are local store howev there are item in some of the store that are simpli bought from corpor compani for exampl i tri on some dress from the cute littl cloth store and overheard the owner talk to some random supplier and say someth along the line of just bring anyth i dont even care the brand are not local and the cloth are not local made i think if union realli want to be a local establish the busi should sell local made local sourc item otherwis it is just indirect buy corpor madein china item i know some of the store have put forth a lot of effort to do this queen creek oliv mill franc etc which is appreci but as a unit i think they could do moreyes i also attend the soft open  everyon there was excit and so friend  the actual grand open is tomorrow so it will be interest to see how they did  

we just had to tri the guacamol made at the tabl  the guacchick was awsom  they give you all kind of option while prepar it  it was fantasticneed a littl salt for my tast but pretti darn good  chip light and crispyhomemad  salsa just ok

for entre we order a chicken salad steak pablano pepper and pork taco  all delish  the chicken salad was full of flavor  the steak pablano pepper not sure if that was what it was call was great  the pepper stuf with chees shrimp onion and mushroom sandwich by a thin steak  wow  realli wow  yum  the taco were good and flavorful too  my daughter order the corn dog hahakid which they serv honey mustard with which i thought was weird lol  

the decor was veri blah  they sat us in the back face a wall with noth on it odd kind of ambianc  kadenc was our waitresssh was fabul  like i said everyon was fantasticon their best behavior still learn everyth and get to know each other but seem like a good futur team 

the best thing was the browni  they said it take six yes six hour to make  what  they prepar the browni with some kind of cream sauc and ice cream on a skillet right at your tabl  unbeliev  it sound like alot of their dessert were special made like that  at the tabl  veri special kind of dessert  i onli plan to have a coupl bitesuh yeah that didnt happen  hahah  bet you would say the same and chang that thought

3 star becaus they are not open yet  we will have to tri it one more time to see  the price seem a littl highwel some on them  our bill would have been about 90 with a margarita and a glass of wine  it worth a shot at least onc   not sure when we will be back but if we do i will updat this review  cheermy sister and i were out and about and i have been starv i was readi to pass out good thing they gave us chip and salsa i was not hungri for mexican food sinc i wasnt feel well anyway i just want some fri we order quesadilla al cangrejo asada y enchilada and torta de carnitas

if you want gringo mexican food this place might work for you ive had better food and paid less money somewher elsfirst let me say that i luv that there a ramen place near my hous  finally
oh and it right next door to yummi bachi burger  now a yummi japanesehawaiian bakeri just need to open next door to these 2 place and im good

th insid is on the small side but not as small as other ramen place  i live in sf for a few yrs and there are way smaller restaur  almost tiny

again just like the last ramen place we ate at the decor of wood wooden chair tabl ect seem to be the trend right now

th waitress and waiter were veri attent  constant give us new water even though we werent finish with the water we alreadi had

i ask the bf about what someth was on the menu and waitress heard me and answer my question right away  that was good know that she was pay attention

gyoza  differenttasti but need to be cook longer an order consist of 8 piec and by the time we got to the 6th piec i notic that the insid was not hot and too soft so when i spit it out i saw that it was still raw the waitress show the chef and i was ask if we want a new order but we declined

 i orderd the lobster ramen onli sad to be told that they were out of lobster  that suck 

so i settl on the miso ramen while ad butter corn for 200 which i think is too much  for corn and fri garlicth noodl were perfect firm and yummi i enjoy the noodl the broth to me couldv had more tast  i know that i couldv ad soy sauc ect but i like eat food at a place that im pay for without have to add flavor im not say that i didnt like it  i just think the broth need more something

th bf had the spici miso ramen which had chasur gingerkaiwarefri garlicspinachgreen onion chile thread menma and nori now one look at this soup and it look like a parti go on in that bowl i tri the broth at it was ok as well i like the spinach and all the addin 
the bf was a littl turn off by all the addin while i on the other hand was turn on by it
i love pickel plum so i was happi to know that you get a pickl plum in your soup but i think they shouldv use seedless plum caus if your not care you could hurt yourself chop down on one

i was given a complementari scoop of their black sesam ice cream probabl becaus of my raw gyoza i am thank though for the icecream i like the ice cream  yes it was differ and a bit weird at first but onc you get over the weird it actual yummy

i think the price of the appet should be cheaper though

so while our first visit was ok i will return to shoku ramenya again and hope get to tri the lobster ramenkarag chicken wing even though i hate wing and the fri rice look good as well i like to give all new restaur a 2nd tri befor i count them out becaus just like a new babi  there need to be time to grow 0 crawlwalk then runi work in the area and have been pass by the open soon sign for way too long it took me a littl bit to get here onc they open but i final made it

i came here today for lunch with a cowork and we were greet quick and seat the server took our drink order quick and brought us a caraf of ice water which they never let get even half empti befor refil it i order the spici miso ramen with corn and my lunch partner order the tonkatsu the noodl were nice and i realli enjoy the fresh corn and pork the broth was a tad salti but everyth els was realli good the salti broth was the onli thing keep me from give this place a four star review i had to avoid drink too much of the broth sinc it was make me thirsti 

im by no mean a ramen expert but i know what i enjoy and asid from the salti broth i like this place sinc i work in the area i expect to come by pretti often and i look forward to tri the other version so i can hope find one that is not as saltishoku ramenya is the 5th or 6th ramen place ive been to in las vega so this is an overal comparison

cam in on sunday for lunch and was abl to get seat right away here the run down on what me and my parti got

 garlic butter bacon fri rice yumo the descript on the menu couldnt get ani better right when the dish came out i could smell the oili garlicki bacon good yes it might have clog up an arteri or two but to me it was well worth it howev after we left the restaur my parti couldnt stop ahem ahem from all the oil appar obvious it was my fault for order it but i didnt expect all the mucusphlegm to be come up from my throat asid from the ahemahem i thought the dish was quit tasty

 tonkotsu ramen first off i realli dislik the noodl here i like thick chewi noodl and these were more on the thin side which some peopl love but just arent for me the broth itself howev was on a a good salti level but like other have said lack depth and rich of the pork bone flavor the chasu was alright wasnt a melt in your mouth kind of feel 

butasan ramen broth was even less impress than the tonkotsu ramen the egg howev was done to perfect 

overal i wouldv given this place 4 star except i left ahemahem tri to get the mucus out of my throat with all the ramen place up pop up i think there are other better optionmy teenag son and i visit durin open week  the locat was easi to find and park was decent  the dine area was beauti decor in green and gold with great attent to detail  upon enter a server ask us how mani then point and told us to sit over there um  ok  we sat where direct  our unfriend server approach the tabl quick and ask for our drink order as we finish order drink she ask if we were readi to order our lunch  have eager anticip the open of this restaur i knew exact what i want and order immedi  my son wasnt quit so quick to order so it took him a minut  i order the red curri lunch special and my son order the pad thai lunch special  our soup came out fair quick and was slight cooler than a soup would normal be but the flavor made up for it  our entre came at about averag speed and were nice present  the appear of the pad thai made me rethink my curri until i tast it  we both order our entre mild sinc mild is subject and we knew we could add spice if need  the pad thai was so spici tear immedi sprang to my eye  my son gave a valiant effort at eat it but soon gave up  the chicken in his meal was delici but my eatwhateverdoesnteatmefirst carnivor son said the beef tast off and the textur was funni  i didnt tri it
mi red curri was outstand  big chunk of eggplant red pepper green bean and chicken made it visual appeal as well as delici  my mild red curri was slight too mild but there was no way i was go to ask for more spice after tast my kiddo meal
dur our entir visit a server did not visit our tabl one time to check on our meal or to refil water which my son desper need  
the meal was a bit expens 20 for lunch specials
i will definit tri tom yum again hope for a better experience

p as we were leav an elder coupl came in and were told to sit wherev you want  the coupl chose a tabl by the window which they didnt see until they sat down that it was dirti  when they ask the server to clean the tabl she told them to sit over there instead  they told her that they would prefer to sit by the window  she clean the tabl but clear was annoyim no connoisseur to southern fri chicken but i can onli compar it to lolo the more popular chain here  for me the differ was in the waffl  if it was crispier i would have given them 1 more star  now chickentochicken lolo is slight crispier  overal i enjoy the chicken  it had a light thin batter with a fragrant of various spice and herb  the meat was not as juici but was moist enough  

i order their 4 piec thigh leg wing and breast meal with waffl which came out to approx 10  it came with 2 side of syrup and liquid butter  that right liquid butter  

the menu is quit extens so one cant be bore with just fri chicken  i would not mind make a return if im in the mood for chicken and wafflwe were surpris that this one was cute compar to the more hole in the wall origin locat 

the bf and i share the pineappl curri with shrimp the curri was red curri coconut base which was decent it was a bit too tangi for me but it was well made and had a good amount in shrimp pineappl and veggi in it it come with just a cup of rice we had to ask for anoth cup which is extra per cup 

spici thai noodl  think of it similar to pad se ew but with other veggi like cabbag tomato carrot onion in it it wasnt veri spici though in fact they didnt ask us about our spice level at all but mayb then they assum to go mild i should probabl ask next time 

for the portion these were cheap a few dollar less than the averag go rate the flavor i thought was decent i dont know what it was about it but i rare get heartburn and did it was odd is all 

servic was just ok we came an hour befor their close 20 minut befor close is kitchen last call and when we enter they kinda seem a bit bum we show they werent the most attent given we were the onli one there but there were take out order come through still i had to walk up to get my bill sinc the 3 peopl in the front were all busi do someth the food came out lighten fast which was a plus but also was mayb so we can get done fast 

i was confus how this place didnt have a bathroom but i thought sit there how weird that was i did see on some peopl review there is a bathroom you just have to walk to it on the side or someth 

there sever item on the menu that is uniqu to them combin with a great pricepoint that make it a good cheap option that in a conveni of a area for us im sure we will be back for more biteok here j j north countri buffet  this is appar just a name onli that get tack onto various buffet around the countri  they dont seem to have ani locat corpor headquat anywher  buffet inc  hometown buffet old countri buffet  other doesnt say boo about ani j j north restaur on their websit     o

ok so whatev j j north is what we have here is hometown buffet almost exact as it was befor except that they have restor it in term of manag qualiti sinc my last visit here on 11110 when they had drop from 4 star all the way to two be generous

today i was join by ursula d robyn n  mike c  the food select is reduc some from when hometown was at it best here but there were also not too mani diner  they can onli put out food accord to the busi volum they current have  with that said everyth was serv up attract and kept proper stock while we were here the food  dine room temperatur were right  everyth tast fine especi the fri chicken pork chop  the hot lava cake and the staff was friendly

now that this buffet is back to complet ok overal i hope they get back the custom lost when they allow the qualiti of manag to go down the drain to where there were no spoon avail food was left slop all over the place in the serv area  so on  then they can increas the food select to includ thing such as cottag chees greek pepper  the other item they use to have  return to 4 star  meanwhil it good to see thing improv here     

weekday lunch buffet is 829779 sr and there a banquet room that can accomod up to 100 guesti was excit to tri pho here sinc they open after hear about it and pass by after it open the yelp review were promis as well i went with fellow yelper heather s as we were in the mood for hot soup on that cold night 

the decor is nice bright and clean and i like the open view kitchen so that you can see the cook move about while make everi one food 

i was in the mood for someth with shrimp in it and for pho there were onli two option for seafood they had the seafood pho which had shrimp scallop and imit crab or tom pho which is what i order that onli had shrimp

th pho noodl and the broth were good howev my littl shrimp had been cook to death overcook then fill in a bowl with boil hot water just kill it as those shrimp never had a chanc to be good that is a pet peev of mine over cook seafood is a deal breaker and will ruin a meal as shrimp should not be hard as a rock and chewi i do not suggest order the tom pho

i did like the fresh spring roll with the peanut dip sauc and my lyche flavor ice tea was a winner

if you do not see a combin that is list you do have the option to creat your own up to three meats

ther is no atm in this restaur they refer you across the street of crazi busi spring mountain to a well fargo bank atm i have no idea whi previous review state there is an atm locat insid of the restaur when there is not 

also no credit card transact are accept for less than 2000 so it made it sort of complic for us go dutchwhip over here and enjoy a lunch outing today with mark r  robyn n  it a simpli decor midsiz cafe with a friend host and reason price  the menu though in my opinion is a disast case veri hard to follow and order from  that my big complaint about this restaurant

onc i manag to order a coupl of thing i went with a street style asada taco 130 and a plate of three quesadilla one with spici chicken one with beef chees and mushroom and one with marin pork 6  all three were cover with shred lettuc and bit of chees and there was a nice sauc float around on the plate underneath

th serv of chip for the three of us was dinki even though we were brought a few more later  they were paper thin  the rest of the food was veri good so it a high 3 star overal for this nice place     

cash onlithe green valley ranch panda express suffer from two flaw flaw 1 there is far better sitdown chines restaur at compar price within a mile radius they includ new york chines restaur  china go go and china tango flaw 2 oftentim this place suffer from one of the flaw of the panda express chain this is the near empti and greasi food serv tray this give a veri unfavor impress and has result in me skip over eat here a few time in the past

   the major strength of the green valley ranch panda express has go for it is conveni green valley ranch is a hot spot of bar peopl drink in bar and get buzz to the point of not be abl to safe oper a car panda express is a decent option for this captiv audienc it is also conveni for peopl who dont want to leav the casino or are go to the movies

  i use to be a fan of panda express yelp has enlighten me to all these chines restaur that are better i now see panda express as a fast food chines restaur of conveni instead of worthi of a special trip

th 2013 yelp 200 challeng review 109walk over here after a delight meal next door at the noodl place bday girl want someth sweet and tasti i have never seen a place like this befor simpl menu and some interest ingredi hmmm

i have alway like ice cream frozen yogurt or just a smidgen of that midwest delici custard this place is a bit differ and at the same time a one of a kind experi more of an asian twist if i can say so nice

everyon order someth differ you pick the size flavor of the base ingredi and then what top you like then you choos a glaze to finish it off they also sell milk tea and ice teas

i order a regular size origin with mochi ball almond pud cover with black sesam top one of the famili member order someth with a mango and chocol combo kinda of thingi go on i did not ask what the bday girl got but the granddaught like it so much she shot a spoon across the room onto the wall napkin please

al around cool concept with some interest flavor combin i like the game play area as well just kick back and chill if time permit game on

35 starhmm  this is definit not for me  this dessert is a littl bland for an american tast  i guess i have live here too long and i crave a lot more sweet  i agre with evan the price and wait is a littl much not worth my time or money  the dessert look realli pretti and that is whi i bump it up a notch but i will not be come back  after eat the top part that had condens milk and the strawberri i pretti much left the rest  i am sure they are not go to miss me anywaythe unexpect locat of this restaur surpris us  it nestl in between a gas station and other industri look store  weird locat  didnt stop us from go  noodl and dumpl are a major weak of mine so upon find out that this new place serv juici pork dumplingsxiao long bao we were there  servic was friend for even american standard and they even check in on us a few time and ask whi didnt finish our onion pancak more on that later

i was jones for some fresh soy milk but they had ran out of it  oh well stick with good ol cleans hot tea  on to the food

1  thick fri noodl  chewi noodl essenc of wok hei and savori flavor of soy sauc  this seem more like a amerines a la panda express but ad in some vinegar and hot sauc we were happili slurp all the noodles
2  onion pancak  we enjoy the overal crispi but what was lack was more flaki layer  concern they ask us whi we did not finish the pancak we had to lie that we were too full to eat it but truli even if we were full our glutton selv would have made room had it been more flaky
3  xiao long baojuici pork dumpl  clear flavor juic thin chewi skin  impress for the las vega area  as alway we must compar to famous din tai fung the skin wasnt as thin an membran and the volum of broth was less voluminous

conclus  for the las vega area it certain not the best but this will do for my xlb cravethis is definit the nicest asian restaur off the strip  the decor plate and cleanli set bund apart from ani other place on spring mountain

th star of the show was their lion head meatbal   you get 4 basebal size meatbal that are so soft moist and bring back childhood memori   the meatbal are burst with flavor and youll want to drench the sauc and mop it up with a bowl of rice   these meatbal are so good an italian grandmoth would be proud  and for less than 10 it is a steal  i will be back for lion head for sure

a for the xiao long bao soup dumpl that was a much differ stori  for those who are fan of the xlb you obvious have not tri 3 villag locat walk distanc around the corner   the xlb here had littl to no soup and the meat was not well season  last the wrapper was over thick  i would expect much more here   if you dont believ me go ahead and do a tast test  order a xlb here and immedi walk over to 3 villag same plaza as veggi hous and island malaysia  upstairour hike group goe to chinatown for a new year lunch each januaryfebruari  today we went to bund shanghai  one of our group had been here and she like it veri much  she arrang the lunch ahead of time  sinc shes from taiwan there is never a languag problem when were with her in chinatown

for lunch the 10 of us share these shanghai style dim sum select soup dumpl xlb  crab and pork soup dumpl pan fri pork bun beef fri bun pot sticker spici won ton rice cake stir fri with pork and cabbag shanghai fri thin noodl red bean pan cake and eight treasur rice pudding

al of us like the food veri much  i found the xlb to be a bit bland  my favorit was the shanghai fri noodl  id go back just for that

servic was excel  shirley spoke with the staff for the most part but the hostess and one of the server had great english so wed be ok if we went without shirley

th restaur is veri nice appoint  it not veri larg but can hold sever larg parti like our at their larg round tabl  the park lot is veri veri small

i have to come back and tri this for a regular dinner not just dim sum to get a better feel for the dish  but this was a veri good lunch

edit  my photo dont do justic to most of the dish  i was sit in the wrong section of the circl and those from our group start dig into the dish befor i could get a photo of the entir dish  plate was veri nice donecheck this place out sinc we were in the area taco are 150 each and we tri the cabeza and al pastor to see how it stack up with the competit 

the meat were pretti good but pretti skimpi the tortilla were slight dri and on their way to hard

would i be back not like know that taqueria el pastorcito still own the street follow by taqueria el buen pastorform taco el pastorcito imoalohathe taco stand here has level up and is now a full blown trailer  i dont know if it mean differ owner but the menu look a bit differ from when it was just a stand  the meat also tast a bit differ when it was a stand i realli like the pastor  current their cabeza is my favorit meat

taco are around 150 each order are serv up fast and there is a full salsa bar  there are no tabl or area for seat so youll be eat outsid or in your car  the onli frustrat thing about this place is that the hour dont seem to be consist  ive driven past on friday or saturday night expect them to be open but either they havent set up yet or they have alreadi close  still this is one of the better taco stop that ive had in this part of towncute littl french bakeri and café locat is in same area as paymon but if your not care and pass it youll have to turn around becaus the remax lot next door doe not connect and has sever youwillbetow sign up

insid is clean and organ with cute wooden wicker seat and lot of cute art post on the wall there even a water spout with lemon and orang cut up insid for selfserv hydrat pastri in case look tasti almost got an onion tart or a fruit tart but opt instead for the croqu monseiur sandwich as suggest by the cashier along with an ice white chocol mocha

sandwich was veri rich and indulg as it typic is flavor were tasti but sandwich itself didnt sit well with me was plate with a small side salad with a tasti housemad dress coffe was ice sweeten and caffein which is exact whi i got it

sid note about the music initi came in to a few rapclub style song play but the music eventu return to quieter more caféappropri select odd there a nice patio that is shade from the sun set behind the build would be nice for spring or fall dine alfresco but in this summer heat it like wont be use ofteni saw that the review of nosh was either realli promis or realli negat i decid to see for myself and to my surpris i understood whi this separ in partisanship is 
mi attempt to walk in unbias was fair success i felt that the ambianc was nice and cozi the menu was limit and not as innov as i had expect beer and wine select seem fair and i did have my sampl of some interest brew over my parti visit 

the happi hour
do not wast your time hast to fit the window becaus if you do you may partak in their happi hour deal these are a crock i had three 
the fanci rice ball  wasnt good other in parti did like it 
deep fri artichok  exact what it sound like and pointless
shrimp cocktail  wast of dish 

the food
w had sever order of differ sampl of the bruschetta not special not bad 
the charcuteri chees board not impress 
the nosh i expect the namesak of the establish to be good edgi andor esperiment i was wrong
dessert serious and remark unimpress nutella on toast is breakfast in germani 

sentence
i had a great time here the servic from the door on is fine the food was overal a disappoint but the beer select is fair the ambianc is nice and i like how it is decor and everyth 

peopl that come here for an escap might get what they came for and thus give this place a high rate i dont blame them becaus that how i feel but if you come and believ that an establish that call themselv gastropub and let the limelight shine down on chef stacey  i becom far from impressed

i want to like nosh i want to like it a lot if it was more pub and less castro i would have just written it off as that now i cannot due to the fact that the proport are the veri opposit chef stacey i want to be impress but i was let down if there is one think i can be a dilettant connoisseur on it pub food i will come back but onli to nosh the pubill leav my review at 3 star for now  this was my first visit to a panera bread to get sandwich for dinner  we need a break from get sub at differ place and i chose to tri someth new  this locat open recent  it make where i live about halfway between to panera but i decid to tri this one

servic was great at the counter but the wait seem long for the take out until i realiz they had a number of peopl eat in who had order just befor i got there  i brought the sandwich home and they were veri good  my wife had their cuban chicken panini and i had the signatur steak and white cheddar  they were both veri good  my panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich  with the sandwich i opt for the small bag of chip for each of us

th order was packag realli nice in two small cardboard box  my onli complaint with this is there realli no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the content  some place put a number sticker on their sandwich to match the item on your receipt  the box at panera have a place you could write the name  i sent a suggest to hq and the respond that theyd look into it

il return and i think ill eat in  the dine room is veri nice and there outdoor seat for when it cooleri wish i could rate this higher along with most of you i love support local restaur and busi  especi if it a breakfast joint howev while the food was decent noth about my experi realli stood out 

walk in my friend and i were the onli one in there except for one person seat at the counter about to leav i wasnt sure whether the lack of custom was becaus the food was bad or simpli becaus it was late morn on a thursday 

i end up get the breakfast slider due to mani good review of it here on yelp yes the biscuit were fresh and yes they were good but overal the dish was just meh my sausag was super oili and the potato were underseason as for my coffe super burnt which is usual a huge indic that it just been sit on the warmer for quit some time it was complet and utter undrink 

sad to say i probabl wouldnt recommend this spot next time my friend and i are tri to find somewher to eat but if ani of them want to tri it i wouldnt be oppos to give it a second chancwas in the area becaus i got sucker into stop for some pie those dang sign and was walk toward the gas station and saw herb  more now i love herb shop  they are quit interest for me it amaz me on how herb can be use for natur cure  

the real reason whi i stop in was for the  more i was look crystal sometim they are sold were herb are at and i want to check out what they had  unfortun i didnt find ani but the store doe have a lot of offer i did see a lot of herb even have dragon blood if you are look to cook up a love spell dragon blood i heard is help haha 

it was a nice shop full of help inform and im sure if you came in with a real need the sale ladi would be more than help for find what you seeki am a huge burger fan  i mean i love burger love them more than anyth in the world  in fact i think that my overwhelm love of burger kind of make me an expert  with that said the burger here was good  there were just a few thing that could have been chang to make it great

i order the farm burger and like the rest of my group it was cook just north of medium  also the fri egg that was suppos to ooz as i bite into my burger did not ooz  it realli bare squish a bit  that was most disappoint  despit the slight overcook patti and the nonooz fri egg the burger was good  if those two thing had been on par it probabl would have been freakin delici  along with the burger we also order the sweet potato fri and the garlic parmesan fri and both were great but ordinary

our server was awesom  she was nice and super knowledg about the menu and happili answer each and everi question we had with extrem detail  

oh yes and the last thing i want to mention is that our food took a realli long time to come out at least 40 minut  i want to love this place becaus im a huge gordon ramsay fan but i would say that with the amaz burger all over vega sad i probabl will never returnwhen i saw the there was an elit event for this i was over joy then more bum when i had to take back my rsvp becaus i couldnt attend the entir event my babi sister onli could babi sit til 12  boooohoo

 anyway im not one to let an opportun pass me by so the same night as the event i went and had dinner here i even saw misti set up the tabl and she was awesom e nought to give me yelp mint and congratul me for still come to dinner here

now onto the meal

it wasnt as good as befor bummer the fri were over salti and chees and came out cold the burger was delici and warm but lack season 

it took forev to get us refil and i was a veri upset at the hostess stand my friend made a joke and one blond roll her eye and ignor my husband question and continu gossip with three other hostess i realli dont get whi there 8 hostess that crazi and dumb three was more than enoughmore like 35 star but my burger realli drop it back to 3

this is a smaller restaur compar to ramsay gourmet steak hous in pari but it is casual and more invit servic was good and we ordered

farm burger the duck bacon honest tast like normal bacon there realli wasnt much of a chang from bacon burger still quit a hearti meal as bacon tast wonder be it duck or pig

earth burger my portabello shroom burger was fill with these yummi shroom and it was bunless make it look slight wimpier than my friend burger i didnt mind though but when i bit in the shroom were incred salti to the point where i almost didnt want to eat it mayb i should have ask for no chees as it may have enhanc the salti of the shroom but oh man it was also veri oili also possibl due to the melt chees and i realli felt like i didnt have a good meal

just fri definit no soggi fri here i think i would have prefer the fri to be thicker but it was still good the curri ketchup was the favorit at our table

sweet potato fri i normal dislik fri with sugar but the vanilla powder sugar realli made the differ delici especi with the honey mayo i kill this appet easili and with joy 

overal this is a good restaur but i think next time i will need to ask them to halv the sodium and nix the cheesive been die to tri gordon ramsey burgr  it was semi hard to find at first becaus it wasnt on the directori i love be abl to go grab some fat tuesday while wait for our tabl they send you a text when it readi sooo much easier than stand in line hangri it was an hour and half wait at around 330pm on a saturday after buzz and chill we got the text and was seat immedi server were great and attent  

we order the truffl parmesan fri which was delici love the truffl aioli sauc it came with the ketchup was differ bun bao was delici as well but not mind blow caus well we arent in an authent asian restaur  

i got the farm burgr medium rare becaus of the popular on yelp not sure if i was full or too buzz off of some fat tuesday but it was mediocr at best  the beef was extrem soft but the burger was a bit bland wish i had some aioli in there 

would definit still come back and tri a differ burger next timeveri cute littl brunchbreakfast place bonus it down the street from my hous lol 

we were so hungri so we liter want everyth on the menu lol i order the chilaquil it has chicken sour cream chees and top with egg ani style this was quit yummi but it was spici omg im a wuss so i was die someon shouldv warn me becaus it didnt say it on the menu i think it wouldv been better if it wasnt so dam spici for me my friend order the wolfpack this come with hashbrown chees bacon and egg we top it with gravi which made it delici 

we wash everyth down with mimosa i like the mimosa here for 5 you get a pretti good size glass not one of those skinni champagn glass that it come in ill definit come back to tri some more item on there let me start by state that i enjoy an occasion hot dog everi onc in awhil mayb it just me but never understood all the hype with pink  whether it pink in la or ph when it come to their dog they are just okay  minus all the top and all you realli get a skimpi hot dog  keep in mind i dont even think a dodger dog is ani better  in my opinion 7eleven has better dog at the fraction of the price  there i said it 

all is not lost though  the nondog menu is pretti good  from their breakfast burrito to their burger all are price just about right for what you get  they even have a decent chicken sandwich  iron that theyr known for their hot dog but i think theyr overpr junk  but the other stuff on the menu is worth it  by the way their breakfast burrito is my favorit  it a pretti big serv with egg bacon and potato wrap in tortilla  

as for the restaur it locat between the sport book and poker room locat conveni where you will find me when i am at red rock  the restaur is clean and realli onli get crowd when a good game is go on ie 49er play  you get a great shot of the big screen  

i will still recommend pink if you havent had it befor  you be the judg  but if you been here befor tri someth other than their dogthis is the latest incarn of what use to be phoenix orient market which in turn was the reincarn of manila supermarket befor that same build same layout includ the littl eateri now call pho thu pari serv vietnames dish in the southwest corner of the market it has a fair varieti of asian groceri item seafood and produc again not much differ from when it was phoenix orient market this store is definit not as big as asiana lee lee or super l ranch but it is suffici for find most thing you need to prepar most asian dish at home the price are low to modernew locat 

this place is close to work so me and the cowork stop in  

good  locat and staff look realli busyhard workingdec cheap drink and food  

bad  they were out of about 25 of the menuunprepar and the food just wasnt that good  i feel sorri for peopl that come to az and have mexican food at place like this  even the rice and bean simpl thing are just mediocr and have no charact  

im get the vibe this is definit more of a drink spot than a food spot  after a few drinksmayb everyth will tast better  
this place need a littl time to get it act togeth im hopeive been to chop shop a few time now and while i appreci a new relat inexpens healthi place to grab a bite to eat im just not super impress 

the first time i went i wasnt veri hungri and was hope for a yummi juic or smoothi i do like how they offer cold press juic and am look forward to tri one someday i pick a fruiti smoothi i believ call the beach burn it was alright but absolut not worth 6

on my next visit i pop in for a quick bite befor work they deliv my girl friend sandwich signific befor mine even though i order first which was annoy but not the end of the world i had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich and my friend had the club both were good just noth to write home about in my opinion 

ill probabl give chop shop one last tri to find someth i realli like becaus as i mention it not too pricey and within walk distanc of my worka new chain come to the centr of town and upon enter their upstair restaur im redirect downstair via the front door and down to the basement entranc to then take a seat ask where the toilet are to then be told to go upstair via the intern stair a bit confus and a messi start but hey

bar soba is a fusion asian and bar chain that has arriv in edinburgh i would have prefer their arriv to be when they were readi to open both the upstair and downstair and without the toilet be hidden amongst a build site given how sleek and togeth their decor and refurb has been it was a bit out of keeping

anyway that two whole paragraph dedic to what they havent finish what they have finish is downstair where underdog use to be you can still see remnant of how the bar use to look includ a dog statu but gone are the empti fireplac replac with long dine bench upfront akin to communal dine of wagamama and separ tabl up the back

it look good veri slick and chic the food is probabl where the star came down a littl i mean it a chain they have broth noodl a few small bit of sushi and even burger i imagin if the burger are good this is what ill come here for but the starter of salti and spici squid that i order was veri bad cook squid veri chewi overcook the fact that it came on a bed of stirfri veget was a nice unexpect touch and made it far more fill but there was hard ani squid and as i said it was far too overcook just veri veri bad squid

th california roll tast premad and prepackag there was a lot more rice to fill ratio also they werent what all other california roll are no avocado crab meat instead of crab stick they were perfect fine probabl akin to the tesco or ms prepackag sushi

th noodl bowl my dine companion had was smaller than wagamama which is good for those watch what they eat in januari it also look tasti the food is not bad at all per se it just given that i know where to get the tastiest sushi in edinburgh and have had far better squid from a chines deliveri the night befor both of what i had was disappointing

also the confus with upstair be open but not open and then the chef in the back shout servic whenev he had someth readi to go to a tabl rather than ding a bell left me feel it was far more style than substance

stil i can imagin it get busi and pleas a few hungri tum and those look for a trendi asianstyl place to dine or drink id go here for the locat and the ambienc insid rather than the food and do not jenni s this is direct main at you order the squid youll be sore disappointafter log in some time at the daylight day club we were hungri and look for a good place to get our grub on within mandalay bay a friend rememb have a good experi here so we figur it should be pretti good well it fell a littl short of the mark with pricey food and slow servic my tuna melt was good but it better damn well be for 16 the accompani season crisscut fri were a tad overdon make them over crunchi the servic was nice but slow it seem like it took forev for the food to come out and we were hungri it was crowd to be sure with 4th of juli weekend and the mma fight and all but it seem like they shouldv anticip this and staf appropri not a special destin in my bookcough cough cough  i think i now have emphysema from inhal all the smoke from the casino while eat at fat choy  whi did they pick eureka casino  dumpi old hotel with veri poor ventil  

about the foodw got 2 order of pork belli bao sinc the duck bao was not avail today boo bone marrow and shrimp toast

pork belli bao
for 7 you get 2 piec of bao  the pork was crunchi but super salti hello hypertens  they couldv ad more sauc to neutral the salti 355

shrimp toast
8 get you a piec of toast with shrimp chines sausag and a fri egg on top  it was good  but not 8 good you can get shrimp toast at most chines restaur for half the price  35

bone marrow
8 of fatti good with good onion jam on top  55

i usual dont pay attent to the price when it come to food  but today i had to  i think fat choy is overr and overpr for what i get and where im get it from  i can understand pay 8 for shrimp toast if i were in bellagio or wynn  i can get 3 piec of bao from somewher els for the same price  the concept is great but need to be improv befor i can come back again  mayb next time ill just order food togooh wait they charg 1 for that

it look like the next review ill be do is for a hospitthis restaur deserv a solid 35 rate in my book there is a lot to like about this place for exampl the food is fresh the portion are substanti and the price are reason 

there are sever lunch special to choos from that includ your choic of wonton hot  sour or egg drop soup i opt for the chicken and string bean special  with hot  sour soup their version of hot  sour soup was outstand it was perfect for a cold day and was just spici enough although the chicken use in my dish was not the best qualiti the green bean were cook perfect onc i ask for chili oil my lunch was complet 

mi wife opt for the cashew chicken and was margin satisfi she wasnt exact thrill about the fatti chicken use in the dish my smaller kid split the chicken and broccoli dish and seem to enjoy it

th servic is actual pretti good for a takeout chines restaur  our drink were refil in a time manner and our dish were clear immedi for a parti of 5 our bill was about 2800 not includ tip 

i dont know if i would choos this place over my favorit chines restaur in town howev this doe make a great place to stop if you want a quick lunch that is actual pretti goodthis review is base on my takeout order  i came here to order just won ton soup but after check out the menu i couldnt resist the great deal they had for the famili dinner it a good valu for what you get 
 
choic of 3 soup won ton hotsour and egg drop got the won ton  the dumpl was pretti meati and wrap textur was al dent chewi bite to it i like it cook more and softer  the broth was full of flavor steami hot sprinkl with bit of chop green onion and sliver of char siu pork for me it was pretti basic and just a tad salti though  mr b say i have hypersensit tast bud and he thought this was the best won ton soup by far 

3 differ appet are also includ egg roll crab rangoon and fri shrimp egg roll had a crunchi outer layer but wrapper insid was a littl chewi fill of veggi and pork was pretti good but a littl greasi crab rangoon had alot of fill and fri shrimp was okaymor batter than shrimp 

entre  choic of two got the pork egg foo yung and sweet and sour pork efi came with 3 huge thick patti and separ contain full of brown gravi cook perfect this was my favorit dish also the ss pork did not disappoint  it the western version where pork is coat in batter and deep fri nice chunk of bite size juici pork but batter was on the thicker side  ss sauc is like everi other place i like the sauc and pork were pack separ for take out 

big plus for me is choic of brown rice in this meal or you can have pork fri rice or steam rice

din area is small  but plenti of seat layout of tabl and chair are design to fit at least 7 tabl of 4  there is also a larg screen tv artwork on the wall and pretti water featur and bamboo plant as part of the decor the kitchen in the back look pretti snazzi and clean as well 

servic wascurt employe at counter took my order which at first was misunderstood said i order some dish as my first entre but i never told employe my first choic no apolog for mistak no welcom no small talk even when i tri to initi it  pretti much straightforward till i got my order was when employe manag to crack a smile and say thank you  
 
so overal 35ish counter servic could use littl more improv food is pretti good it hit the spot when crave chines food i appreci the choic and menu select the price they charg are veri reason and serv were more than enoughim with mike and debra on this oneit start out good and end up aok

y they have a wide varieti of thing yes it clean and spacious and their condiment bar is pretti cool etc but when we arriv here on a friday night i was expect tabl to be pack sinc there are mani high rate review we had an empti dine room with onli one other table

w enter through the back and the ladi were pretti nice and help and we order an elotecorn on the cob from her the order system is similar to gordos
so it not difficult navig your way down the line while the ladi were nice no servic with a smile from the guy and we kept repeat our order at lest 34 time becaus the music was too loud and they had a hard time rememb what we order we order some nopalescactus and three tacos pastor tripa and cabeza

w like the corn and the cactus was pretti good with the bean but the taco were okay the cabeza was pretti bland i alway request tripa extra crispi but this was still chewi on the insid the best of the three was the al pastor good flavor but pretti skimpi on the meat glad i tri this place though it okay but you have a much better option just up a few block from herealoha

yelp 100 challeng 201396100 new taco joint in townwhat a nice new find hey it is a fast food type establish but it tast pretti good and it was on the for real cheap you can dine insid or they have a drivethru 

the menu board is easi to read they have your basic option like taco burrito quesadilla nacho etc i order the hard taco platter it was suppos to be 399 but i onli got charg 139 score i alreadi thought the origin price was cheap this came with 2 taco bean and rice for the taco i order the ground beef and the shred beef the ground beef had no flavor the shred beef on the other hand was real tasti the crunchi taco shell were good but generic the rice was okay and the bean were good my hubbi had the footlong shred beef burrito this onli cost 499 and ad anyth els is 1 again the shred beef was tasti the burrito was doubl wrap with 1 huge tortilla for the price and tast you cant go wrong 

the servic was good they have fresh side of salsa free with purchas tri it just dont expect authent mexican foodim not gonna lie i mean this place wasnt half bad but there definit some room need for improv ill give it a few month and itll be an amaz restaur but anywho i went to the new temp locat it super nice at least from the outsid and i love that there is a drivethru the waitress were realli nice and quick and our food came fast so that was awesom i had the halibut fish sandwich i mean it tast pretti averag veri similar to a wendi fish sandwich on the downsid it was realli messi way to much mayo and tartar sauc i liter couldnt wipe it off with a napkin but the fri and onion ring were awesom and my boyfriend love the italian beef sandwich with sweet pepper and the bread chicken on croissant this place is realli cool i will just give it some time to get itself establish after all the hype about portillo come to temp marketplac and the photo friend had post on yelp i was look forward to tri this place 

ive never been to chicago but ive had a delici chicago style hot dog befor i figur portillo had to serv up a hot dog better than the one i had from a food truck in phoenix honest the one i tri tonight from portillo was not ani better on a posit note the beef hot dog with everyth 265 had good flavor with all the fix mustard relish fresh chop onion slice red tomato kosher pickl spear and sport pepper my primari complaint was that the perfect steam poppi seed bun was pretti soggi from all the fix by the time i got home it seem that the hot dog might best be enjoy in the restaur as the bun doesnt stand up veri well  or mayb they should serv the fix on the side for custom take the hot dog togo 

the onion ring 219 were pip hot and crispi but lack much in the way of flavor  definit noth noteworthi 

the custom servic was excel the drive though servic seem like a soupedup version of the in  out experi a person take your order outsid instead of an intercom at the menu anoth person confirm your order and collect your payment also outsid by walk up to your vehicl final a third person grab my order from the window and brought it to my car this doesnt seem like the most effici system and unlik sustain dure the summer month but it a nice attempt to make the experi more welcom and customerfocus 

overal good not great experi tonight i will return to tri other offer and reevalu thank to a fellow yelper shoutout to irina i was surpris to learn that they actual have vegetarian and pescatarian sandwich which have receiv posit review next time mayb ill have to tri the grill tuna sandwich or the halibut sandwichconveni locat near starbuck i can do bfast and pick up a dozen bagel pre packag pick my cream chees and be on the road in just a few minutes

th staff is help and they have the servic down to a scienc here i cant say how the bagel are sinc i didnt indulg this time but im sure they were as good   consist like their other locations

il use this locat again for the convienthis is quicktrip a massiv servic station and conveni store consid the popul of temp it has about 20 lane on either side of 10 pump station 

it is on scottsdal road near the border to the citi of scottsdal one of the 3 main street of scottsdal there are a lot of street in scottsdal but you onli need to know scottsdal hayden and the loop 101 and you can get to everyth els actual this is also near the 202 

scottsdal is what temp want to be when it grow up temp home to arizona state is kind of like a teenag room messi unkept hangout for the young and immatur and where all the beauti babe can be seen but not had  

the farther north you go from temp to scottsdal it is like a person passag into midlif their are apart complex then home and children and larger home with all the possess you would want and final retir home 

the messi room turn into well organ live space with manicur landscap the peopl  becom older and frequent the whole food look for vitamin and fiber more than the conveni store for a soda and snacks

thi is quicktrip number 00429 regist 2 approv code 306709 
good luck on your passagthis is a fun famili own restaur to go to when you are crave some delici scandinavian food with a canadian twist been to their older restaur sever time befor and this newer locat is both nicer and quit a bit larger

cam to the new locat for my son in law birthday lunch he love this place and so doe my wife and daughter my wife is of swedish descent and a big fan of this type of cuisin and noth too spici trust me there is noth spici here

servic was veri friend and most help when it came time to order start off with some gravlax for an appet and a tasti beet salad that we all share they were both realli good and got us in the mood for more hungry

ord the elk stew which sound realli good there was veri littl elk meat on the dish and it seem to be most mash potato with a mushroom gravi and some small side my wife went with the swedish meatbal with some veggi and more mash potato there was onli 6 meatbal and they were veri small it was hard for her to share ani of them with the rest of the party

daught order a cardamom chicken dish with veggi and mash potato the sauc was pretti good and had some nice flavor birthday boy order a pork belli dish off the special menu it look realli tasti and had a fri egg on top of it and all of that on top of  wait for it  more potato my 15 month old granddaught probabl enjoy the food the most she was unabl to resist catapult small piec of beet with it purpl juic across the room and onto the floor ha

they definit have the flavor down here and a veri nice menu would like to see more protein on the plate and the cost of the dish reduc down to a reason amount fifteen to twenti buck per plate for lunch portion is a littl steep in my opinion mayb it was just too much potato per squar inch

giv them a tri and see what you think it could be that they bit off more than they can chew with this new locat the rent here is probabl doubl or tripl from what they were pay at the last place sometim keep it simpl is the best way to go now onli if they actual sever  beaver

35 starlet me prefac that there is no doubt in my mind this place will be a four or five star review they just need to work out a few thing 
the greatness
beauti interior actual look like a high end gastropub
loc beer on tap galore
friend staff everywher we saw
foodi food at pv mall finally

th three stars
no kid menu that will not fli  i am a restautu and a foodi and a father of two you are not tell me you do not want kid here you are tell me that you do not want famili here and let me assur you that there are 100s of foodi famili like myself i just dont want to spring 16 buck for a lamb burger for my nine year old on a monday night

i want my rare roastbeef sandwich with the horeradish sauc on the side and the kitchen would not accomod my request that is snobbi pretenti and not know your clientel pleas sow do not take yourself that serious you still are in a wal mart park lot i am veri acut to my palat and my disdan for certain ingredi so it is kind of presumptu when a restaur tell me about the integrid of the dish bs 

this place could be awesom they just need to come to term with their locat audienc and their food  fit in the phoenix market i will be backok i am a huge fan of the other white meat and this place is all about it  or so they say so i realli want to like the pork here   well i can say after tri it it was ok  i never plan on visit again so i cant say the dish are make me want to visit
y i tri the lamb burger and ugh wish i could say it was excel but i would rate is as good  
i like the local beer offer even a replica of blue moon but as note with my dinner guest wish i had a real blue moon to go with my pork  it is not the same it is a replica and the differ in flavor is notic  
candi pork was ok not someth i would order again  no starch on the plate with it so make sure you order someth els  
great bar great atmospher but the food is what attract me and it was not top notch like i had hopea solid throw back burger with some 21st centuri i give more of a damn about the qualiti of the product i eat adjust  sit back and think about the origin of this great concepti say sit back becaus that is what youll be do wait at the drivethrough

on quick suggest the standard is probabl too much for most of us  take off a patti and sell it as a sub standard or somethingwel mayb come up with a better name first

on more quick suggest avoid the drivethru ive had root canal that have taken longer then it take to get through this thing  they get ding a star until they can figur this outyou knowim realli not sure what to realli rate green and protein i like it it differentbut then againim not too big of a fan mayb i need to go here more than oncebut with the pricesmayb not 

anywaysmi boyfriend and i want to start eat healthier were not health freak but we dont want to becom obes one day either he heard about this place through his co worker the thought of make your own meal intrigu him so we were will to give it a tri we walk in know their price were on the higher end side

w both decid to get the make your own meal plate to sum it up portion are small it was actual perfect for me becaus i get full easili anyway but for all you big eatersb warn this may not fill you up yes it is a healthi restaur afteral yes the whole point in small portion is becaus it is healthi for you but im just saying
 it may fill me up but person it still left someth for me to desire

w also got two drink he got that green drink sorri forgot the name of it but ive seen a lot of yelper get it and i got the berri antioxid smoothi they tast differentbut a good differ manaft drink this it put jamba juic and tropic smoothi to shame green and protein smoothi drink tast natur and healthi you can tell it has natur ingredi and fresh fruit and veggiesunlik all the other sugar and crap that mayb be in jamba and tropical

so whi 3 star and not a higher rate 
2 star for the price it serious pay to be healthi  i think with 2 drink and 2 meal ran our bill to 30 for that price we could have went to cheesecak factori lol 

will we be back ehhmaybgo from best to worst

5 stars

th servic was excel  our italian waiter name loan was total on point from start to finish  the tablesid caesar salad which origin from mexico and has noth to do with itali he made was a marvel  he made the dress from scratch right in front of us start with the egg yolk spice anchovi and everyth els after  it was so cool to watch  he certain wasnt modest about his tablesid caesar skill either say he made it the best and it deliv  this is a must order and for 9 a person is a better deal than the other salad on the menu  

4 stars

i am a sucker for handmad pasta but we thought order a full entre plate of that would be insan too much food so we begrudg went with the lobster black truffl bake ziti  this was suppos to be a side dish but it was a huge portion easili for 4 peopl and it was so good  they definit didnt skimp on the lobster meat and it made for great leftov the next day  

nutfish zs great review twist my arm into order the andiamo grand meatbal  just what i need right  a meat appet follow by an entre of more meat  the meatbal was a littl smaller than the size of a softbal and was a handmad blend of veal pork and beef   it was a littl more on the solid side and the sauc with the ricotta chees top realli was a great blend of flavor  nice meatbal  this is not to be mistaken for their side dish of meatbal which is onli beef and pork   

3 stars

w got a side order of the oliv oil grill asparagus with cipollini onion which was a nice size portion compar to most other steakhous  the sauc on top was good and i like cipollini onion on pretti much anyth includ fruiti pebbl  

2 stars

our waiter gave us 2 surpris plate of spaghetti top with a kind of tomato cream sauc courtesi of the chef right befor our entre came out  it was total unnecessari filler consid we alreadi order a pasta dish and i didnt think it was veri good  i saw ron ss photo afterward with his caption ask if the sauc came from a can  i thought the same thing  my wife like it better than i did  i know i sound like a putz complain about free food but this wasnt need at all and i would just set this asid ifwhen they give it to you befor the entre come out  

1 star

it pain me to even write this but it was the goddamn steak itself  i got the bone in ribey had plan to go for the tomahawk after teri ws great review but they have sinc up the price from 65 to 79 and my wife got the filet mignon 
 
i take my first bite and shake my head kinda like huh  i take anoth bite get more perplex and then i take a final bite from a differ section turn to my wife and say this is not good at all  the ribey was lukewarm at best dri and wasnt even up to par with the 13 flat iron steak i had at herb and rye a few day befor that  

mi wife filet mignon was goodif you want it to tast like ahi tuna  she was surpris ok with it though so who was i to argu  loan come back ask how thing are and i tell him my problem with the ribey  it was as if this qualiti of steak should have been save for fool that order well done  it also seem like the steak had been sit in the kitchen for a while base on the temperatur  loan seem stun by this as was i  ive had plenti of ribey and this was the first time ive ever sent one back  ive onli thought about do it one other time n9ne but didnt pull the trigger  i wouldv sent back my wife filet had i order that as well  

i got the porterhous instead which was mile and mile better  it was juici and beefi where it was suppos to be and the temperatur was to my satisfact  that was 35 star  

so in the end i would still come back here for the italian fare caesar salad ambianc and servic but you might want to stick with vic and anthoni a coupl of casino over if your look for great steaki was here with other yelper for my go away thing befor i went to chinakorea im a fan of yogurt soju this place has differ flavor of sojuand no karaok yay

cool vibe tabl are lit up and chang color servic was alright

w tri a few thing on the menu like the sausag pork cutlet and bulgogi for drink we had mango yogurt and strawberri sojuit was happi hour when we went so drink were halfpric they also have drink other than soju

th food is pretti aw how can you screw up sausageand bulgogiand this is a korean bar the pork cutlet with chees was pretti good

so come here just for drink and forget about the foodmet up with some yelp friend here for a uuy get togeth as soon as i walk in bam the bar is right in front of you so this guy walk into a bar 

anyway the whole place is pretti spacious the bar itself is right in the center of the whole thing surround by tabl and chair the tabl are lit up someth you have to see for yourself on half the wall you have sever projector screen with projector show noth but kpop video i swear everi video had the same group of girl onli with differ hair and cloth dont get me wrong all these kpop girl are pretti they all just look alik sometim the dude look like the girl too

so i join my friend they are alreadi toast for like the umpteenth time the main reason whi they came here was for happi hour which was 6 pm 10 pm all drink 30 percent off that everyth from your differ flavor sojus to mix drink not a bad deal some of the food they serv is decent like chicken katsu with chees it kind of like what you would get if you had chicken parmesan but in a korean version

th onli thing that realli irk me is that you can smoke anywher you sit in the place i can imagin on a realli busi night your chanc of gettin lung cancer an emphysema skyrocket by a thousand percent 

i had a lot of fun hang out that night there wasnt too mani peopl there so the smoke was minim still i wouldnt wanna go here just becaus i want a drink for 30 percent off if onli somebodi could invent some kind of ventil system that suck all the smoke out then i can truli enjoy my experi if you smoke than by all mean keep suck on those cancer stickhidden in a busi park lot kind of hard to see if your on sahara crusin by 

upon enter it is veri dim bare ani light besid the kpop music video play and the neon light tabl watch your step becaus when you first enter the floor isnt level so girl who have heel on tri not to fall 

we seat ourselv at a tabl becaus that the onli place that had ani kind of light to even look at the menu and even that was a struggl we decid to order strawberri  yogurt soju to start our night my favorit boy they were good all those 3 star are from how delici i thought the sojus were later on we decid to get the mango soju as well again pretti damn good 

for food i had gotten a groupon 15 worth of food for 30 we order bulgogi fri which i thought were realli good we also go the chicken wing they were on the sweeter side  i didnt realli care for them also my friend got the spici rice cake which i didnt realli like either lol ¯ツ¯ 

servic took forev for a waitress to come and even acknowledg us the place was noth but busi when we arriv onc we got her attent the servic start to pick up she came by and check up on us onc in a while 

what i hate about this place was there was smoke allow i know it half a bar but it also half a restaur there should be a design place for smoker if even that 

place has potenti not make plan for my next visit but wouldnt cross it out from my list just yetholi fri seafood batman  between the singapor calamari bang bang shrimp and fish and chip i think ive had my fill of fri food for a while  

we start with the singapor calamari and bang bang shrimp for appet  the calamari is generic with too much bread for my tast  it doe come with some fri pepper which was a nice treat  the bang bang shrimp is their most popular appet and consist of crunchi bread shrimp in a veri mild sauc  both the calamari and shrimp were suppos to have a spici sauc but on a scale of 110 they were both probabl a 05  a posit is that the portion size are veri generous if your not share it could be an entre for one

i opt for sir will fish and chip becaus the descript said it was tempura style and becaus the fish was tilapia instead of the usual cod  the fish itself was realli good nice and juici and again generous portion  sad the batter was less tempura style and more long john silver style a giant block of fri batter that encas a filet of fish  crunchi and thick it didnt do anyth for the fish

i dont think bonefish grill would ever be my first choic if im at town squar but i also wouldnt dismiss it if someon els want to tri it  base on the tilapia in the fish and chip id want to tri their grill fish entrehmmmm  i realli like bonefish and when i was there entertain client at their orlando florida restaur i was wish that they had one of these restaur in las vega  my dream came true and i am tri this place yesterday with the family

overal i have to give this a weak three star  here is the deal it is both good and bad i will go back again just that it was not what i expected

1  let go with the good stuff first

a ambianc  veri nice decor franchis restaur  good size bar with sport on veri friend staff and greeter veri efficient

b avail  i like the fact that i made a reserv 15 hour befor dinner and was abl to get a nice tabl by the window

c  servic  pretti darn good veri attent and veri will to please

d  menu  veri larg menu someth for everyon  from seafood appet hamburg salad fish chop and steak dessert veri cool  plenti of draft beer and a just right select of wine

2  now let go with the odd stuff next

a  ambianc  as the sun was set whi would they lower the light in the restaur and open up the window shade that was at our tabl  it brought in the oddest most unpleas light from the dusk that was not light but an eeri glow and feel it was also odd to have a motor shade go up while you were eat right next to it  i dont want dusti bit fli around while i am eating

b  food  we had salmon sear ahi tuna chilean sea bass atlant swordfish oscar steam broccoli steam asparagus and steam medley of veget  to me the sea bass was absolut wonder just okay it was small and i order the asparagus which cost 200 more  now i know that asparagus compar to broccoli and string bean is more expens but for 5 sprig of asparagus i would think 200 extra is a bit much  also the sea bass was okay but what got me was the size  i am think the size was either small or the plate was way too big  perhap the 5 sprig asparagus took up too littl room  the grill salmon was good i stole a tast from the kid but i am not sure if they were happi to see a glaze on the salmon i think it was a miso glaze but you know it should be on the menu  the ahi tuna was pretti darn good just that it look like a lot becaus it is present over rice so it look like a good portion 

c  overal i find the food was uninspir and not excit for me i would tri perhap the steak or hamburg next time  also some non seafood appet would be good for the kiddies

i will tri the place again just that i need some motiv for this place

gk say not bad if you are in the areawe ventur over here for lunch away from the strip it a nice midrang restaur the server was friend and veri effici which made the dine experi pleasant

i had the bang bang shrimp i was curious sinc it seem to be a thing at bonefish grill it was just ok i expect someth spici that would be fill with a burst of flavor it wasnt it was fri shrimp with a light creami sauc coat if your go to say someth is spici  it realli should be spici it wasnt bad but it wasnt heat either the tortilla on the soft taco were hard im not sure if it was becaus the tortilla were not fresh or if they were grill and left out too long the side of pesto couscous was good it was light and refreshing

on dine companion had the grill fish of the day lunch entre which was rock fish mango salsa was ad he got a side of asian slaw this dish was so good he didnt even share one bite he said it was realli good the other companion had the lili salmon lunch entre with fri i didnt tri this one either but at least he offer it was a beauti present on the plate except for the fries

for dessert we share the coconut pie keep in mind this isnt a cream pie in case your more familiar with that it was serv with whip cream on top it smell sugari and sweet onc i took a bit i was intrigu it had a familiar tast the consist and flavor was differ but it remind me of coconut butter mochi it realli seem like this dessert was inspir by one of my favorit treat yay this dessert will definit bring me back hereveri reason price for happi hour 

we order the tootsi roll philli roll chili chees roll salmon roll spici tuna and some edamam includ drink everyth came out to around 40ish not too shabbi right ok so of cours i alway have to tri the philli roll becaus that my favorit most place alway skimp on the cream chees or salmon but no problem here there were huge chunk of it in there for you to enjoy the chili chees roll was differ i like the sauc howev it doesnt come with much insid besid a jalapeno everyth els was mediocr for me 

for drink i order the asian sangria this was good but a bit sour my friend order the peartini i felt like this was realli bland i tri it and it had no flavor whatsoev howev 34 for a drink get what u pay for folk 

the servic was realli good we were alway acknowledg and help id come back for happi hour if i was in the areai realli did enjoy the bbq and kale salad the one time i dine here  it more the sweet sticki rib varieti 

bbq wise they are good  the bbq sauc and rib were tender but it not in the same leagu with the vega bbq pitmast who smoke their rib if you are want that  the side and salad offer here are differ and initi whi i came here in the first place i want kale salad so bbq wasnt the prioriti for me lol

nick the owner and his wife are cool peopl  his regist happen to be offlin that even couldnt take debit card so he was tell his custom to just come back whenev to pay for the meal whaat  that super trusting

th downsid though is tri to catch them when they are open  just look at my past gripe on my check in hour for dinner say theyr close at 10pm went one night just befor 9pm and it was close  they suppos start oper earlier for lunch recent saw a yelper check in earli afternoon tom and he verifi they were open  so i went around 2ish and they were just lock up and leav and wouldnt open again til 4  

so fast forward coupl month later i tri again today  the neon light on the window say theyr open and the hour of oper read 11309pm but the door was lock and nobodi was home that the last straw  im just glad now  i went to the bank and got cash went back and paid for my dinner that same night becaus who know now when ill make it back there again i cant toler with the inconsist of their hour of oper i have been want to tri sushi catcher for a few month now after read the mani review i was there last friday night dine with friend  there are few sushi place just within 35 mile  this place might be hard to spot sinc the sign onli say sushi not the actual name  it is a small place and locat in a strip mall  

i am take off a star due the extrem long wait on food  actual my friend were starv by the time the roll and kitchen prepar food item final came  they onli have one sushi guy roll sushi even on the weekend  we had to wait about 45 minut for food to arriv  i had order the vega and rainbow roll  these roll were part of their all day happi hour menu  tast was noth spectacular but not bad

at the end the owner did apolog for the long wait and gave us all a soy sauc bottl to take home but was inexcus for the long wait  hope they would consid hire more staff to help on the weekendfrank i dont get the hypeher whi after wait 10 minut for my rather simpl turkey sandwich i wonder what was realli revolutionari about their order systemno pun intend but i never wait that long at subway or jimmi john for an orderactu i would say that jimmi john win in the categori of speed

and then you would think that by write down the order yourself and pass it on to the cashier everyth would be perfect well actual they forgot one item in the sandwichno big deal and didnt ruin my day or anythingbut then what the point of the person paper bag and the sharpi and the do it yourselfand the sandwich is not cheap either 600 for what it is

qual of the sandwich  i would give it a cthere is noth that made that sandwich superior to other in term of qualiti of the bread and ingredients

despit just be open just a few daysi just dont get it their slogan besid their name mention superior sandwichesi cant say i was blown away or anythingi want to give them a tri to show my support and to break the subway habit a little

two thing that i feel that which wich need to work on are speed and staff friendli i imagin that on busier day it would take a lot longer to get your order so i guess i wont bitch too much for my 10 minut wait i know i can be a diva sometim but theyv onli been open 4 day so ill give them a littl slack okay you get to keep the person bag and use the sharpi to then doodl and wiggl to your heart content on the bag how you feel that day whether youv been cheat on your wife or commit ani other mortal sinsand then guess what  you get to hang your veri own sandwich bag on the wall yippi i wasnt feel veri gay that day so i opt not to join in the challenge

oh last but not least theyv got newspap for you anoth yippieto make up for the waitand there also a televis hmmm would you mind consid the addit of internet access and mayb a hot tub  i had no idea that agav the restaur that was in this space befor had close until my good gal pal invit me to dine here  what i like about agav was the cool decor and ambianc includ the huge wooden door the patio even the bathroom all these thing are intact with the chang in ownership  what also the same to me is that the food is just ok  what differ is that dos camino is a small chain with locat in new york atlant citi and ft lauderdal and the price seem to be more expens than agave

w had
tradit guacamole
crunchi veggi for dipping
do camino bocadito trio

w were serv complimentari chip with three differ kind of salsa  tomatillo wateri a red salsa had a slight kick and tasti and a spicier orang salsa cant rememb the ingredi but i didnt realli eat it  
gal pal had the guacamol and veggi as her meal and she like it just fine  i had the trio which consist of two chicken taquito top with some kind of cabbag slaw two plaintain empanada and two molot potosina corn masa turnov with roast red pepper spici chees and salsa  this trio was list on the menu as price at 1650 so i was expect six bigger piec of food when the platter was serv i was surpris at how small the serv were for that price  i like the chicken taquito after i nudg the cabbag slaw off didnt like the tast at allsour and i like the plaintain as well  i did not care for the molot and onli ate one hope it would get better it didnt  it was just kind of spici tasteless is that a word
when the bill came my trio was onli 825 so it must have been price for happi hour which is a good thing becaus that dish is not worth 1650  i do have to say that the servic was great and we sat on the patio enjoy the late afternoon sunset  i just wish the food match the environi love me some fajita so sinc it in the name of this place it should be good note that i said should be good i want to first point out that the servic here was great our waiter came back to see if we need anyth and even brought more then 1 bean dip and salsa for the tabl without us ask most of the time you get a tini cup to share with a group of peopl but these were decent size salsa and bean dip and request more was no charg i didnt care for the salsa and it was thin the bean dip was good and like by our tabl a cup of fideo soup was includ with the meal and it was realli good for dinner i had a 2 item combo chili relleno chees enchilada and of cours rice and bean the bean were good becaus it was probabl the same bean dip we were eat previous the rice was dri and nasti my plate was swim in red sauc and some of it was soggi the relleno wasnt great but i did enjoy the enchilada soggi and all this plate could have had less sauc so you could get more flavor from what was under it my wife and a friend had fajita and i end up eat a coupl the meat was tough and chewi and the veget werent even cook my wife is also in love with avocado and was not pleas with their guacamol at all mayb we came on an off night becaus this appear to be a popular place and the restaur had plenti of custom in it i just cant say i ate anyth that i would come back forafter come here a few time i think the best time to come here is dure happi hour which goe from 400pm  700pm daili  some of the highlights

import draft beer 350 for 16oz or 450 for 20oz
wel drink 350
margarita 350 for 12oz or 450 for 16oz
fajita quesadilla 695

come in dure happi hour and for around 20 or so you can have quesdilla free chip and salsabean and three drink  not bad at all

outsid of happi hour ive had their fajita beef chicken pork and shrimp  the fajita are decent but not necessarili someth to go out of your way for  the fajita for two combo is about 25 which realli can be enough for three peopl if you keep snack on the chip and dip  again not realli good enough to warrant go out of your way for especi sinc they close pretti earli  friday and saturday they close at 1000pm the rest of the week they close at 900 so unless your in the area youll want to be sure to come here earliim not entir sure how i feel about vic the restaur is nestl deep in the heart of anthem and could prove hard to find if you are not a sca resid it is in the club hous type build across the street from walgreen when we arriv it was eerili quiet outsid  my boyfriend said he felt as if he had just arriv to a scientolog compound i concurred

aft slight wander around insid of the build we found the restaur we were greet by a friend hostess and led to a tabl in the corner of the restaur with a beauti view of the citi our server was great he was attent and friend without be overbear i order a glass of red wine and they serv us a bread basket with three fair plain roll and plain ol butter i would take out the bread basket altogeth if unabl to either spice up the roll or the butter or perhap offer port wine chees in addit to the butter

a our appet we opt for the black and blue slider 10 they were two slider with beef tenderloin bleu chees onion arugula tomato and garlic aioli the tast was fine but the meat was pretti tough i wouldnt order these again

th entre price are reason for the amount and qualiti of food the entre rang from 16 veggi lasagna all the way to 38 rack of lamb i was in a mood for a salad so i select the warm spinach salad 11 boyfriend went with the salmon 22 the salad was fine and veri rich the portion did justifi the price i felt the vinaigrett was a littl overpow the salmon was pretti straight forward it was a generous portion and it was cook just right 

the food was fine but as a non sca resid i wouldnt rush back here i would have prefer to see a smaller more refin menu and bigger tast the item were just aoknorth mountain has terrif potenti as a great neighborhood spotwher everyon will know your name  base on the soft open most thing are on track  our server was attent and knowledgeablealway a good sign for some place just open  we share mussel and they were terrif just need to come out a tad bit warmer  i had the fish and chipsth fish was realli goodcrispi but not greasi and flaki but not dri  i am not a big beer drinkerbut the pale ale was  flavorfulperfect for someon like me who want to enjoy a beer without be  overwhelm  by it  so whi the three star  for a brew copubth fri food have got be a step abov  although the fish was terrificth chip left a great deal to be desir  i ask for mine well done and crispythey came out one tint away from  off white and were limp and soft  not the way fri should be  they were also over salti come out of the kitchen  fri should have a tast of their own but still have room for an individu own salt and bath in ketchup is you so desir  

i am sure i will return to tri more  both beer and food  i do hope they will fix the fri thoughmy visit to north mountain brew co was good  aok is the perfect description

our group of 3 enjoy share a varieti of item in between the marathon of talk and laughing

pretzel bread  in my world all pretzel bread need to be serv with chees  as much chees as possibl  i get it not everyon love chees as much as i do but to charg an addit 1 for the smallest ramekin of chees ever is kind of disappoint  

poutin  my first time ever have poutin so i dont have a basi of comparison  it did seem to have way more gravi than short rib meat and chees  more chees please

mussel  favorit thing we tri  a nice portion with sourdough bread to dip in the savori white wine butter sauce

piec of cake  cute littl dessert top with vanilla bean ice cream

north mountain malt  i could have happili taken this all for myself but was practic my polit skills

i would definit go back but would smuggl in my own chees ssssshhh had to come to hi fi and tri one of these adult milkshak i kept hear about  i opt for one with  pineappl and coconut   i was not blown away they were pretti good just not veri strong at all  we order some hummus some wing and a coupl other appet  the food was decent onc again noth that blew me away  i did realli like the look of this place cool for day drink and nighttim drink alik best view for peopl watch  i would also say that i found it to be more of an earli 20s crowd when i was therea coupl week ago some friend employe of jimmi john stop by our offic hand out free sampl which was a great idea sinc we didnt even know they were open i feel like their sandwich tast differ from subway or quizno i think it becaus of the bread i realli like the bread at jimmi john haha it not too thick or loafi and it got a nice chewbit to it i especi like the tuna sandwich here with lot of those sprout on top the doctor i work with order deliveri from jj and it onli took about 15 minut super fast and the deliveri guy drove an audi awesom 

hot tip watch what you eat they do all their subsclub san bread wrap in lettuc mmmoh how the mighti can fall

th chola was the newest open in edinburgh i was most excit about it open in march and i went about 6 time in 4 week as my first review of it attest i got chat to the waiter and learn that the chef was from south india and had been a south indian chef for a number of years

th food that was present over the last 6 month at the chola was beauti chana masala chock full of chickpea chicken curri so delic and intric spice paratha bread that was melt in the mouth delici dosa that were crispi and fill with flavou potato or lamb

but in the last 3 month the food qualiti has reduc quit a lot and in such way that i can point out what has chang the chana masala has about 12 has mani chickpea as it use to and is far more a sauc with some float chickpea in it befor it use to be made up of almost pure stew soft chickpea the dosa onc came home deliveri with a lamb fill that had no flavour or spice they must have forgotten to add ani spice but it was tasteless the chicken curri tast like standard uk indian creami spici curri but with no distinct flavour the paratha is thicker heavier less butteri and fresh and just not as great the aubergin curri also has less aubergin in it 

this use to be a restaur that offer what mani indian restaur in edinburgh couldnt excel indian food authent cook and spice with beauti ingredi good portion size with veri uniqu dish the wait time in the restaur was lengthi and the interior of the restaur is also veri lack and plain but it was worth it for the delici food

now the restaur is still lack in decor the wait time is still veri long and the food qualiti has reduc so much that i dont want to spend 30 minut wait for it and realli dont know if ill go back ive order both sit in and takeaway 5 time from them sinc i notic the chang in qualiti each time hope the last was a fluke but no it seem to be permanent

thi is almost like a break up im sorri chola you still serv total aok south indian food but it certain isnt ani differ or special to anyth els serv in edinburgh and you use to have someth that no one could imit such a shameyou would think that ani restaur that has the word pizza in it name would make a great pie right that not the case here it was averag at best and i can think of at least five place off the top of my head that make a better one 

pizza come in three differ size person 14 and 18 my kid and i tri a classic chees pizza and a chicken pesto pizza the person size is a narrow and elong flatbread shape the chees pizza wasnt bad but the crust was just too thick the chicken pesto had the same type of crust and was surpris bland consid all the top on it

w also tri the gorgonzola and fig flatbread appet the delic and crispi crust was similar to a cracker crust top with plenti of gorgonzola and fig it made for a delici app that was plenti big to share

th flourless chocol cake end our meal the dens cake had a raspberri spread between the cake and the icingtop it was anoth dish meant to be share as it rich was too much for me to finish on my own

theyv got plenti of item on their menu so im sure ill be back to tri some but chanc are ill skip the pizzagreat tast halfcaf  but the servic was a bit slow for me  i dont normal come to an airport with a lot of time to spare so pull up to the starbuck and get my coffe in less than 5 minut would be appreci  nevertheless i had time to spare so the long line and wait wasnt much of a problem this time  i think that perhap they were caught off guard by the crowd on this day  

one thing ive notic is that starbuck franchis servic is not as good as the servic one receiv in the starbuck store that are own by starbuck  oh well grab your coffe and drink up then pull up your laptop and charg upwrite a 3 star review is the hardest thing to do folk you have to justifi how someth isnt terribl yet it not fantast either yet meh is not a suitabl explan for thing 

the short barrelhous is a great lowlight unpretenti place to grab a realli good cocktail and hang out with friend their beerwin select as well as craft cocktail are invent and delici that be said i wouldnt go out of my way to stay for dinner here is why

cocktails
i order a pomegran cocktail and a pumpkin king while my date got a fin du mond beer both my cocktail were fantast and veri origin they accommod my need less sugarnot as sweet and their list had ton of drink i was die to tri the list is long but it definit worth exploring

cheddar biscuits
thi is the tastiest thing at barrelhous it the equival of go to red lobster onli for their biscuit dont you snarl at me i know youv done it you get a differ varieti of bread everi time you come and this time we score big with the tasti flaki biscuits

salmon cake
ord as an appet we got 2 salmon cake with some pickl tomato and microgreen on top the cake fell apart instant as they didnt have enough binder they were also not crunchi or had a good crisp to it outer layer final the salmon was too fishi and had a veri strong tast would not order again

jerk spice sea bass
th sea bass was perfect cook and fell apart like butter howev the jerk rub place on top of the sea bass onli on top which is strang was incred strong and floral yes floral i love jerk season and didnt stop eat it when i went to jamaica but this season was way off i unfortun pull it off the sea bass and squeez some lime juic instead the fish was place on top of jasmin rice which i actual thought was mash potato becaus the rice was so over cook and mushi the rice itself was not season nor had flavor  neither did the green bean place in the middle

steak and fries
a simpl dish but pretti good it a giant fish featur a big piec of stake on top of herb fri the fri were tasti and the steak was perfect cook the onli problem with it was that the steak was kind of chewi sinc the done was fine the chewi might just be from the cut of meat they serv or mayb the qualiti not sure if you are not picki about your meat then this is a tasti dish that is guarante to fill you up

service
fin the servic at barellhous is top notch they are veri courteous super profession and focus on the custom i was veri happi with the staff here and think it is one of it best redeem qualitithe happi hour is from 26pm and the menu dedic for happi hour has one side drink under 6 and the other side appet sushi roll and pizzaaverag price is 5 i saw karag chicken salmon poke california roll includ in hh menu  i order the pork belli bao bun which were realli good the bun was soft the pork belli was a littl too crisp though 3 appet size came in a fanci platter unfortun my phone had low bat so no foodporn for this review
 
the menu i was given was primarili sushi and a few beefchicken bowl option i didnt see ani bento box as my choic come to find out later that is onli on the dinner menu  so i end up with eggplant fri and the beef teri as my entre sinc i dont realli care for sushiyeah i know blasphemy
 
the eggplant fri yay  the teriyaki bowl nay  i realli like these fri  veggi dip and fri in a light tempura batter and sprinkl with parmesan chees for sure i would order this again veri good  the teri bowl though not so much the slice beef piec i had was a littl dri and tough and the teriyaki sauc was too thick and salti for me

loc insid south point casino next to steak n shake you can either sit at the sushi bar or the tabl and booth surround it there is also anoth dine room but it was not be use at the time
  
servic staff is still lack in finess depart servic start out fine but after i got serv my entre i didnt see my server till i got my check grant he had to cover a lot of tabl in his area it was not that busi in my opinion  i need silverwar and couldnt get his attent at all so after a few minut went by i had get up and ask someon els i dont expect to be wait on hand and foot but a littl acknowledg can go a long way you know 

hope the kink will get work out caus i realli would like to come back and tri more item on that happi hour menu that lyche martini sound goodfood ive onli come here dure the happi hour and order from the hh menu ive been here a coupl of time now and was disappoint to see that their eggplant fri are no longer on the hh menu it remind me of portobello fri but more tender  although there wasnt much flavor to it the dip sauc compliment it well these were probabl my favorit on their hh food menu ive had the chili garlic edamam as well and i realli like the flavor here it was a good amount of season that realli fought out the flavor of the edamam we also had the ahi poke which was realli good but i felt i could have fresher fish elsewher i realli like the fact they have a number of sushi roll on their hh menu and what now look like some kind of pizza i probabl will tri one of these dure my next visit 

environmentambi the restaur itself is tuck in a small corner of the casino and is a bit small with booth line the wall and a larg sushi bar in the middl it a veri open area that connect to the casino floor it look as though they may get a bit busi dure their happi hour so sometim there a bit of a wait

servic dure my first visit i dont rememb our server be neglig dure our second visit our server was attentiveat first but when she notic that we were just order drink we had alreadi eaten and were plan on eat later we saw her less and less she onli check on us onc and that was just to see if we want a refil on our drink it came to the point where i honest thought she had forgotten she was our server as she walk by us a number of time without even a glanc our way we were on a time crunch and we couldnt even flag her down to ask for the check

tip they have great deal for the happi hour which is everi day from 2pm6pm but come earli as it can get a bit busithe burger sound so good on the menu but are onli execut at an ok  good level

i bought a groupon here when they still had a 4 star rate on yelp  i am with the yelper sinc that have lower the score  even for the groupon price the meal was a littl underwhelmingif i had paid full priceyik 2 or 25 star at best  i settl on three here sinc i use the groupon and just saw anoth round of groupons

when i order a burger from a selfacclaim gourmet burger establish they need to nail the cook tempmeadiumrar is not the same thing as medium  simpli put get it right  i order the posh kobe burger  the burger come with foie gras and a pair of fri quail egg  these are nice top and done well  the patti itself though was less than averag as ani kind of grassf kobe patti goes

i also tri the venison burger  this burger was not except balanc with it top and as a result was on the sweet side  i like the idea of a cranberri relish bearnais sauc and roast red pepper with venisona littl sweet play wonder  it was just too sweet and wasnt  in harmony

th crush potato are a solid side with great flavor though perhap not technic crush potato  that be said one of the best thing i ate here was the caesar salad  they do a great homemad caesar dress here  it was appli a littl too generous for my like howev  we finish our meal off with the some pistachio ice cream atop a bitterchocol cake  the ice cream was tasti and the cake was fine but noth im run back for

th bottom line is that there are better burger in town at the same priceand the execut at posh burger bistro is a littl off on top of that

if i came back i would tri the wild boar burgernice clean restaur with a realli cool concept insid is decor with tabl that look like surf board and big screen tvs on the wall show peopl surf on hawaii fiveo waves

fish burger fish taco fish and chip salad soup appet and more they even have a kid menu with the kinda stuff children enjoy must be under 10 year old the menu state i wonder if they check ids

th wife and i both order their famous fish taco which they claim are rate 1 in the usa i was hope you could choos the type of fish they put on them but they come onli one way they load it up with 17 differ ingredi which may be part of the problem

on top of it be too big to put in your mouth the flavor of all the top seem to overpow the fish both of us agre it was miss someth and fell flat not more top the size of the piec of fish also appear to be rather small and the textur tast like the the fish may have been previous frozen onli saw the word fresh on the menu when they were talk about their bake bun hmmm

24 buck for 4 taco and we were both still hungri ill drive to san diego for that and then some would like to see some better napkin that do not fall apart as well cha chinganoth ramen hous in vega and im sorri to say i wasnt too impress with the ramen  i didnt have ramen as my main meal but tri some of terri rs  mayb i dont know what a good bowl of ramen is  mayb im just too loyal to sora and monta  but one thing that disappoint me about korakus ramen is that it was lack that silki and creami tast  actual it was lack flavor all togeth this is just my opinion  other peopl may like ramen with almost no tast  but all wasnt lost on my visit here  my main meal was their ground beef steak and a side of their mini menchi katsu  i felt both were pretti good  

ground beef steak  this was serv with hayashi sauc this was pretti much a loco moco minus the egg but you can get egg with this  the sauc was made the way it suppos to be ie thick somewhat tangi and all over the place im not huge fan of this and end up brush a lot of the sauc to the side other than that i thought my meal was fill and flavor  this had more of a salisburi steak tast to it than a ground beef tast in my opinion 

mini menchi katsu  this was basic two mini hamburg patti that bread and deep fri  think of the textur and initi tast of a chicken katsu but with a ground beef tast to  wasnt bad at all just bad for you  

the restaur wasnt too busi and the servic was great  we had a lot of food but again i wasnt too impress with their ramen  but i could still see myself come back for the other food on their menuso let cut down to the chase 

lunch is 999 for a singl trip all you can eat is 1399 for dinner the all you can eat price is the onli option kid 10 and under lunch is 599 and 899 for all you can eat respect dinner start at 4 pm

they give you a medium size bowl to put all your meat veggi and sauc in if you are do the singl trip cram as much as you can into the bowl so you can get your money worth 

you hand it over to the cook they will ask you if you want it with steam or brown rice i recommend the brown sinc it healthier for you sinc the meat are frozen but thin slice they dont take long to cook you can actual stand there and watch them cook it and hand your plate to you after they are done cook the onli advic to you here is that to make sure they cook it well becaus undercook pork chicken and turkey can realli make you sick

when you bring it to your tabl you have sriracha and sweet chili sauc readi to go in contain just in case you need more spici or sweet kick to your grill goodi fountain drink are 249 with free refil i ask for water note their water is straight tap it not filtered

servic is decent for they realli dont have to do much except get you your drink refil and your check their locat is in an ideal spot for they are right next to the hard rock casino hotel 

overal i like the fact that the onli time you realli have to wait is when they cook your food which is a major plus i recommend you get the all you can eat and definit have enough time to enjoy it becaus it is kind of pricey it not the best but definit better than genghi grill over in hendersonlunch yesterday was a stop at taco tijuana  the servic is great  the chef offer eric r a sampl of the adobada  he explain what everyth was  eric r order a mula with flour tortilla and suadero and a cabeza taco  the mula is like a tortilla sandwich with chees and meat so a deconstruct quesadilla of sort and come with choic or corn or flour tortillas

i order a lengua taco and a lengua sope  the sope is like a corn cake that is stuf with the meat and here top with a crispi corn chip  the chef insist we take an adobado taco con pina on the hous which was veri nice but he did that onli after i told him i do not eat pork  eric r ate it

ther are radish and lime but no salsa bar  the lengua was delici  i have a hard time dislik ani lengua taco in general and this was veri tasti  the sope was great too  for me it was a forkandknif situat becaus it was veri thick but too wide to lift up and bite  eric r enjoy his cabeza tast like suadero he said and his mula  he was so full but ate the adobada too

w were onli there for like 15 minut but we smell like burnt meat the rest of the day  it was in my hair and my cloth and same with my hub  it was like we went to a local casino and smell like smoke in a way  becaus of this afflict and the lack of a salsa bar i knock off a star  good food and great servic so enjoysome roberto can be good some are not this locat is just okay it fair clean and realli doesnt have a ton of peopl come into this locat roberto is alway open 24 hour for peopl who need some serious heavi drunk food

ambi 3  fast food shop style small kitchen with a good amount of chairs

servic 4  the peopl were okay they got our order done quick they were nice and spoke spanish 

food 3  there a giant menu at roberto of fast food mexican not realli authent food if that what your look for

meh the food was just alright ive had better roberto from anoth locat i felt that the carn asada was a littl dri and flavorless here mexican isnt realli my food of choic but man is it filling

howev if you do plan to eat here i suggest the breakfast burrito or the carn asada fri which are not that bad even with the meatgrand open for lulus bead and breakfast

think of this place as a pastri shopnot a full servic breakfast spot  

i came here expect pancak and egg with wait servicei was wrong lol  it is the order at the counter bring it to your tabl setup which is fine just know it when you come here

sinc they ran out of the stuf french toast and i didnt see ani egg or classic plate setup i order a sandwich  sorri forgot the name ill edit with name and pictur later but it was the one that had red pesto egg white etc  the sandwich was a larg portion at onli 6 and everyth was cook well  it tast veri healthi lolbut it was still pretti yummy

i also tri some of the cooki and the macaroon  the cooki were good but not great  the macaroon were veri sweet much more sweet than the french macaroon i am get use to but still good  the insid were almost like a jelli consist but overal enjoy  i think the macaroon were around 125e roughly

servic was friend and help  not sure if we were suppos to clear our own tabl or not but they sat dirti the whole time we were there  wasnt a big deal to me but just rememb it not full servic here  

i hit it with a 3 star  this will be a great place for pastri and fast fixesnot so much for actual breakfast crave  if you are come here strict for treat and snack id consid it a 4 star setup

i will be back to tri the stuf french toast that they ran out of today especi sinc they are around the cornerthey have amaz pastri here but i wasnt veri impress by the stuf french toast also what is with the loav of bread left out are those what we can pick from if we want some bread they are just out there by the line and anyon can sneez or finger them ew

anyway i realli like the croissant i got i had it with nutella xd it was flaki and light and veri tasti all of the bread and pastri look amaz and were reason price consid they are fresh made

i did not like the stuf french toast at all we got the appl and raisin it was bland and had way too much egg batter on it that most of it turn out to be mush 

i will come back to tri some other breakfast item sinc i realli do want to give this place more starso this place was highlyr so we went here after realiz that about 5 of the 5star review were from what seem to be fake account 13 review no profil pic although the servic was pretti good it better be sinc there was hard anybodi there the food wasnt 4 or 5star qualiti filipino run this place not that that realli matter 22person for ayce

the server told me they have sashimi uni and amaebi for dinner ayc good to know but ill probabl go somewher elshave you ever been to a place that you realli want to like it close to home great atmospher great ambianc ambiti menu and you hope this could be a new place to frequent but the food turn out to be not that goodborderlin bad that was bootlegg for me 

first 

mi friend and i order the nacho the pork belli sandwich and the wing half in the miso glaze and half in the peanut butter and jelli glaze everyth was over cook and i mean everyth the pork belli came out dri and the wing were almost ined becaus the miso was reduc to pure salti the pbj wing had no flavor at all the wing did seem fresh and were all drum which was nice 

i will say the nacho were pretti good ton of guac sharp cheddar and pork but the pork didnt realli shine in this dish 

to be fair it seem like all the food was almost there but not quit we told the waitress the wing were bad and the owner came out and said he tast the sauc and we were complet right apolog and took the wing off of our tab i couldnt ask for a better respons and becaus of him i will be will to tri bootlegg again after the kink get work outthe lobster bisqu and my chocol strawberri was the onli favorit part of my meal on my first visit here the thai sandwich was a nice attempt with the fresh veggi but instead of shred  meat it was more like a mushi textur from be over cook or too much marin and the meat was non exist  there was a nice thick slice of bread though which is too bad for me sinc im carb conscious and tri to limit my carb intak  

the salad was okay the server who made my salad put way too much won ton crunchi in it wish he pile more fruit  the salad as a whole was cold and crisp and that what count i dont know everyth was just okay  tast more generic like everi other chain restaur i visit late  the big appeal here is the price it realli reason  i got away pay under 10 for 12 sandwich salad drink and a strawberri not bad  ill be back caus there are other salad creation that sound good that i want to trihad to tri this hot lunch spot in the curs revolv door locat on eastern at first glanc the long line out the door could deter anyon who has onli an hour to spare for lunch but the good part is the line move veri fast as they have the system down it could seem a littl chaotic order but let them direct you and use your time in line wise to select your item fresh made to order food on demandim a fan
i recommend the pick 2 combo for 799 we order the lobster bisqu serv with asiago chees crouton asian bbq pull pork sandwich nut about berri salad and tomato basil soup with orzo 
the lobster bisqu was chunki with veget and surpris good but no lobster meat in sight the pull pork sandwich was delici crispi veget with sweet pull pork on a soft bun i would definit get it again the berri salad was fresh and lettuc was not wilt yay the tomato basil soup was sweet creami with a hint of spice that remind me of curry
i would have given 4 star but i got a littl sick after eat here not sure if it was the food or ice tea in ani event i like the concept and the extens menu select will be backoveral delici but not blown away 35 at least until the next time i tri more 

so all morn i was all excit about go to rollin smoke bbq for lunch and here pull up the wa da pho food truck outsid my window at work it was closer to walk to the food truck than my car i had both rollin smoke bbq and wa da pho bookmark for a while and want to tri both equal as bad as the other talk about a food cblock fblock  well sinc wa da pho usual isnt out there a regular food truck and occasion a good food truck is park there i had to go for some for lunch they have a da pho box lunch special  choos 2 of 5 item and a drink or a dessert and chip for about 9 i went off of the pictur on their food truck sinc everyth look good didnt read the food descript usual the best way for me to do thing 

the first item i chose was the da lobsta ballz httpwwwyelpcombizphotoswadapholasvegasselectggcqbqogku7bhmsjahgwgggcqbqogku7bhmsjahgwg i enjoy most of it  the outsid tast veri delici the insid howev was meh it tast exact like imit lobster which is what the menu exact said after i read it light fri imit lobster ball serv with da sauc spice with their special blend of season i did no care for the insid becaus it was mushi like when you use too much water when you cook a pot of rice and tri to salvag it i know some peopl who like this kind of mushi so mayb it suppos to be like this which is fine  

the second item was the pholici q slider httpwwwyelpcombizphotoswadapholasvegasselectggcqbqogku7bhmsjahgwgfpbiqco1l4jkjrqledeukg it tast like eat a pho in a slider with more it was a pretzel slider bun with bbq pho brisket papaya slaw cabbag cilantro and their wa sauc it was good again but i didnt realli enjoy the pho meat part mayb becaus i alway dump sriracha and hoisin into my pho id ask for more sauc next time or even some of that da sauc from da lobsta ballz the chip and cinnabao dessert were enjoyable

i sampl some of the pholici q nacho and they were veri good nice size but a littl small for the price  it was light fri wonton chip with pho q brisket wow they actual call it that haha cilantro green onion melt big eye swiss chees top off with a splash of da sauc enjoy them the most

im a fan of their organ and effort in make thing easi and stand out logo on food box and contain order number and receipt system friendli etc follow them on facebook and twitter to know where they atbefor you come here you the first thing you need to know is that their hour are 12 pm to 8 pm monday through saturday close sunday on the busi list it say they open at 11 am well imagin my dismay when i show up at 11 onli to say a coupl of curs word and leav hungri to look for anoth place to hit up for lunch suck when you have your mind made up for a chees steak fyi i end up go to full hous barbequ a filipino restaur just down the street

so this next time i show up exact at 12 to check this bookmark off

i get the foot long chees steak 899 with the chees whizprovolon mix along with grill onion standard you can add bell pepper 125 mushroom 100 pepperoni 100 extra meat 350and hot cherri pepper 50 cents

th sandwich was ok but if you want to add everyth that i mention you would be look at a sandwich that is over 16 dollar say whaaaaaaaaaat

servic was great the overal ambienc of the place was just ok with sever tabl and chair there are philli paraphernalia on the walls

overal i thought it was just an ok experi noth realli impress me but at the same time noth realli disappoint either

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 144 what the dilli with the 16 dollar phillii hadnt heard of wahoo befor we walk in here  someon later had mention it was a chain  that ok i still want to tri it

w didnt know how their restaur work as far as sit and order or order befor you sit   well you order befor you sit down and they bring it out to you   we decid to split the outer reef burrito and the nacho with cajun chicken   the burrito eh  it was ok but i wouldnt run back to have anoth one  i think i had better tast burrito from taco bell  bummer   the nacho were pretti good  the cajun chicken on top had a great flavor with their blend of melt chees   

the servic was good too the cashier was friend but didnt understand a few of my question  oh well  the waitstaff who brought out the food and clear the plate were great veri courteous and polit   

i just wish the food was memor    it was fine but i probabl wont hurri back to be a regular heremichael mina pub 1842 is in the heart of mgm grand district  a long hallway with an odd combin of high end restaur shop and a food court it took over for sea blue also own by mina the place was loud like night club loud and it attract the poolday club crowd so youll see plenti of drunk dude in tank tops

th menu is full of stuff youll be familiar with but there a twist with most if not all dish an ingredi or two that has been ad to those comfort dish to make them new and excit like peanut butter on a burger or popcorn on a lobster roll i couldnt pass up the peanut butter crunch burger 14 the combo was so odd that i had to tri it and you know what it work the peanut butter light coat the undersid of the top bun there isnt a lot of it but there no mistak the tast when you take a bite in combin with the crunchi salti chip and a perfect well season beef patti with a crispi char coat it make for a great array of flavor and textur that are unexpect yet pleas it may not be the best burger ive had but it was certain memorable

th other food was decent but a step down from the burger the jumbo lump crab cake 19 was tasti especi with the garlic basil dress the avocado kale caesar 14 was an unnecessarili larg portion that tast good after the first few bite but was so rich that we left the rest of it untouch they took what should have been a healthi and light dish and fatten it up needless we order a side of chicken 14 that my kid had for his dinner 

the one side dish we got was the mac and chees 9 it was as creami smokey and cheesi as we had hope but what ruin it for us was the broccoli im not a fan of broccoli in mac and chees and if they had bother to list that ingredi on the menu i probabl would not have order it 

we didnt stick around for dessert although those option all sound delici servic was spotti as can be expect from a newli open restaurant

theyv got a few tabl with their own beer tap custom can swipe their credit card and pour their own beer might be some of the best tabl around for drink and peopl watching

th menu has plenti of attract sound dish and im sure ill be back eventu but i know which dish i wont be order againi had my doubt about this new thai restaur after drive up see it empti insid at about 7pm monday and quick read the 4 review alreadi post while i sat in the car  in spite of my friend august warn i decid to bold go where few thus far have gone befor and yelp about it

th restaur open dine area is pretti big for the amount of tabl and chair insid  if the goal is to make it look roomi they have definit succeed in accomplish this goal

th menu is fair simpl and standard for a thai restaur and per the menu cover they are work on pictur to go with the menu options

bas on the sasi ls review i decid to tri the doo dee noodl which accord to one of my friend in bangkok is a beefpork noodl dish serv at a popular franchis in thailand  the server immedi ask what spici level i want and i told him to just make it normal whatev that is  it onli took a few minut for the kitchen to prepar it  portion was smallish and kind of remind me of noodl soup you order for breakfast from the street vendor in thailand when i was a toddler  but the combin heat from chili and pepper was enough to prevent me from finish everyth in the bowl plus i was drink a lot of water to cool my mouth down

next i order the pad see ew with beef  portion was normal  tast good  but i could onli finish half befor ask it to be box up so i could finish the rest at leisur while i am at home check email yelp youtub etc

overal i think it is a decent restaur that need a littl more effort in the decor depart  the food is good and come out of the kitchen veri quick  howev base on the photo and descript by other review you will have to order with care at least until they have pictur to go with the menu on some item as to not be disappoint by the item be serv not meet your expect or histor experience

servic  friend and attent never have to ask for refil with the water brought out extra napkin when he notic i might need more

food  aok  

decor  felt like it is a temporari popup restaur or that the work was not complet no tablecloth but the light was fair dim that i could not see the decor if they had ani  not a big deal for me but just note it

loc  greater chinatown area twain and decatur

pric  averag and on par with the competition

authent  the heat level is pretti authent  but i have been away from thailand for like 332 year and was never an expert on the cuisin to be abl so say how authent thai or american the food here is

25 grand open discount until mid june 2013  

the hostess look great httpswwwfacebookcomphotophpfbid163710623798442setpb16087147741569022075200001370451541type3theati stop here for dessert after eat panda express in the food court the employe were veri friend and gave a a bogo coupon for a futur visit the pretzel were just okay the first jalapeno pretzel i had was dri and hard so i went back and they agre and made me a fresh one the fresh one was veri good i also share some of my wife cinnamon pretzel stick and they were good i paid for some melt chees sauc and end up get rock hard chees in a peel top plastic cup i turn the cup upsid down and noth move after have to go back and have my pretzel remad i didnt want to then go back up about the chees this place is good with a coupon but pay full price isnt worth it sinc you dont know if it go to be super bomb are dri and hard i did get a sampl of some lemonad that wasnt badi am happi they open this locat which is close to my home so veri conveni for quick stops

i come here for their meat and produc and that is it becaus everyth els is price way higher than at your standard groceri store

they have a great panaderiabakeri with yummi mexican bake good and an eateri where you can sit and eat food such as taco burrito albondiga soup etc hot and fresh

thi is a fun store and i realli like their fresh pina and juic they make daily

i just load up last night for 13 buck and got all of my produce

5 lbs jalapeno for 1
6 lbs of yellow onion 1
2 lbs of nectarin for 1
2 lbs green bell pepper 1
8 avocado for 1

i also like their meat becaus i make a lot of taco burrito fajita etc and they have marin meat which have great flavor

meat and produc at this store is the way to go

th store staff will speak to you in spanish i thought that was odd but funni i speak a littl spanish so is ok for me howev will suck to communic if you dontgreat concept but in my opinion still a work in progress

you want to eat healthier you want option you juic at home but your not at home right now and you dont do mcdonald and mayb you want a burger  skinnyfat may be your best bet in las vega the greater challeng howev may be find their leas space theyr in a commerci center on the servic road dean martin dr just west of the 15 just north of the 215 i drove to the address but even in front of their entranc didnt realiz i had arriv the face of their space is flat and can be miss if your look for a multidimension entranc there are graphic but the face of their space face the freeway is flat sorta like the mr green drink i got on my way out of town from a busi trip i found myself crave a green juic so i walk in and saddl up to the counter the interior is veri rusticcontemporari i like it

i didnt order ani food although their menu did look interest i end up order the mr green cold press juic it a 950 20 ounc serv but be awar they have two cup sit abov the counter and i was ask if i want the larg or small what i didnt know is that the larg isnt the 950 serv that actual the smaller cup the larger cup will be about 250 more although the menu board doesnt have that info a glitch that bother me and my counter person didnt explain i got the smaller cup for 950 

btw there anoth healthi eat cafe in henderson call protein hous i went there the night befor and had a respect turkey burger protein style wrap in lettuc and a steam veggi bowl my pick of veggi the concept is great but in both space i felt that the order at the counter process could be improv in the specialti food retail busi well train high compet and person staff separ the true highvolum winner over the wannab and from friend who own specialti retail busi theyv share that their face out front make all the differ in their sale volum and overal success it the counter person that if well train can coach a client from just a beverag to entre or app plus a beverag just sayin is allfirst impress of skinnyfat was most of the food we order was hit or miss i came with some friend for lunch last weekend around 11 the place wasnt pack yet but it was get there we found a corner tabl and order at the counter onc our entir parti had arriv 

i opt for the cranburkey with a side of slaw chee we got truffl fri as well my friend order various other item and we wait for our food it came out pretti quick we order item from both the healthi and happi side of the menu for good measur the fri were tasti and veri truffley the cranburkey was a bit on the bland side i have to admit im not typic a big fan of turkey burger so that may have been my own fault for order this my friend was a littl unimpress with her salad say it was a littl bland and wish there was more flavor and divers in textur she enjoy her turkey slider though my other friend got the drunken gypsi french toast and seem to enjoy it quit a bit i had been  tempt by the healthi breakfast item so ill like go that way if i ever come back again

pric werent horribl but it got prici when we had add one and for drink which we end up skip the restaur is tini and 30 minut into our meal there were quit a few peopl hover around wait for tabl so we didnt stay long to chat know peopl were wait this made it a less than ideal place to go if your hope to have a leisur brunch with friend to catch up 

skinnyfat is border between a 3 and 4 star for me but i think ill need to give them anoth tri to see if there are ani other menu item i might enjoy morenotic the new busi list of layer on yelp  it almost the midpoint between the gym and the new hous so whi not take a peak after my morn work out

th lay out is noth like the relat layer in green valley  mean no seat no display case  the server advis me this locat is where they cook for both place  i want to get a few bake item to take on the road so i didnt look at the hang board list the breakfast and lunch item  i notic slim pickin for the bake good sit on some shelv  purchas 

banana chocol chip bread  nice banana and chocol chip tast  strang  the bread felt dens yet the bread was a littl on the dri side  still great flavor

whit chocol chiprasberri bar  delici   the raspberri fill tast great 

oatmeal with i believ caramel and chocol chip  decent  moist dens but not quit sure it all meld together

il definit tri again  hope they have a larger bake good selection

p attachthis place is brand new with a nice comfort atmospher and i was told they are still work on the menu and it will be shorten becaus it way too long 

mi first choic was discontinu from the menu so i went with what they call com ga nuong it was describ as marin grill chicken with ginger lemongrass shallot and garlic it sound realli good ive had this similar dish at a few other vietnames place so i was expect a differ present but the number one thing that bother me about the dish was the lack of the flavor mention in the descript this dish at pho viet onli was garnish with 2 piec of cucumb and two tomato slice and it did come with a larg portion of rice and a veri mild fish sauc with veri fine shred carrot in the fish sauc 

i also did sampl the beef and meatbal pho to me it was less flavor than other ive tri but not aw and just ok

both meal were hot and fresh serv in a time manner 

if you are in the area you should put them on your rotat and see what you think

th owner are veri welcom to critic as i did mention the lack of flavor to them in the chicken dish 

25 round up for welcom criticthis is a solid option for a quick lunch or late night snack  i order two potato taco and an order of chronic fri  you get to choos your top for whatev you order which is nice  there are a decent number of options

th taco were good  the flavor was good and the portion size was ok  the fri are a huge portion  they are best share by sever peopl or multipl meal for one person  the fri are good and they do not skimp with the toppings

th staff was decent and i got my food fair quick5 star for the food 2 star for the experi  averag it out to 35 and round down to 3 becaus the bathroom setup annoy me so much and that pretti much where snooz is at  we live pretti much across the street and had been mean to tri snooz for a while and actual tri to go on sever occas but the extrem wait time and my extrem hunger usual led us elsewher  but this time we had some shop to do at nordstrom rack and figur we would put our name on the list beforehand and final see what kind of culinari masterpiec this place is churn out to warrant up to a 2 hour wait time in an area with about a million other brunch options

w arriv sunday at around 1100 am they gave us a 4560 minut wait time and i was actual impress with how accur it was  we did some shop at got a coupl drink at grassroot next door yes we pregam brunch and all in all it was fine  let it be known that this review is in no way affect by the long wait time to get a tabl  i get that there are onli so mani place we can all sit in a popular restaur and im more than happi that they are bring peopl to town  countri which sidenot doe anyon rememb when the onli reason you went there was trader joe and my sister closet shit cray

howev what irk me is onc you get insid you kind of realiz whi the tabl wait is so long and it not necessarili becaus theyr popular  it becaus they are so slow at bring your food out they appear to have the tabl turnov of a strip club on christma eve  lanc and got on the list at 1119 got our text that our tabl was readi at 1211  by 100 we still had not receiv our food which consist of egg benedict pancak and a breakfast burrito  what exact was the hold up i get that they are busi but isnt that the point of the entri throttl did they just not build a kitchen big enough to serv the restaur at full capac becaus ive been to much bigger restaur with much more vari menus and wait about half the time as this place and this is without the hourlong long wait to even get seat  

then i use the bathroom and it all becam clear  let me paint a pictur the bathroom has two stall it onli has one sink  by put two stall in the bathroom it is impli that snooz expect that at least some of the time they will both be in use and by onli put one sink it is also expect that at least some of the time there will be a line for the sink  fine well wait again  howeverthi sink isnt your averag hand wash  station  this is a hand wash and dri station  so right after your done wash your hand you stand in the exact same spot you know the spot where the person behind you that was in the other stall is wait to wash their hand and proceed to dri your hand with air dryer that stay on for about 3 second and have all the power of a batteri oper necklac fan herebi make it the most ineffici bathroom of all time  if this is how they approach their bathroom i can onli imagin that their kitchen consist of a breakfast burrito station that can onli be use onc someon is done make waffl a pancak griddl that doubl as a bacon skillet and a fri cook who also buss tabl and manag the restaur twitter account  point be that no breakfast restaur should take 45 minut to make food and there is like some process improv that could be put in place to reduc both the food wait and the tabl wait which was the main caus of the 2 star overal experience

i will say the food was veri veri good  i got the late harvest benni which is interest serv on polenta rather than biscuit i love polenta so i was all about it  i also got a bite of sever of the pancak flavor we split a flight which were all pretti fantast  i know they are new and if they ever get their shit togeth enough so there is less than a two hour span between get on the wait list and pay my bill ill definit come back  i realli hope they dowere get a stand snow cream place here as in not from a truck so we dont have to watch our twitter feed obsess you shut the front door 

i was so psych when i heard jet tila was open up this place after have tri similar product in my home turf of southern california the locat is in the same shop center as starbuck but a littl toward the back so dont expect to find it face the come and go of spring mountain traffic 

a huge menu greet custom upon walk in where patron get to choos from either predesign combin of snow cream flavor top and sauc or custom their own you can choos between two size  ninja 20 oz for 550 or sumo 32 oz for 700 after which you can pick up to 3 top 050 for each addit 

i got a ninja kuma snow cream the origin flavor with mochi pop pearl and red bean with condens milk which help becaus the textur is just a tad icier than i initi expect the staff will ask for your name a la starbuck and serv your kuma concoct via a small tray onc it readi 

the mochi harden as expect upon contact with the snow cream but it happen faster than i could eat it all so i might need to rethink that one next time while the red bean was clump but noth a spoon couldnt fix the pop pearl were fun and are like a yogurtflavor parti in your mouth have so mani top though mean that ill need to go back at least a few more time to find out what the perfect combin for my tast bud is thank you kuma for let us exercis our right to choic 

im look forward to frequent this place more  nobodi i know can make it through these vega summer without a sweet treat and pool season is not as forgiv to the allicecream dietthis is the newest place that yelper were talk up befor it open so i was curious to see what the hype was all about  my first experi with this type of snow ice was a coupl of month ago in los angel at new york snow  their snow ice is much smoother than the one at kuma  i ventur to kuma on their second night of busi with my partnerincrim and tri the ninja size kuma snow flavor with mochi red bean coconut and condens milk  i was expect the sheet of shave snow ice like at new york snow but my order didnt look like that  regardless it was still a tasti treatth red bean was delici and fresh  the servic is veri friend and all smile  the joint is nice and bright with a cute sanrio feel to it  stop by and check it out for yourselfanoth nice dessert option in chinatownstop by here saturday night after a show and the place was total pack just befor midnight  good for them  i appreci how well thought out everyth is from the creativ flavor and top to the cute charact and general set up  i am sure theyr think merchandis tv show and the whole lot for bruce tea and mangozilla  it just look so damn coolsnow cream  

but in the end it simpli not my thing  i prefer frozen yogurt instead for the health mani of them could be fake benefit like protein enzym and bacteria i cant spell nor pronounc   plus my dessert doesnt turn into a soupi mess in less than 10 minut  their small size known as ninja was big and more than i need or want  how about consid a smaller size call chiisai or weewe for 4

the first few bite of my mangozilla were quit refresh  i like the capn crunch mix with multicolor mochi and strawberri  the snow cream itself was veri interest  i honest tri to scarf it down as quick as i could despit my snow cream headach becaus i didnt want everyth melt on me  this happen to my wife sinc shes one of the slowest eater in the histori of eat  she actual chuck the whole thing after onli finish half becaus it was just cold weird syrupi soup  she like it less than i did  

ill give it anoth show some other time and tri the taro combin  their flavor combo were realli cool and i can onli imagin how long that whole thing took  

it would be nice to have some outdoor seat tooi was look forward to the open of kuma for a while now ive been and unfortun i dont think i need to go back again i love the store itself  kawaii polar bear and i hope they eventu have the employe shirt for sale as for the snow cream  it was eh just ok 

i know they liter just open but the flavor option are pretti limit compar to fluff ice and the other similar place ive been to i also didnt care for kuma textur as a coupl other mention it kind of ici and not as smooth as other i had the taro w coconut pop pearl lyche and condens milk flavor wise taro was about the same as yogurtland or get a taro boba noth special 

they were out of mochi alreadi and the lyche need to be cut in half  it silli to expect someon to shove an entir half frozen lyche in their mouth the worker also didnt seem to know much about their top when ask what the pop pearl are he said it was like boba it noth like boba  it those juic fill ball that pop i love those anyway but mayb the guy should know what hes sell 

sorri this end up be a btch session but im just realli disappoint seem like kuma is about ador appear more than substanc and btw it irrit me that their interview keep say that kuma mean polar bear  wrong it just mean beari guess im gonna mirror the major of peopl here with my aok rate and feel about it 

i came with tien n to get a treat after lunch and this was close by and the new dig 

i got one of the premad creation the bruce tea  green tea snow red bean pop pearl mochi condens milk the flavor of the green tea was good the textur was eh it a bit ici and while that is not a grave detract it is not what i was expect or prefer i will take other peopl word for it that this is not typic nor ideal snow ice as that fluffi i normal like my stuff pretti plain when it has awesom textur but in this case yes the top make it  ive onli had fruit flavor pop boba and i realli like these white pearl sinc they tast like those asian yogurt drink in the plastic littl bottl with the foil top mochi and red bean were standard as they should be 

the size here were surpris big i got the ninja and while i finish it it probabl more than i want to eat on a usual a 3rd smaller size is probabl a good idea  the girl at the regist was friend enough and i got my creation pretti fast they have a stamp card system so if you like it then youll get a larg size for free eventu 

ill probabl be back at some point as i love frozen treat but im not die to go backi had breakfast here this morn and i didnt want to have a larg breakfast  i order the anaheim taco which consist of anaheim chili sour cream sauté onion a blend of three chees a slice of avocado all place on a taco with scrambl egg

th taco was not a flour one  it was more like a pastri crust rather than a flour tortilla but it was veri good  the menu say that all breakfast taco are serv with potato or refri bean and rice  i was offer neither  i did have a choic of mild medium or hot for the salsa and i chose hot  it mild hot if that not an oxymoron
breakfast was good and the server refil my coffe when he saw i was get low

thi place just open a month ago and theyr still do work on it  this morn they were instal a garag door in the bar area that can be rais in good weather and serv from a counter on which the door rest today

part of the fun of eat here today was watch my server chang the coke cartridg  the syrup now come in super concentr contain that look like copi machin cartridg and it was interest watch him switch out two of the cartridg the chang in technolog was interesting

i park underground in the neonopoli garag and there was no charg  i dont know if it becaus of the time of day or that i was there less than an hour but this is the second time that the cashier at the pay station just wish me a good day and open the gate

nacho daddi is worth a return visit when they get the kink work out and gentlemen aim for a field goalbutterfli wonderland just open up may 25th and there were a lot of famili and coupl line up to experi america newest and largest butterfli conservatori 

admiss is about 19 for each adult with senior and student discount when you enter you have the choic of see the 3d movi or move onward to the next room the movi is around 15 minut and show off the 3d view and pretti imageri rather than a lot of inform discuss about the monarch butterfly

aft the movi you enter a room that showcas the differ pupa that are in the process of transform into a butterfli sinc there was a larg crowd when we went there was a littl bit of a wait for patron in the actual conservatori to exit befor more could enter

th actual conservatori is a photographi student dream the landscap is a bit ether as various butterfli flutter by you some may even land on you for a quick second befor take off again although we did have a guid to the differ speci of butterfli in our brochur there wasnt much els in term of educ about the differ butterflies

th next section after the conservatori show a honeybe coloni and sever ant coloni the ant coloni in agar were light up with neon make it look like the ant were have a rave it was cool to see the honeybe with the queen mark with a green dot to differenti her from the other bees

ther is also a set of nice aquarium and a touch pool with stingray the aquarium was a weird addit to a butterfli conservatori i thought the fish were all freshwat common speci you could find at your nearest petsmart eg african cichlid various gourami neon tetra there were a few sign list the speci but not all the aquarium were label like the butterfli section the stingray and fish section didnt have a lot of educ inform in them 

it took us about an hour to brows through everyth the experi here is nice but it more of a visual experi rather than a learn one some thing that might be good for the exhibit are more inform about butterfli conserv whi the differ speci of butterfli are differ color and how differ cultur view butterfli sinc there are so mani children that visit the conservatori it would be nice for them to be entic to learn about natur in addit to the visual interact beauti of the butterfliif i had to sum up this place in one word random 

i came here for the first time on a friday night it was a good mix of young and middleag local and nonloc there is so much go on here you go in get a drink from the bar and partak in whatev float your boat

ther live music go on in the backyard along with some game like lifes beer pong corn hole lifes jenga etc insid youll find a foosbal tabl pool dart shuffleboard connect four and mani other game that i may have missed

boytoy was right when he said this place is like an adult daycarive alway wonder whi the empti space next to postino east wasnt occupi by someth and now final i got my wish  from the owner of postino  the upward project have roll out anoth concept restaurantbar  this time it a taco shop i love everyth from the up especi postino and i love mexican food so i was veri excit for this new place  how can go wrong right  

the good
you can expect the attent servic youv expect from postino with lot of server alway check up on you  and of cours all the server are attract and easi on the eye  
the décor is alway interest a mix between modern with southwest but more texa southwest as oppos to mexican southwest  but never the less it also easi on the eye 
the food is fressssh and tast like everyth is made from scratch  after eat a few taco you dont get that greasi heavi guilti feel as you would elsewher  it seem like everi item on the menu was creat individu with it own recip and tast  no 2 taco tast the same so youll definit have to tri them all out
th seafood is def the highlight of the place  esp the scallop  scallop cevich is good and the scallop taco is fab  the fish taco are great too especi the batter crispi one
ok so i lie the drink are the highlight of the place  they have a good size list of specialti drink that they creat themselv  but not so long that it intimid that what she said  i like that it just not a mexican restaur and their onli drink are margarita they have a realli good varieti and they all tast good  the drink would be the onli reason to come back
they have a nice chill patiooutdoor that you can go and just hangout and drink on

th bad
although everi taco has it individu tast that doesnt mean each tast is good there are some tast and combin that realli just make you wonder  esp the chicken taco  
although the seafood taco are great the regular meat is just ok  ive been all around az eat all type of mexican food and id like to consid myself an expert of tast tasti taco and joyrid nonseafood taco are deff a lacklust  they just dont have the same tast the flavor the ooooommmph as other the carn asada the chicken and the pork carnitas
they have 6 differ salsa howev onli one of them is hotspici  howev the spici gradient is steep were talk tomato sauc to melt your face off  but no in betweens
th music is def like that of a bar  american 80s90s and some contemp rock  isnt this a taco shop atleast some mexican music you can even do spanish rock 
the ambianc is loud like el hefe loud but with more hipster and less dbag if you want to have a quiet convers def sit outsid or go next door to postinos

th ugly
everyth here is expens 4 is the averag price of one taco yes one taco  the scallop is mkt price so you dont know what it is  although they are big and thought made 4 is much 
they charg extra for salsa  extra for salsa what  most mexican place have a salsa bar that you can choos from for free  it 2 for a small bowl of salsa  

pros
great seafood tacos
great drink specialties
great atmosphere

con
veri american that it bare mexican
everyth is expens 4 per taco 2 for salsa 12 for ceviche
loud and borderlin el hefe likeshudders

i would def come here to grab drink and chill out on the patio but that about ityou cant go to a taco place and not tri the taco right 

mi friend told me about this place and want to tri it out when you first sit down you get complementari chip and salsa it was noth special it was a bit spici for my tast i order the carn asada taco and the crispi fish taco i wasnt too fond of the carn asada taco it was a bit dri and bland and i felt like it need sauc or sour cream or someth with it the crispi fish taco were realli good though beer batter fish and guacamol got me lol i wash everyth down with the strawberri agua fresca it was delici it has vodka gin and rum in it id like to tri their spike horchata next time i come for dessert we order the churro con chocol which was quit yummi 

the custom servic was realli good we were alway taken care of and the staff is veri knowledg of their menu 

the onli negat for me was there was no sign on the restaur i drove up and down the street for like 15 minut and i couldnt find it i had to call my friend to find out where it was the onli sign they have is on the door which is definit not notic at night time i know they are a new establish but i felt like a huge sign shouldv been the first thing to take care of i never wouldv found it at all 

all in all i realli like their drink and will probabl come back dure happi hour to tri the rest of their drink menu firefli is a decent and not too expens altern to the mani overpr las vega restaur on the strip unfortun there are some mediocr tapa here to go along with their good tapa and servic was poor on my visit

th strip is fill with overpr restaur that churn out mediocr food  whether you are go to a fine dine restaur or a cafe charg fine dine entre price chanc are you are go to leav the restaur feel like you did not get much for your money  off the strip though you will find more local spot and more bang for your buck in good qualiti and not outrag pricey restaur like lotus of siam some may find lotus of siam pricey but it is noth like the vega fine dine spot charg sometim twice as much as what that restaur would cost in los angel or other cities

firefli is off the strip and it is a local spot  it is a longstand tapa restaur with a huge follow and mayb even a bigger menu  with the big menu it is not surpris that some dish shine while other underwhelm  here is the rundown

anchovi toast with avocado i like these toast  it was nice have the flavor anchovi as well as the creami from the fresh avocado

bacon wrap date stuf with blue chees and smoke almond red wine reduct the bacon was crispi and the date was sweet and i like the blue chees  the crunchi almond was kind of odd and i did not like the red wine reductionunnecessari and it kind of made the bacon wrap date over sugari and soggi if you did not pluck the bacon wrap date out of the dish as soon as they came out

camaron a la diabla shrimp sweet and spici sauc grill bread the shrimp was nice cook and plump and the sauc had a good amount of heat a littl too bbq saucelik though

artichok toast aioli basil pepper the artichok heart were goodnot as good as the anchovi toast but still satisfying

heirloom tomato burrata butter lettuc basil balsam vinaigrett the heirloom tomato were surpris juici for not be in season and the burrata was veri creami almost as good as the more expens burrata at mario batali bb ristorant in the venetian  palazzo  unfortun the butter lettuc was drench in balsam which made this good green into noth more than decor garnish for the plate

empanada with pork red pepper cream chees and aioli i am not familiar with empanada but i thought these were good  they have sever other type of empanada available

padron pepper these flashfri pepper had a nice light outsid skin and some good heat  they would be a nice addit to mani dishes

chicken and chorizo stuf mushroom a surpris amount of heat

albondiga meatbal in a sherri and tomato sauc with parmesan these meatbal were averag stuff in a simpl tomato sauc  i would have prefer fresh grate parmesan to the melt parmesan chees here which felt like it had been melt a long time ago and had been sit around for a while

camaron al ajillo shrimp lemon and garlic butter sauc the shrimp were fine but i thought the lemon butter and scampilik sauc was just okay  still it was not too heavi or oili i think mani would like it

steak and mushroom skewer filet roast garlic cream sauc i thought these were averag the meat was a tad dry

fri calamari standard calamari

dessert were satisfi  the caramel flan had a good flavor and the right textur and while the ice cream did not have an incred creami consist the portion was generous and the flavor were pretti good chocol vanilla pistachio  the chocol tres lech cake definit had the expect moist of a tres lech cake as well as a light chocol flavor

pric were reason  the food was decent and you do not have to pay the outrag price that you have to pay on the strip

servic was poor  the staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace but the staff was not attent  after put in our order the staff was pretti nonexist so get drink and water glass refil and receiv the bill took way too long

firefli has a dark and loud atmosphere

firefli is a good spot if you want a decent meal in las vega but do not want to pay the typic outrag vega price  it remind me a lot of long beach cafe sevilla in term of menu choic and the qualiti of the food though that long beach restaur has much better service

firefli has it own park lot i believ it might be valet park thoughgf and i opt for hh for my father day meal at least i thought it was my meal  after look at the yelp pic and the menu it sudden becam the gf meal  she order virtual everyth with littl to no input from me

the nacho fell short  we dig the ingredi  potato chip cheddar chees short rib with horseradish sour cream  the problem  some of the chip were stale the chees with the short rib creat a consist of beef stroganoff  not a bad tast but not what i want  and the serv size   serious 

the polenta bite  love the green goddess dip  fresh tarragon tast  but the bite were too dang small   whi not put blue chees insid them  seem like you put blue chees on most the item on the menu  and yes i love blue chees

i left the place with a similar feel i had at nosh  swig  i like the concept i like what i read on the menu  san price  but the dish were inconsist and general speak improp execution

butterscotch pud with snicker doodl cooki  a bit too sweet im not a fan 25

i was not impressoh i so want to realli love this place but ala i found it just ok  i love the idea of farm to tabl dine but this place is just lack something

w went here over the weekend while we were hang out at tivioli villag for the harvest festiv  the mail was pack but ogden was empti  there were onli 2 other tabl in the entir place  it alway a littl odd to eat in an empti restaur  

we tri the fish  chip and the chili with cornbread  both item were good but onli good  at 17 for fish  chip seem realli high  the chili and bread was 6 which i thought was a great deal  i have had better rich  chip at other place and for much less moolah  

the server tare all veri friend  we had my 2 year old wit us so she attract all of the ladi work which she love  our drink were never empti which is alway a bonus  our server check on us regular as well

if you are into beer ogden had a great beer list with a lot of the smaller region breweri from the west coast  

so hop and harvest is ok in my book  just dont expect it to blow your sock offeggstat there a new breakfast joint that just open up here in the anthem area in the strip mall along eastern between horizon ridg and sunridg heights

i just did a quick glanc of the menu but wasnt feel ani of their omelett select till the  breakfast hawaiian style section caught my eye they offer 3 differ meal spam or portugues sausag with rice and egg loco moco egg rice burger patti top wbrown gravi  and the haol moco western version with countri gravi  i went for the haol one   it was made right with rice on the bottom layer with the burger patti and top with gravi and 2 egg  i  just i didnt like the burger patti as much i also thought more gravi is need becaus the rice soak it all up befor i could finish it  otherwis not too bad  afterthought  i shouldv order someth on the lighter side
 
the place is plenti big bright and airi  there is seat outsid face the busi street or you can sit at the counter or seat yourself in their larg dine area  the window face west has a nice view of the anthem area
 
minor hiccup on servic  i seat myself per sign at entri and wait a few minut till someon realiz i wasnt be wait on yet a server approach my tabl when she realiz i wasnt help yet and apolog for me be the onli one there at the time and the 12 of them not tend to my tabl yet mayb becaus everyon is still green or it was still too earli in the day who know  i dont mind that they give you the check right away and you pay at the counter at your conveni but it is a pain and i do think the flip to yellow egg for helpservic system is pretti lame

i like that this place open pretti earli and they offer differ choic for breakfast and brunch time and look forward to tri more food from their menu but i have to say i still prefer the breakfast bakeri cafe that has that savori waffl sandwich and chop kale salad across the wayive done crack egg broken yolk in ca and now egg work  yesthi was my first time to an egg work i even had the egg and i bookmark for quit some time it taken me so long to tri egg worksth egg and i becaus the wait was alway too long i was fortun one sunday morn to check out this new locat in henderson with a group of bpfs best peep forev  and for an ad bonus the wait was onli 20 minut  not bad for a new breakfast hot spot not bad for a sunday morn 

besid lunch and dinner breakfast is my favorit meal of the day  and when it come to breakfast at a place like this my order is usual as bore as it get i usual get some type of omelet or anyth with egg  you cant eat at a place name egg work for the first time and not have their egg i had them creat an 6 egg white omelet with spinach  mushroom  for an ad touch i had 3 strip of turkey bacon ad  let me say that this meal was so good that i felt i just had a cheat meal the omelet was fluffi and tasti but the it the mushroom that was the key to ad flavor to it egg work has more than just egg and omelet like countri fri steak chili spaghetti waffl and pancak  i just didnt get the opportun on this trip  and by the way the price here are pretti good too 

like i state earlier the wait wasnt too long even though this joint was pack the servic was great and our waiter was veri attent  when your done follow the foot print on the floor to the regist

yelp person challeng 2013  408500i want to tri this place base on the review of the pretzel from a friend 

we came in for dinner with a buddi of our our friend order a beer but when the waitress brought it she said they were out of what he want but the bartend pour someth els to tri eh i wasnt a fan of that idea he had a second beer in mind he would have order if she simpli said they were out instead he was stuck with a dale pale ale and hes never been a fan so that was a wast of money sinc he didnt want to be rude and ask her to dump it and get him someth els our server also wasnt the best at refil our sodawat 

i order the garlic butter and parmesan pretzel with beer chees for the tabl three pretzel three of usit seem like fate although i wish there had been 4 so i could have had 2 they were awesom cook perfect the beer chees was so good i would have lick the contain clean if i had been on my couch and not in public 

each of the guy order a pizza one had the thai dye which was tast much better than it sound i cant rememb what our buddi ate 
i order the stuf portabella mushroom as an entre their pizza came out a good 78 minut befor my mushroom so they were almost done eat befor i got my dinner noth wors than stare at your friend eat while you sit there with noth in front of you when our server came to check on us she didnt seem concern that i didnt have my dinner yet just assur me it was come keep in mind it took forev to get our pizza in the first place

fin my dinner arriv and it was yummi i engulf it in as few as 4 bite and caught right up to the guy i would definit order this again 

i understand the hype for the pretzel and despit the fact my mushroom was great you cant realli screw up a mushroom noth was phenomen the servic was lack she kept disappear for a long time our drink went unfil we were stuck with beer we never would have order but had to pay for and our food didnt come out at the same time nor did it arriv in a time manner 

the next time im in the mood for pizza it wont be for this place i might be will to tri it again but it will not be my first choicjust rememb that aok and 3 star is my way of say yes this is a locat worth visit and then you can make your own decision

on a recent busi trip i end up in henderson stay just south of ph just off so eastern it made ph a conveni prepar food sourc i did dinner on tuesday earli even i order their turkey burger with lettuc in place of a bun and i also order a custom pick veggi bowl all was good and i also order a hot tea 

mi onli issu with this type of specialti restaur is the experi of enter and order ph doesnt realli make a newbi feel compet frank i didnt know where to go or what to look at when i enter and when i mention that to the coupl in front of me they said onli becaus they had been there befor did they know the routin 

while the young ladi at the counter were help this wasnt my idea of a possibl franchisereadi busi it was more a place made for those who had been befor and knew the routin and menu i hadnt been there befor and certain didnt know their menu i felt like the owner miss the point of go over the design of the first three minut a client enter 

other than my nitpick i did enjoy my turkey burger and veggi it was a much better option than where i use to go to when travel high carb and high sugar entre out my way it call bbq   as you walk into mayuri palac immedi you inhal exot aromat fragranc from the food and your mouth water anticip what you might try

mani thing i realli like a lot from and about mayuri buffet so i will start with those thing first

of cours i couldnt tri everyth but by a landslid to me the best dish were the vegan dish and this would have been a solid four star review if i onli tri the vegan dish the dish were all differ but the one thing they all had in common were that they were wild flavor and veri spici some of the name of the dish were pongal kosthu dal fri and  butter masala

out of the meat dish i tri the chilli chicken was moist and veri flavor and good

dur my stay butler naan bread was serv and latter a crisp kind of crepe stuf with a season potato and pepper fill and latter yet a laci sort crepe wrap

th thing i didnt care for

thre other chicken dish i tri had veri dri non develop with flavor chicken they were the tandori biryani and masala i also tri the cod curri i couldnt eat that one either becaus the fish had that like purchas from frys or safeway tast it wasnt bad but it was that non fresh tast but i do note fish from almost ani buffet anywher usual isnt good 

mi husband onli took meat dish and didnt care for them and dislik the goat most becaus of the meat dryness 

they had mani desert but i narrow it down to three to tri i didnt care for ani of them the worst one was the one that resembl a donut hole it was fresh made of lumpi thick raw batter and was horribl anoth resembl a funnel cake but also had this raw textur the carrot halwa was so sweet i thought my teeth would fall out that was  almost good

servic was clunki they pour us water but didnt ask us if we want beverag till we were almost done we also didnt receiv the naan bread until we were half way done

th pavement outsid is uneven in one spot and is hazardous

buffet do differ from day to day and hour to hour mayb some day they could be better

35 star i would go back becaus the vegan dish were veri  tastithe food was just ok but the servic was realli friend and attent which almost made me bump them up to four star almost 

i arriv with groupon in hand they gave us a small menu instead of the main menu that we were to order from we start with the xiao long bao they werent the best ive ever had but i had been crave them and was happi to have anoth place in town that offer them we also tri some hot  sour soup and strawberri juic to start both were refresh for our entre we order the sauté black pepper eggplant honey walnut shrimp and pineappl chicken i didnt like the pineappl chicken in the least but my mom enjoy it the shrimp was just ok as well too mayonnaisey for my tast the eggplant was ok as well sizzl and smell great i would probabl order a protein next time instead but it had a nice flavor the mix seafood noodl we got were just ok as well the flavor was ok but the noodl textur were a littl off they were all stuck togeth and a littl overcook 

overal the food was pretti solid and i enjoy some dish more than other im open to tri this place again and i see potenti sinc they have a veri extens menu for now ill leav it at three starwas in the area sinc a friend live down here and we decid to tri this littl ice cream place ive never notic befor 

they serv ice cream and gelato varieti here and even have some sugar free option their ice cream they includ mix in that they hand knead in on a cold stone slab 

the bf got vanilla ice cream with browni and it was pretti good flavor and textur my pistachio had decent flavor but the nut were chop almond and not pistachio there were some ice chunk as i ate it so consist can be improved

they were friend in there and let us tri samples

prob stick with the ice cream unless they improv the airi of the gelatoi realli hate to give this place 3 star becaus their staff was all amaz accommod and friend the three star are for the fact that their staff tri so hard and i can appreci their patienc in regard to a situat i wit that would easili drain anyon of patienc with custom 

howev the food was a huge let down i onli tri the pork cutlet and spam musubi the cutlet was dri and over fri while the katsu sauc was just extrem off it may be becaus ive been accustom to how i believ it is suppos to tast due to past experi the spam musubi had too much sweet daikon in it that it overpow the musubi which is hard to do consid spam is so salti it was also greasi and fell apart quit easili i may give them anoth chanc and tri a simpler menu item im open to chang my review to a better rate if they can step up the qualiti of their foodwe came here on a tuesday afternoon and had 4 ayc for 3022 

 best for a no frill straight to the point cheap chines buffett
 wanton soup seem over cook broken wanton with pork float out of the wanton
 at the similar price as panda express id say this place is worth the money  
 mongolian bbq section was close for is dure the lunch hours
 for a better altern chines style buffett there is buffet at asia and krazi buffet
 free ayc on your bday but not for your groups
 entre to get
1 tofu and eggplant 
2 fri shrimp and crab 
3 fri wanton and calamari 
 dessert to get
1 fri donut and banana 
2 sesam ball 
 flat screen on espn
 averag tast same oil like after flavor  
 hit or miss fresh left over fri shrimp but fresh tofu refil onli when low 
 cheapest buffet ive been to in lv great for group dont come for date this is for susten haha you know like eat lot to save more money to gambl kinda foodive been wait for this place to open sinc it so close to the hous i drove by our the other night to see some peopl in the bar and got excit to know that it was final open 

mi friend and i went there yesterday for some food start with the servic it was good our water cup were alway fill and they check in on us a lot although at some point it was a bit incess but if rather have over the top servic than no servic at all plus we were the onli tabl there for awhil our server deena made thing a bit awkward there was just a lot of awkward silenc and it alway seem like she was whisper but i can look past that 

as far as the food goe it felt like there were more appet to choos from then there were entre which probabl is a good thing becaus the appet we got were far better than the entre 

we start with the portobello fri and the crispi gnocchi the fri were thick slice of portobello that were light bread then fri theyserv it with ranch and some other sauc that im fall to rememb the crispi gnocchi had italian sausag pesto pea and walnut while it was good unless you get a piec of sausag in everi bite the dish lack a bit of salt 

for entre we offer the turkey and cranberri sandwich as well as the jambalaya i dont know what o was expect out of the turkey and cranberri sandwich but i was just expect more while the cranberri sauc was good they ad quit a bit so it overpow everyth els their version was a littl more spruce up with spinach and brie chees howev the chees wasnt spread at all just one slice in the middl so i onli got one or two realli good bite out of the sandwich as far as the jambalaya it was decent had good flavor but just need more it war veri mild tast chicken was con ti perfect though so moist  no sausag in the jambalaya thigh  

all in all would i go back  probabl it the closest place to eat next to my hous ill probabl stick with just order more appet next time thoughtalk about an extrem makeov they did an amaz job renov the spot former occupi by nagoya what onc was dark and dingi is now open airi and eleg 

the food was hit or miss the light and fluffi crispi gnocchi had great flavor and a nice varieti of textur unfortun that was the highlight of the meal the tuna tartar was domin by an acid and fruiti flavor the meatbal stuf with date and bacon were ok but the sauc lack depth then there was the octopus i like eat octopus when it slice or chunk of larg tentacl the version here is present as 3 tini whole octopi i cant say i was a fan too chewi even for normal octopus standards

they do have a kid menu so that a plus for anyon with a famili servic was great but then again there was onli one other parti therethe sparkl has a great concept and a lot of potenti but not quit there yet my friend and i came here saturday night for dinner and our expect fell short on the ambianc menu item and servic unfortun the review written thus far are veri mislead in fact im a bit disappoint with yelp for the first time in a long time

food
th food is not bad but you are definit get what you pay for we decid to do 45 of their appet to get a tast of the menu  not the best choic the capres salad had roma tomato that were thin and not quit ripe yet the brown butter gnocchi were dri and tast like frozen tater tot that were reheat you would think that with an item descript of brown butter gnocchi with butternut squash  it would have some time of sauc or butter  nopejust dri gnocchi and dri out over cook roast butternut squash cube  our save grace was the smoke salmon crostini and meatbal 

servic  
we had an issu with one of our cours and the server seem a bit put out and offend with our feedback and then what made the matter wors is the manag came by after it was fix and from 5 feet away said are you better now and then walk off dont get me wrong he was nice about it and did his tabl touch as a profession gestur but a further convers on what was wrong with our dish seem more appropri for a slow night than a shout convers across the room from then on we were ignor by the manag while he laugh and danc his way from everi other tabl in the restaur  the whole restaur had mayb 5 tabl total and the server had each cours come out so fast and we felt rush the whole time  the server was veri nice but definit not polished

ambience
veri cute decor concept with the french countri sheek theme but the beauti valour chair and stun chandeli did not pair well with the paper napkin and casual waitstaff attir   also the bar area is distract with the tvs and loud peopl  perhap the restaur could have a curtainwal up to block the view for peopl on a romant date night and a separ entranc for the bar area so  the drunk peopl stumbl in dont have to walk by my tabl actingdress like they are at pts 
i will tri it again onc theyr on their feet longer mayb for a happi hour but wouldnt recommend it as of now to a friend 

last comment can we take down the xmas treedecor now it januari 12thive been anxious wait for max to open sinc when they said they were go to open back in august my famili and i went here at 6pm and there was a bunch of filipino wait outsideoh no we were told there was a 40minut wait so my sister ask how long it would take for a togo order 30 minut we stood outsid and 10 minut later our tabl was readi everyon lololola titotita atekuya and barkadakaibigan were here

filipino 101
where is da cr  where is the bathroom
sarap  deliciit the infam max franchis now final locat in las vega we just had to go tri it the establish is veri nice and upscal a lot better than most filipino restaur but the food and servic was ok they were out of sisig and kare kare which appar his the most popular dish i was super bum to find that we couldnt order it sinc that was all i was look forward to other dish includ chicken adobo beef steak and pancit bihon and palabok and sinigang 

you can also divid or section off part of the place if your look to celebr here with a big parti which is pretti cool the servic was good and thi were veri attent and apologet to us when they were out of certain dish howev to be out of not just one dish but twoi feel pose a problem if your tri to servic your custom becaus they expect to have whatev is on the menumax max max max bout damn time you open up onli for me to find out that you still have a lot of kink to work out base on review and word of mouth so i was think  a coupl month should give you enough time to get your st together

fast forward to monday januari 6th 7 pm dinner time 8 of us show up and are seat in a time manner so far servic seem legit

w order garlic fri rice lechon kawali sizzil tofu chicken sisig pakbet sinigang na baboy fri bangus and of cours max fri chicken we end our feast with buko pandan and halohalo for dessert

w got our food rather quick again servic seem veri good it was not until we got all our food that the i notic our server disappear we were enjoy our food but was wonder when we were go to get refil on all our drink we also want to order dessert i would say we did not see our server for a good 15 minut we end up flag anoth server to find out where our server was 

so he final come back to attend to our need as i told him that we need refil and to order dessert i smell the strong odor of cigarett smoke all over him and his breath as he acknowledg our need dude now we know where he has been he obvious was on his break smoke pop a breath mint or 20 i hope he at least wash his hand memo to upper manag or whoever is in charg of hire and train your server either you need to do a better job of keep an eye on your employe or hire better server i mean when somebodi goe on break someon els is suppos to cover temporarili until that person come back 

so we get our refil final and our dessert at this point i just want to finish and pay up so we can get out of there

overal i was actual impress at the begin until our server went on his break it such a shame too becaus the food was 4 star worthi but the servic was no better than a 2 so this is where i can justifi my rate of 3 at this point in time mayb in anoth coupl month or whenev i feel that enough time has pass for you big wig to final pay attent to these review that have a common theme and actual do someth about it until then i predict your averag will not go ani higher than a 3

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 8when i found out this place was open in vega i was pretti thrill be filipino you have to know what max chicken is if you dont than you need to chang your ethnic lol ¯ツ¯ 

ive had max chicken in california but today was the first time i had it in vega this place is pretti spiffi the insid is realli nice big broad window individu room for larg parti veri spacious im veri impress with the layout especi in that part of town 

for food we had order fri chicken duh kare kare sisig sizzl tofu caldereta and sinigang all were pretti good they are known for the chicken so i had no complaint about it especi if you dip it in banana ketchup yum other food ive honest had better the sizzl tofu was probabl the onli thing i would come back  order again it had a good kick to it  the sauc they serv it with was awesom the sisig didnt tast like ani kind i have ever had kare kare was alright had better 

also the soda they serv us was flat even told them it was they brought anoth round of soda which was also flat took forev to get a round of water for everyon my glass of water was empti for a while befor someon notic and fill it 

they dont includ gratuiti on the bill even with larg parti which i thought was differ but they do show what you should tip at the bottom of the receiptok so i as well had been wait to go to this place after i saw them open
i had wait quit awhil till i did
not becaus i did not want to but becaus i alway have my list of my 6 most import thing to do while in town 
i final made it a point to stop in
i am sorri to say i was veri disappointed
 but i am go to give them anoth chanc again veri soon
th store is realli larg so they have an opportun to do a lot with it 
it was extrem dark in there though i can appreci keep the light low when it is sooo hot outsid but it dark too dark to me with the huge concret floor
i order a few bake good to take with me
i realli do love to support local busi they were realli good but for some reason i was expert fabul food and bake goods
a i say i will tri them again anyon can have the rough day the servic was veri nice i was just let down on the decor and the choic 
i even bought 2 contain of tea as well as the bake good 
i want to help keep it go you know 
i will post in the futur about the french groceri  so i will let you know
park is right out front sometim a bit tightlook like this place was an old 711 at one time the front has been redon and the insid is simpli redecor it is more like a small conveni store with the scent of a french bakeri in the air

they basic have some tabl to eat at and some display case with bakeri good chees and readi made meal in the cooler section veri simpl with a lot of potenti seen a lot of peopl enjoy some french press coffe and a treat on the side

pick up some some readi cook new orlean style red bean from the fridg to bring home had my eye on some andouill gumbo and their shrimp etouffe i wonder if it is as good as mine hmmm

could not resist get a chocol eclair and some pralin bacon ok mayb a coupl bag of those hard to get tasti zapp chip for a midnight snack

would like to see more inventori and a larger select of bake good i was expect a littl bit more of a present did not know you had to cook it at home and not eat it there hmmm

check them out and dont forget  pralin bacon rule dont just stand there like an idiot if there are no hostess or anyon to greet you when you walk in just claim a seat at the bar or stake a claim to ani tabl and make yourself at home  just dont get too carri away and take off your smelli shoe or walk around in your undi  except will howev be grant on a case by case basi but dont even bother unless you can make play rock paper scissor look sexi similar to what the mma ring girl can do just by breathing

so you think you are into craft beer  then buddi this might be the place for you to hit up they have 30 select on the craft beer list and is updat frequent  just keep in mind that their inventori doe not seem to be veri deep therefor your first coupl of select may be unavailable

i dont drink but there are occas when i feel like watch the latest game and get someth to eat at bar like ace  ale  lucki for me their burger and salad are abov averag in the bar food category

if you want good servic then sit your ass at the bar  the tabl along the wall and on the other side of the bar are for larger parti but servic level is not so great which was mention in sever previous reviews

so on this particular occas i order myself the arrog bastard steak salad  it was an entré size salad with nice cook steak slice up serv on top of mix green  if you are not in the mode for an abov averag burger from a bar consid order this  you will probabl send me a messag thank me later

a friend of mine was be adventur or mayb just look to find a decent chicken and waffl spot in las vega so that was what he order  i tri some of it but we both agre that it was no bueno  mucho disappoint my friend was as he was wish he had gone the rout of an entré salad  well that was the tini voic of experi that i did not ignor this time

w also split an order of fri chees curd with the dip sauc it was a decent appet  i am sure it will not be hard to finish this as you engross yourself in the game shown on tv or the video poker at the bar while snacking

anyway great spot for craft beer lover and a hidden gem for abov averag bar foods

review 7 of 2014beauti decor and spacious restaur delici drink good sashimi

a for the teppanyaki i thought it was a rather averag experi essenti your pay 20 for a plate of mediocr veget fri rice that some chef made in front of you and what up with the pink past that they use to fri the rice with it made everyth pink and unpleas look your better off spend the money on someth els here

if i ever come back here it would be for the drink and sushi onliwent here for happi hour 4pm9pm had a japanes lasagna sushi roll 7 and a 3 piec sampler 5 just look at the sushi menu it seem a littl spendi i get japanes lasagna everywher i go and this one was just ok 
the restaur is veri nice with about 5 teppanyaki tabl insid and 2 out on the patio which is pretti cool ive alway thought geisha steak hous had the best teppanyaki meal in vega i just havent had one for awhil 
drink here were just ok as well noth excit to rave about had a strawberri martini and a sakeging mojito id come here for the cool ambianc again servic was pretti good tootri go a few day ago but the place was mob  opt for a post workout visit figur few will be there when they open

clean space with an island  surfer  motif  big surpris  

they offer smoothi  price rang from 4 to 6

coffe  didnt notic if coldblend nor did i check the price  

the main item  hawaiian ice  price 289 to 599   i went with the regular 16 ounc 349  larg list of flavor i opt for pineappl and super sour cherry

both flavor work  for me  more of a fruit tast than sweet tast  the sour was far from  super but it work for me  the ice was fluffi with onli 3 minor  chunk in the ice  sorri i aint an ice specialist so not sure where it rate with the other recent ice place that have open  i felt the ice did compet with snow ono

overal a pleasant experi and ill return

p attachcool you and your love one down with a smoothi shake or shave ice in this tri tripl digit heat and intent or unintent do a good deed for everi smoothi or shake purchas you are help to feed a local child in need via three squar food bank is simpli way cool

unless you have a custom crave that can onli be met by your uniqu blend of flavor engin you can easili get veri nice preformul hous combo in the shake and smoothi depart  probabl save a buck too  

the morn after shake is the most unconvent with bacon oj and mapl syrup in the concoct  i might order it if the bacon was bake crisp and render of most of it otherwis flavor bacon greas  this will like appeal to the i dare you kid  kid at heart crowd  although everyon i know that was at the grand open thought about get this bacon shake none actual went through and order it to pop their fgs cherry

sinc nutella basic goe well with just about ani dessert but was not featur in ani of the exist hous design shake i was forc to architect my own blend with hershey cooki  cream chocol bar  nutella with a base of nonfat yogurt and lowfat milk  the result was okay but not the nutella chocol bliss i was hope for  i hypothes that the same amount of nutella is ad to a 16 oz order as the 24 oz order thus the larger the size the more dilut the flavor  

the shake was also loos in consist not the thicker shake that requir you to channel your inner dyson vacuum power to get it through the boba straw  viscos of the shake could also be affect by the huge turnout at the grand open event  big line of custom that went out the door for 2 hour straight  less or insuffici amount of time for the frozen yogurt machin to semifreez the yogurt mixtur befor it was dispens into blender as order came in  

nelson q was also at the fgs grand open festiv and order the almondcado which he said was good  so next time i go that will be what i will tri from their smoothi menu 

i will be back to give it anoth tri when the order condit is more normal  plus it is for a good causlast night was the grand open festiv for this new place that has been open a few week  there was a dj the slidin thru truck face paint a yelp tabl with costum idea and some game for the kid of all ages

on to the reason i came  i order their nut about browni shake medium size that they call mid  this is one of the shake theyv design although you can design your own  mine had blend browni rees and peanut butter blend with milk  the shake was veri good but i shudder to think about the number of calori it had  it could have use a bit more blend as the bottom end with some larg browni piec and some chunk of peanut butter  all in all it was ok

they have a menu from which you can design your own shake  use caution becaus the price and the calori can add up

thi was anoth chanc to get with some yelp friend and enjoy some good convers along with the refresh drink  i dont think ill be a regular  it just too rich and sugarithe skinni at the end of the meal i had a half fill bowl of broth  nuff said 3 servic effici and fast 3 valu it okay  not too pricey for a bowl of okay ramen but noth that i feel like i need to return for 3 stars

when we saw the sign for a new ramen joint open up in the chinatown area we were stoke we love ramen  tonkotsu ramen in particular  and we were veri interest to find a ramen joint that serv the tradit thinner white noodl with their tonkotsu broth

w head over to their soft open just to see what they had to offer i believ that their menu is truncat a bit at this time no matter  we decid to hit up their tonkotsu ramen 777 2 pc chasu green onion ginger and woodear mushroom and their ramen tatsu basic a tonkotsu ramen with more chasu and in bigger bowl of noodles

okay let me get this straight ramen for me is all about the broth that is the most difficult part to get right and where all the flavor come from in your bowl if i am leav a bowl of ramen with at least half a bowl of broth behind that say someth  it just aint that good the tonkotsu broth didnt have the luxuri porki depth that it need to realli distinguish itself from other ramen joint in the city

on to the rest of the bowl the chasu in the bowl didnt realli have much of a marin flavor with it and render it a bit bland the noodl  although they were the legit kind  were a littl too soft for my tast i would also ventur to say the bright pink ginger top should be left to the side instead of incorpor in the bowl i was also a littl sad that the wasnt the option of ad an egg to your bowl perhap this oversight will be correct after the soft opening

anoth thing of note was they did not have togarashi to go with the ramen  onli the chili oil as my hub is a total togarashi fanboy he was verili disappointed

servic is quick and effici i believ we were in and out within half and hour

overal in the big scheme of thing ramen tatsu is alright howev base on the offer today i dont feel a huge urg to return again soon3 star reviewthis place is pretti fun the staff can get a littl forget and zone out a littl but they are pretti upbeat whi not 4 star it a bit pricey for a burgerbar joint i unfortun didnt order a burger i just order mozzarella stick to munch on while my friend order a full meal the mozzarella stick were pretti decent i usual say motsi stick can be determin by the marinara sauc if you have good marinara you have good motzi stick their sauc was pretti decent for a burger place not bad at all i have to say i wish i did get a burger for my friend order their bbqbacon burger and it was pretti delici im not a fan of bbq but this burger wasnt overpow with the bbq sauc the bbq tast was a good flavor that ad to the burger bacon and chees gave it a nice littl kick food was good staff was decent stay pretti busi on the weekend and the price are a littl high but you have to kind of expect that for they are right there in old town scottsdal old town seem to have littl higher price then other restaur down the street overal aok placei was super excit to check this place out when i saw the sign for a new restaur in mandalay shopp  rick moonen restaur dont disappoint and i was fire up for someth asid from fancyshman seafood  this place has a veri cool theme  i love the decor love love the uniform each server wear someth uniqu and the overal vibe

her the breakdown
th drink were veri invent and although not everi one we tri knock our sock off there were a few gems
12 star for a cool drink menu

food
chick pot pie nugget 355  there were great conceptu but a littl bland
french onion dip sandwich  15  the sandwich was veri bland and odd need salt or someth simpl to fix it  i was hope the au jus would do the trickbut even the au jus was bland 
fri oxtail  25  again great conceptbut unlik the french dip this was super salti  textur was great but it was way too salti to enjoy
mac and chees  75 if noth els you must go here for the mac and chees  realli delici  crunchi on top perfect creami perfect textur  yum
12 star for the mac and chees alon 12 for the creativ of the menu

service
ador hostess great outfits
th server waswel umnot amaz  we order drink and some appi and the appi arriv befor our drink  what  then dure the first round she ask if we want to order anyth els we said  were good for a few minutesand then she took the menus  what  we were a group of 4 peopl and had onli order two appi thus far  weird
so after a few minut we get anoth menu and again order drink and more appiesand again the food came first  so veri odd
th save grace was that the apprentic who serv our water was fab  we got all our food and drink recommend from her and would probabl go back just becaus she was so good
12 star for the servic  thank to the apprentice

on fun surprise
rick moonen stop by our tabl to ask how everyth was  that is awesom  the guy has a whole host of restaur in vega so i love that person touchof cours it was the second day they were open so it make sens  still i love that he took the time to make that impact
1 star for rick moonen

overall
thi is a new restaur  theyr clear still work out the kink  id go back on a date or someth if i was in the area  id like to give this place 6 month to figur thing out and then tri again  or at the least grab appi upstair and do dinner at rm seafood downstairmy friend were in town and after enjoy ourselv at michael jackson one we decid to find a place that was closebi for dinner i was stump until i rememb rx boiler room i have been to rm seafood a few time and my visit have alway been hit or miss so i wasnt sure what to expect 

mi friend has a five year old and our server was great about it she went out of her way to find my friend daughter a paper and pen to keep her busi we realli appreci everyth she did to accommod us servic was incred i would rate it 5 star for the service

a far as the food it was solid but noth amaz my mom and i decid to share the chicken pot pie nugget and osso bucco with orzo the nugget were good and moist but lack ani excit they had a good textur but i had hope for someth more the osso bucco was tasti and spici and the lamb was fall off the bone and tasti the dish had great kick i tri some of their mac n chees and it was cheesi and delicious

non of the food blew me away but it was solid and reason price for a strip restaur the restaur has a cool vibe although it was pretti empti when  we arriv on a monday around 830pm 

id come back again if i was in the area and need a quick bitei was realli excit when i heard there was go to be a new pizza restaur open up in aria  so i drop in to check out this new pizza joint at aria call five50 with a friend after work it is the second restaur open by chef shawn mcclain sage at aria so the expect of excel food was high

th five50 name seem strang but accord to them is the ideal temperatur for cook your pizza in the oven so is that fahrenheit or celsius and until just last week 550pm was the start of their happi hour and the promot was 50 cent beer  now hh is from 5pm to 550pm is it still consid a happi hour if it onli last 50 minut  550 might also be the start price of their pizza by the slice dont hold to it in case i am mistaken but it would fit the pattern of this gimmicki name 

the restaur is beauti design  it look great from the outsid although the vip area near the back and by that wall is just too cramp to be fulli functional

servic was friend and effici sinc the restaur is still new it also appear that they have way more staff on duti than are need  will be interest to see if the staf level will remain at current level in 23 month  

after look over the menu which is most a beverag menu the entir outsid cover of the menu is the wine beer etc menu while the insid menu consist of snack 5 item small plate your upscal appet salad pasta meat  chees and the 8 pizza select or you can custom your own

tri the forag pizza mushroom spinach rosemari whip ricotta and it was good the pizza crust was the star while the top were qualiti it was also  not exact generous  if i was hungri and didnt have a late lunch i can total finish this 16 pizza myself and not break a ayc sushi coma sweat  so it was not even a challeng to split it with anoth person

if i come back i will want to tri their gotham and truffl pizza  their small  plate and pasta item sound interest too which may actual be the more excit offer from chef shawn mcclain new pizza jointcraft beer sport bar

food  355  qualiti ingredi use on tasti flat bread pizza part of the overal tasti crunchi crust was sad burnt

creat  255  noth that i have not alreadi seen done somewher els  consid the talent of a chef that best an american iron chef i know this place has way more to offer in this depart 

pricevalu  35  casino price for the conveni of not have to walk or take a cab somewher els  if you want better valu for your dine dollar get a panini sandwich from jean philipp patisseri in aria and bellagio

servic 35  never had bad experi from ani of the wait staff at aria but waitstaff could be better train on what is offer on the menu  are breadstick complimentari if so we didnt get ani while we wait for the pizza

decor  355  hip upscal decor with dim light that fit the overal darker color scheme of aria not my style prefer but i just like the brighter more energet look of other interior decor execut vision more

aok and perfect for guest in aria and citycent complex

ne better hhmade reserv to dine here on new year eve so that we wouldnt get stuck in the cold on the strip for hour  surpris get into the hotel was no issu at all we were seat immedi and the place wasnt super crowd  becaus we had a group of 8 we sat at one of the long tall tabl which give you a good overal view of the entir restaurant

i have to admit we were a lil bit intox so we might have been slight obnoxi but our server was veri patient with us  i order the warm root veget salad with dress on the side bf had the farmstead pizza while everyon els at our tabl order other pizza to share i did have a coupl piec of my bfs pizza onli becaus i love egg and just see the yummi yolk run down the side of the slice made my mouth water 

the food was good not complet in awe of it especi with the price our bill just for my bf and i came up to abut 60 includ tip and one alcohol beverag everyon say it vega everyth is expens but honestlyfor pizza and salad but at least we had a good time and good experi would i go back again probabl notthis restaur close at 12 midnight nice place to grab a late night snack you can do dinein or just buy a slice from the counter 

nice bar area watch sport 

the servic the server is friend pizza do take a while to be serv that is okay but it is fresh made to order 

the food pizza has thin crust but not those crispi crust type can tast a littl bit wood burn at the end crust 

gotham  a littl bit way too salti for me lot of meat

margarita  not too sauci fresh basil leav on the top of the pizza

their cocktail drink almost 15isnt it great when a new buffet pop up  today i had the pleasur of tri this one for the first time accompani by robyn n  norm r  this place appear in the shell former occupi by crazi buffet 2 and they dont seem to have chang it much if at all except that it slight less expens  here were some other observ on this visit

th good

  nice dine room
  friend staff
  reason prices
  most food item proper identified
  proper light for both the food and the dine room
  big select of 111 food item plus sauc  dressings
  medium select of tasti sushi
  good mongolian style bbq with 4 meat  treat includ water chestnut bamboo etc


a few shortcomings

  it was too warm inside
  they didnt have quit all of the food out at 11 am open time
  their drink water had a snarki tast  it need filtering
  the sushi tabl didnt have separ tong for each item includ the meats
  the soft ice cream machin was out of order

they need to tighten thing up a littl here but overal i think it a nice place

her what i thought of this controversi new restaur after eat here today

y there were some negatives

  ive seen buffet with way over 100 item throw the door open to me their first custom ever and pull off a perfect present  china citi avondal  china oliv sun citi come to mind  this place has been open 3 month yet had first day problem such as not have the food out til 1130 when theyr suppos to be open  readi to go at 11  on top of that these guy are onli tri to put out 18 item  they need to chang the web site  the hour on the door if they want to open at 1130
 
  the rasam was greasi  onli lukewarm  same problem with this place 2 owner  name ago

  the sambhar was also onli lukewarm  otherwis it would have been veri good

  onli 18 food item is passabl for an indian buffet but not lot of empti tray where there should have been salad item or someth  empti tray are a nono at a buffet unless they are on a separ serv tabl way off from the other such as dure lunch hour at china town buffet in tempe

now i dont give onli 1 star to a busi unless it realli bad so it 2 for this one  were out of here right

wel yes but then again no because


  the staff was friendly

  the dine room is nice  has comfort seat includ wellplac booth  the room temperatur was right and the obligatori bollywood tv was turn low enough

  there were some tasti foods

th chicken fri rice indian style

th hot garlic naan brought to the table

th carrot  capsicum curry

th dal tapka


and some veri tasti food     

the butter chicken

th chicken curry

th bhindi masala

th mango custard

so we see that this place is a mix bag  difficult to rate  with a reason tuesday through thursday lunch buffet price of 795 i thought it was aok overal  they just need to tighten up their act as did bobbi at indian paradis in scottsdal where he whip his place up from 2 star to five after a littl feedback     not sure whi they have 5 star not sure whi they have 2 busi list with 2 differ address when there onli 1 tachi 

ive been come to tachi for year sinc this place is close to home the qualiti has declin over the year we would normal do ayc but they also have a regular menu to order from

miso soup
thi is not the version that made with love  the soup is premad and the tofu piec are so tini 15

sushisashimi
sashimi isnt includ in ayc ayc is about 2426person or you can get sushisashimi combo start at 10 the qualiti of fish is inconsist sometim the fish look like it was cut use a butter knife sometim the fish is icecold 255

shumai
you can get these ball fri or steam shumai is meant to be dip in soyponzu sauc but they dont give you sauc here 35

donburi
katsudon raw egg on top of rice with hot broth the hot broth cook the raw egg so mix it all up as soon as the bowl touch your tabl this is a good dish howev when my sister order this the last time it lack flavor they were not busi at all the last time we went so there no excus anoth inconsist 35

sinc the locat is conveni and sometim we just dont want to drive 10 mile to get good ayc i guess we will continu to come here and keep hope we catch them on a good daywe eye the margherita pizza and saw that onli 73 of them are made a day and sinc i onli like chees pizza it onli made sens to tri it perhap this is just me but i didnt find it delici you get this super thin crust pizza with a thin layer of tomato sauc and big blob of mozzarella chees the crust wasnt veri crispi the tomato sauc was just okay and the chees was just that  slight warm soft and mushi chees 


appar local get 20 discount wish we knew about it 


i might have to come back to tri someth els laterreserv for 6 made for a saturday night around 7pm  a last minut addit of two peopl was not communic to our reserv with thought that it wouldnt be a big deal to add two chair to a tabl  much to my supris it was made a veri big deal by the hostess in front of my guest to the point that my two ad guest almost walk out and went somewher els for dinner  it was communic that they could not accomod our two guest  on a side note it did look like the tabl were busi and there was anoth famili waitingso not over crowd  about 15 minut later we were awkward lead to a high tabl by the bar for a parti of 6  while we all stood around in amaz our group was kind argu who was go to stand to not inconveni the rest of the group  there were open chair all around us even though peopl were seat at the tabl  after 15 more minut of tri to shake off the weird unwelcom one of our guest ask a coupl behind us to use the chair they were not use  they kind offer them up with no problem and no help from the staff
 
first off i have never been treat like this at an establish  usual you accomod to see fit and we were more than fine wait for addit seat to come avail  i dont know what the disconnect or whi the hostess was so unaccomod but it was incred embarrass to the addit guest who were invit at the last minut not to mention me who invit them 
 
after the awkward wore off 30 plus minut and a coupl drink the rest of the experi was great  the food was fantast and just might be the best pizza that i have ever had

but wait   this is entir the best parti discreat email the manag about what had happen and i receiv no repli back  noth  not even an apolog which realli was all i was hope for and i had no intent to yelp the poor custom servic experi  even just an explani say that not how we run businessyada yadabut appar it is just how it is  sinc the unfortun silenc i felt the need to rate this place  custom servic is key not just good food  i may or may not be back but you can bet i wont be stand at a frickin tabl  what a bummerwe came here on a thursday even and order 
1 calamari fritti 13
 tradit or calabres style with calabres aioli and marinara dip sauc 
2 american  origin  downtown 20 
 mozzarella pepperoni molinari salami bacon sahhlot mushroom red onion bell pepper black oliv italian sausag cherri tomatoes
3 soda unlimit refil 3
for 7 use the live social deal  29 for 8 beer antipasti and pizza exclud ny22

 park is pretti lame we tri binion becaus they have free park with valid but they took out the valid next the cashier fail so there practic isnt anymor free park on the strip you gotta eat at their restaur or activ gambl 8 for 15hrs shiet
 got in around 9pm seat in a few minut sat in the back next to the bar right next to a speaker great place to have a scream conversation
 ran out of sicilian style dough just our luck just serv the last one 15 min ago i guess if we came earlier we wouldnt have had to deal with that problem we actual want to order the boss pizza instead becaus the crust is thicker with sicilian style im not much of a fan of the potato chip like pizza or should i say thin crust haha 
becaus we sat next to a speaker our server chelsei couldnt realli hear us over the music after sever ahem excus meesson of them got through and she hand us utensil and napkin after we got our antipasti who eat calamari with a fork and towel anyway haha come on nowanyway she was veri good at drink refil and attent thereaft 
 the calamari was great we got it half and half i recommend it bc after i ate a few spici i need to balanc it out with one regular spici one or calabres style tast better chelsei hook it up with dat extra dip doe haha need that for the extra dunker na mmm say lol 
 the downtown was fresh love the cherri tomato so red 6 slice didnt like the uncook onion peel off wood fire pizza nom 

break down of the live social deal
 so if you choos the most expens antipasti which is  the calamari at 13 and the most expens pizza romana at 35 get the beer 8 then technic you can get the save at 48 
 i probabl should have just save the deal for anoth day and just use the yelp checkin promo of 15 offyou know how outback steakhous has boomerang didgeridoo and foster poster on the wall and noth the least bit australian on the menu ive got news for you folk if you ever go to australia and ask for a bloomin onion theyll look at you like your crazy

th australian is the exact opposit there noth anywher in the place that would make me think they had anyth to do with australia and the place is definit a sport bar becaus there are tvs everywher so if your look for a place to catch a game i dont think youll go wrong here

i hear that theyr tri to get boag in here which would be awesomeeven better if they can get someth from cascad on my first visit i settl for a boomer lager4 for a big onec beat that 

their menu has a pictur of wagga wagga on the front my former boss was from wagga and have been to australia sever time i start to feel a bit nostalg in addit to your typic pub fare the menu has some actual aussi pub grub meat pie sausag roll and roo slider i had a sampler which consist of two sausag roll and a meat pie i enjoy it thorough serv with duck fat french fri it was too much food realli they also have lamington on the menu and tim tam for your sweet tooth 

if noth els i consid their menu a welcom departur from most other sport bar whose menus have littl to distinguish themselv from one anoth 

the patron are all a fun live crowd so i enjoy my first visit here i agre with some of the review that the servic is pretti lack the veri nice man who appear to be the bar manag did his best to fill in the gap so hat off to him but the rest of the staff seem to need more training

it seem like a lot of peopl are still smart and lament the demis of rtos this new venu is definit veri much a work in progress and they have a long way to go they need to do someth about the decor and realli add some down under atmospher and they need to train up their staff to be more attentive

that be said i hope that the australian pick up and becom someth it deserv a chanc just for offer someth differ the place has a lot of potenti and i think smooth over a lot of rough edg just might do the trick

i look forward to come back in the futur to a pack hous to watch some aussi rule footbal or rugbi while down someth from cascad pleasi like the concept of made to order pasta similar to other fast casual concept out there but they make their own pasta from scratch here the place just need more refin my first visit i got the food to go the hous salad 8 was alreadi dress so by the time i got home it was a wet soggi mess my wife took a singl bite and toss it  it was that bad have the dress on the side would be a huge improv but i dont think my wife care for the tast of it anyway i opt for their special  a roast pork loin 9 with a butternut squash pure saute veget ginger crumb and scallionging aioli the pork was a littl dri out but the flavor were good

on a second visit i tri the pesto 10  rigatoni pasta with pesto oliv garlic tomato pecorino and top with steak for an addit 175 the portion size was great and the housemad pesto sauc was good although there was way too much of it the pasta seem too thick and gummi 

it local own so id be happi to give them anoth shot but they do need to step up their gameif you can get pass a bit of a wait for your food includ appet then pasta fresh may be your type of restaur  i read the review prior to come here so i was well prepar for our food to take some time  howev i thought that the appet could have been quicker  

our eats
pan sear scallop 5 per order  you get one huge piec of scallop with this order i didnt think that this was enough for a group of three so i got two order  this app alon was worth the visit to pasta fresh the scallop was fresh tasti and on top of appl bit  to the side of this scallop was one cauliflow that had a kick to it  

garlic knot 350 for 5  the gf order this the garlic knot and i had a piec  this was fresh made and butteri  this wasnt over drench in garlic but still good enough for an appet 

lobster ravioli 18  this is new to pasta fresh and was my main dish  this dish was a disappoint first of all i thought that the ravioli was inconsist  some piec were too doughi some too hard and one tast overcook you get a decent amount of ravioli and in that mix you will find at least one good one  i did at least  now for my biggest issuewher the lobster  this entre is titl lobster ravioli and mix with mushroom  what i got was more of a mushroom ravioli that was mix with tini bit of lobster  you dont even tast the lobster becaus it that small  if you get this and wonder if there is even ani lobster in it it the tini white  red piec  rememb back in the day when you would find advertis for sea monkey all you had to do was mix this packag of sea monkey with your aquarium of fish  what your suppos to get is a famili of sea creatur chillin out with your pet fish i admit i was one of those kid that was order them and was disappoint when i could bare find a sea monkey that even got close to what they were advertis  well that my experi with pasta fresh lobster ravioli  i order what i thought would be a good portion of lobster meat and got noth but tini sea monkey size lobster in their ravioli

coupl other thing to point out
you get a free macaron with their yelp checkin but this was a total fail sinc they didnt have ani macaron  the pictur look good though 
there a secret menu  ask about it or check their not so secret onlin menu
again a bit of a wait
dont order the lobster ravioli
their creat your own pasta are inexpens and probabl worth the price  some of their entre are a littl steep especi if you get the lobster ravioli 

overal i still think i would come back  my friend order their chicken parmesan and it sure look good  he confirm it too  i also like the option to build your own pasta  their creat your own pasta have a ton of choic in pasta chees sauc and meat  i have learn my lessonno more lobster ravioli for me  i will tri one of their creat your own pasta next timeit a concept that make you wonder whi you didnt think of it first half bakeri half ice cream parlor put the two togeth and it almost as delight of a pair as mickey and minni mous or ginger rodger and fred astair or match game and hollywood squar or okay you get the picture

pick your ice cream stick it between two cooki and your on your way that basic it it not much more than that the cooki were tasti and im sure they werent old or anyth but they werent amaz and if your build your concept off of cooki and ice cream you kind of have to have amaz cooki that the whole point

i think the ice cream is thrifti which isnt baskinrobbin or coldston but that dont worri me none becaus i love thrifti ice cream just as much

th peopl there were realli friend and it seem as though theyr into communiti outreach which is alway a plus in my book ill probabl go back when i get the crave but i can also just do this at homeafter a day of black friday shop decid to take my wife out for a nice lunch and just happen to drive by and decid to give it a tri  first i prefer tabl servic vs order pay and wait remind me of a fast food restaur and not a great burger joint    zero stars

th burger onc it arriv was out of this world i had the primetim    three stars

th fri were cold and definit over season i had the truffl fri    zero stars

i realli want this place to be great    but i was left want so much more    i might be back but i would need to be in the area    not worth a separ tripi was excit to see a new sushi spot in henderson with great review i decid to pop in on a saturday to see what kind of lunch special were avail current yelp say this busi is close on weekend that is not correct they are open saturday but not sunday i was greet by my waitress and took a seat at the bar where the sushi chef welcom me 

i end up get the sushi lunch special 5 piec of sushi my choic of a spici tuna or california roll i went with the tuna and a bowl of miso soup i ask the sushi chef what sushi came with the lunch special and he said if i had specif fish i want hed tri to accommod me so i was abl to have some delici scallop 

mi miso soup came out first i was still warm from be out in the heat that morn so i didnt eat much of it as other review have mention this is made from scratch and you can realli tast the difference

i did not have a long wait for my sushi sad i was a tad disappoint right off the bat i had read anoth review explain that tokyo boy doe the spici tuna roll differ than other place with the spici sauc on top instead of mash the tuna and sauc togeth befor make the roll i am not sure if it is becaus it was part of the lunch special but my spici tuna roll was all mash up the tast was fine i was just expect to be serv the same spici tuna roll i saw in the other review photo my nigiri was good not blowyourmind amaz but good size cut of fair fresh fish and a good ricefish ratio 

hindsight is 2020 i probabl would have been happier if i order roll which it seem like most of the peopl rave about this place did i dont see myself rush back to tokyo boy but will probabl give them anoth tri eventulet me start off by say how sad i am that im not give this place 5 star becaus i realli want to do so been want to tri it so purchas the groupon  went there in between classes

th price could be compar to chipotl  zaba so i thought portion would be quit the same but i was wrong concept was the same but portion not so much order a bowl with rice  pulehu steak with most all the fixin salsa chees sour cream bean lettuc the fixin took over my bowl pretti much i had to dig through the mountain of top to even tri the steak oh how delici it was but i onli had about 6 or so good piec in it and my bowl lack rice my palm was bigger it was yummi though but i felt like i just order a big bowl of lettuc and salsa

mi food was not warm either my bf had the burrito and he said his was room temp mine was actual somewhat cold becaus of the amount of lettuc on it 

we also order chip and salsa all i know is that my chip were so stale and chewi and it was hard to bite into all for 5 sigh

bas i left my bowl of lettuc chees and salsa on the tabl a bit disappoint realli want to love this place im from hawaii  god know how excit i was to tri it thank good for the groupon though

il come back soon mayb it just today theyr realli friend  food tast good a coupl kink here  there but it has potenti so im look forward to tri it again for sure35 stars
cam here with a groupon walk in i was greet with a sampl of a coupl differ meat i was then show the menu board and explain the step of order i order a burrito made with a flour tortilla with pulehu steak chees jalapeno and spici tomato with grill maui onion the tomatoonion salsa wasnt spici but tast good i thought the steak was flavor and the whole burrito to be good but the size was too small for me i also order a chees quesadilla that was good but averag i could see myself come back here with coupon if ever offer my wife enjoy her food a bit more than me especi their coconut bark im not a fan of coconut i didnt tri itth peopl insid were friend and it was cleanthe coconut bark is wonderful
everyth els is chipotlestyl as other review have describ but with the 808 twist on it
i use my 20 groupon here for dinner for the bf and i and we still had to pay
i had the steak bowl with seawe rice black bean mild salsa and lettuc along with bottl water and a small order of coconut bark  i like the beef find it to be tasti and the combo of ingredi was veri hearty
mel had one side of the steak and one side of the chicken low carb day for him and a bottl of water
our order came to about 22
mi bowl of food was so big that i took half home becaus i had to leav room for the fame coconut bark which is wonder  did i alreadi say that  it is it remind me of almond roca which i love if i come back here im get that again  they also have holiday coconut bark for sale now which is made with white chocol  mahalodue to a recent incid at this restaur it was difficult to give an unbias overview sinc i person will not be patron this spot ani more but here a quick breakdown
food qualiti a
creat ba yes it a knockoff of chipotl but the food is amaz and the execut chef new handmad preservativefre sauc are phenomenal
cleanlinessqu of premis a
servicequ of staff minus the owner a

 i like the premis of this place keep it simpl use a present that peopl are use to but with an island flair and it work there setup is a lot like chipotl pick what style of food you want choos your meat or opt for vegetarian and then pick your side and i must say their huli huli chicken and their steak are good and their kalua pig is amaz and as mention abov their exec chef i forgot his name make greatcreat sauc regular and there a new one all the time 
            i was definit a fan of this spot and promot it to everybodi i knew 
what chang in short the owner and his attitudepassiveaggress demeanor what happen myself my gf and my brother went for dinner one night becaus i had been there 3 time prior and realli want them to tri it we get there order and everyth is cool now near everi time i had come here the sauc situat was differ the first two trip they had like one sauc per tabl a pikapepp sauc i think and the third time is when they roll out these handmad creation and each tabl seem to have one of each of the handmad sauc this particular time none of the tabl around us had ani sauc on them sinc the sauc were like 40 of whi i want to come back again i look around and notic a rack with sever bottl of each sauc i figur hey they switch it up each timemayb they put them on this one rack so they have to wast ingredi make a bottl of each sauc for each tabl so i go and grab them for our tabl cool a minut later anoth custom in the same predica went to grab sauc and was inform that those bottl on the rack were for sale and that there are bottl float around that say tabl on them for custom use of cours i and my group felt bad but right after the guy come over to the tabl and befor he said anyth we said we just heard you tell them and were so sorrywel pay for them it not a big deal theyr worth whatev the cost his respons so the wasnt big enough huh we apolog again as he was walk away he came right back with a purpl sharpi to right tabl on our bottl overt suggest that now he cant sell these and he has to use them for other custom we apolog again and he said with an obvious forc smile dont worri im the owner it my place i just want my custom to be happi we repli are you sure man he say whatev make you happi i had been apologet up to this point but now know that he was manag kind of tick me off he left again and then we look at this signi kid you notthat sign was in like 10 pt fontw were the closest tabl to the rack and couldnt read it from our tabl which btw is not onli bad for avoid peopl misus the bottl but also is a bad way to promot that your sauc are for sale as we were finish up he come back again with a new sign still in 10 pt font and put the sign on top of the bottl so nobodi can grab them without see it 
serious dude we mess up that was admit and we were will and abl to pay for it so as not to cheat an upandcom busi but your attitud and demeanor for be the owner make us not onli never want to come back but to warn the folk t o which we previous promot your biz if it was an employe that was rude fine id excus it but i cannot bring myself to support a place when the owner was direct rude here how it should have went down even if we didnt offer to pay for them you eat the cost of those bottl 21 be cool about it sinc it was a genuin mistak wait til we leav and then make whatev chang you need to instead you have to eat the cost of those bottl anyway but your passiveaggress manner has now lost my busi and other as well your staff was amaz and realli doe embodi the laid back and friend island spiritbut you on the other handne to learn how to embodi the mahalo vibe that you aim to promotwho those who are crave a hawaiian chipotle

when on sunday through wednesday they are open from 11am9pm on thursday they are open from 11am10pm on friday  saturday they are open from 11am11pm

wher locat in the plaza on  rainbow  sahara

what if you are crave chipotl but with differ ingredi you may like this place my friend and famili have been rave about this place for the longest time ever so i final decid to tri the socal hawaiian chipotl becaus i saw a groupon for it thank good for groupon

th dine area is decent size and may possibl allow about 20 peopl to sit and eat it is definit new and clean  

over excit as i am it is my turn to order the worker were total great and help ask if this was my first time at the restaur and they let me sampl their differ meat offer after tast test i got half huli huli chicken and half pulehu steak salad with seawe rice black bean grill pepper for an extra charg sour cream chees with their pineappl and also mango salsa there were also 2 differ type of dress as well and i chose to tri both the first was a papaya ranch which was a creami good the other saucedress was a tamarind base if i can rememb which also was good and tangy

for dessert i had to tri their famous coconut bark caramel brittl with chocol and coconut sprinkl on top it was a tad bit too sweet for me but it was definit offthehookkaba is one of those place ive been mean to tri and sinc they were one of the partner busi for we are one suppli drive for philippin so i want to go support all that were help gather up donat 

i got the udon curri with just egg and rakkyo overal the current was decent but there was a littl too much cumin flavor for me i do like it with the udon and while i went realli plain it stood up well alon the bf said his loco moco was okay mac salad was plenti and was well made i was still hungri though after eat i ate a full bahn mi after and got shave snow immedi after leav not good i could have order more here but the wait did not lead me to want to get dessert or extra side 

i understand with there be larg group there would be some wait but i just notic how it was not realli effici thing were come out one by one so i dont think they are do line procedur in assembl and expedit like at our tabl there was 3 loco moco and 2 curri udon you would think all the loco come out togeth the udon come out togeth etc

 the first moco was halfway done and the next two arriv a few minut apartthen my udon came and the bf ask about their side of macaroni the bf was at a few bite left of his moco befor the mac salad came after all the loco moco were eaten final christina got her udon which was cold but the gyoza was warmer so they probabl had it sit wait on the fri gyoza most peopl were say that one part of their meal was hot while the other was cold my egg was hot noodl warm this feel like a time issu a few peopl at my tabl who have been here befor have said food take a long time here even in their previous visits

curri is made in larg batch the side are made to order for it 90minut of a meal just seem a bit long for our 2 tabl plus a few peopl at the bar and one group of 3 in the restaur 

the waitress was nice enough 

it alright i think i prefer curri elsewher i did like the udon curri noodl but that is not a 1 hour 10 minut wait worthi food veri few thing for me isi see my yelp bud check into this place from time to time but i got to sayi wasnt too impress  so here we go

th gf and i came here to meet a few yelp peep and to drop off some donat at yosi  when we arriv our yelp bud were alreadi here and the place wasnt busi  one thing i immedi notic no one had food on their tabl i assum that they all order and were just wait for their food about 10 minut later one of the employe arriv at their tabl to final take their order say what  you know what that meant  that meant that it go to take about 15 minut or so for just our order to be taken  yes i was right but it was more like 20 minut  order their food is simpl you start at the top with your base then add to it with whatev they have to offer ie beef shrimp egg roll shrimp chicken etc and then add top of your choic  i got their loco kaba moco with chicken karaag and chicken katsu  i also use my free check in to have mushroom ad  i thought that food was just okay noth spectacular  i have to admit im not a curri fan  but kaba curri is pretti good  the karaag and katsu was averag  rememb i had mushroom ad  well they didnt they forgot the mushroom but at this point i didnt care sinc it was part of my free yelp check in 

but back to the servic when our food arriv they forgot to give me utensil  and you know me i need a fork for everyth  i eventu got my fork so i can chow down  my gurlpren food took a littl longer and when it final arriv they decid to be consist with their servic and fail to get her utensil too 

so overal my experi here was just okay i didnt have too mani issu with my food becaus i knew what to expect base on the price and what i was eat i was just a littl disappoint with the overal servic will i be back perhap mayb or mayb not   

ps  i turn into the hulk when im starv i go from hangri to angri and you wouldnt want to see me when im angri 


yelp person challeng 2013  491500oh tommi oh tommi you have let me down

i have been patient wait and wait for a tommi up on my side of town  i have been watch the countdown for the new store on craig to open for month now  i was so happi today when i saw on facebook you were final open  my heart was all aflutt and i couldnt get over there fast enough to grab a ridicul messi and oh so good chili chees burger and fri  and then it went downhill

first the locat itself is tuck into a corner of a big shop center  there are onli 3 park spot near the restaur  otherwis you have to park and walk across the entranc to the drive thru side which had a lot of cross traffic  peopl were drive all sort of crazi in this area so be care walk around here sinc there realli isnt a clear path to walk on

i actual had to do drive thru today becaus my kiddo had fallen asleep on the way over  it is easi to get into the drive thru but realli tricki onc you have pick up your food  the driveway is veri narrow and quit close to the build  i drive a midsiz sedan and it was tight  i feel bad for anyon is a big suv or full size truck  pay attent or you might hit the wall

next the order taker  she was realli quit friend but was on the pushi side  i need a second to review the board to know what to order for my daughter to eat later  i ask to have a minut to check the board  i think i got mayb 15 second befor she was ask if i was readi to order yet  there wasnt a line so i am not sure whi she was in such a rush  

i went ahead and order and then she ask if i want to upsiz my drink for an extra 50  i said veri clear no thank to which she said ok  i assum that meant i would get a regular size drink silli me  i get up to the window and she hand me a larg soda which i was total charg for so it wasnt just a mistak by whoever was serv up the soda  i told her i said a regular and she said she thought i said to upsiz it  i wasnt in the mood to argu so i just took the drink  i mean i love soda and can easi drink 2 liter in no time but i am tri to be good and cut back on my soda addict  so much for that  it was just fishi in my opinion  i dont know if the girl realli made a mistak or want to improv her upsel total  so watch out for that trap

next was my burger order  i order a regular chili chees burger  i specif ask to have no onion becaus they are yucki  the girl told me that they onli put onion on burger if you request them  i said great and to pleas keep them off of my burger  so you can imagin my surpris when i got home have been drool over the burger next to me for the last 3 mile and then took a big bite into my burger that was cover with onion  ugh  i have never seen so mani onion it was almost like i got an extra help of them  fun time for sure

so after i took a bite into my onion infest burger i had to take a big swig of my giant soda to wash the onion down  guess what  the soda mix was total off  i mean the place had been open for 25 hour by the time i was there  how was the soda to syrup mix alreadi goof up  so yes i paid extra for gross soda  

on the posit side the burger was super tasti onc i pick all of the onion off and smother in delici tommi chili and chees  the fri were simpli amaz i have no shame so i scrap all of the extra chili chees off of the paper they were wrap in yummmm chees paper if you havent tri a tommi burger you realli need too

i still love tommi even after all of the mess list abov  i am give this locat the benefit of the doubt and give them 3 star  it is their open day so mayb everyon is work out the kinklet me start by say that if your look for a henderson locat to read or do schoolhom work or comput work  this is the place  it a big locat with lot of vari seat both indoor and outdoor and both loung and busi  it even got a long wooden stool bar with lighten and plug in for laptop  it perfect for a casual meet or a librari substitute

that said the servic in this locat is some of the worst ive seen in the brand  everi time ive come by ive had to repeat myself multipl time ive gotten short comment from the staff and ive been oft ignor for the appar more import drive thru  

ive watch the staff bicker and argu with each other right in front of me  ive had one of the staff member dust the light direct abov myself and everyon els  and our open coffe while also ignor crumb dirt and grime all over the tabl and chair around us  ive watch staff whip trash bag around emphat  dust up air and who know what els all in the name of appar cleanli  and most of all and most import i dont feel like ani of the staff member could care less who is there

starbuck isnt my favorit place  but they general tri their best to make you feel welcom into their corpor coffe paradis  and i sort of came to expect that  i didnt find it herethe tamal are delici and perfect season the owner was the person who greet me on this visit she was realli sweet and offer sampl of the tamal she make from scratch a famili recip hand down 4 generat  i end up get an order of beef and chicken tamal also the owner threw in some bean tamal for us to tri  the order packag in foil and came with two littl cup of green salsa in the bag when i got home it was still steami hot when i unwrap the corn husk the beef tamal are the one to go for chicken one were good but just a tad dri and not as flavor to my tast bud then again im not a big fan of white meat anyways
  
this place is strict a takeout joint there is no seat or dine area avail that a drawback for me sinc i like dine out their menu doe indic they do deliv so plus point for tamal home deliveri and as other review indic the tamal are small i dont know how it would go over with peopl who have bigger appetit than i do especi if you are plan to have it as a meal the portion size do make perfect appet or a satifsi light snack though  price point wise it is afford under 10 buck but mr b comment and i agre that the fast food mexi place in the area are cheaper and you get more portion wise for your money
 
despit those minor issu i would keep this place in mind these tamal are good i take meal made in housemad from scratch over the frozen process fast food place ani day  dont let the star rate deter you away from here more power to young women like this owner who have the cajon to open a small busi in this tough economidid not know this place was here actual ran into one of the worker pick up some ingredi at mekong market and he ask me to come check them out who doesnt like a tasti bowl of number one to get the blood moving

loc in a tini strip mall with a serious no frill set and decor insid is larg and veri basic with sever tabl to enjoy your meal each tabl come with all the standard vietnames sauc or condiment nice

been here a few time and normal go with one of their soup and mayb an appet the menu here is rather larg with a good varieti of differ item alway see a lot of the local vietnames foodi come in and chow down on some of their favorites

usu get here earli for lunch on mani occas the place look like it was not clean the night befor or mayb after the morn crowd and sever tabl are still not readi or set up for servic hmmm

food is rather good and the price cannot be beat just tri and pretend you are on a top secret mission and mayb give them a chanc to clean up befor you get there it can be hard to enjoy your meal when there is a vibe of panic in the air with them tri to get the place ready

definit recommend check them out servic is probabl the area they should focus on to improv the overal eat experi aok and then some

35 stari dont understand the hype 

i never visit a whole food until i move to phoenix this store was my first whole food experi peopl go cuckoo for this place particular my ladi she love this ef place whi that an actual question becaus i dont get it 

weve come here for

hot food  ive tri a lemon chicken chines bowl okay anoth time i made a pay by the pound dinner with brussel sprout mac and chees chicken and lentil rice the brussel sprout were good the rest were just okay it can get pricey when pay by the pound too 

groceri  some cool stuff but i dont think there was anyth that i couldnt get elsewher 

bakeri thing  ive had two slice of cake from the bakeri and didnt like either of them

beer and wine  they have a decent select i like how they had the rate beer rate post for some of the brew 

they have a juic bar is that what it call this area where they defil fruit and veggi on one of our visit my ladi had them make her one of those nasti look ground up veget drink shudder if that your thing more power to you but ill take my fruit and veggi unsquish pleas see this spectacl gross me out everi time  

mi assess i can get pretti much everyth they offer at whole food from other place for less money am i miss someth 

hey the emperor isnt wear clothcame here for dinner the insid was clean but they seem to have a few kink to work out one of the employe brought a menu and explain some of the food the soda fountain wasnt work and i wasnt go to pay 125 for a bottl of water so the food was pack for take out instead of eat insid the woman who took the order said they were have some issu get the man out to hook up the machin she also said they had a lot of delay in even open at all she seem nice enough and appear to mean well like i said they just have some kink to work out

mi wife purchas a yelp deal 10 for 20 and even though they chang the deal to 5 for 10 they honor what was purchas the tortilla here are weird the textur and tast remind me of the shell they use on gordita at taco bell it wasnt dri or anyth but i didnt care for it i like a more tradit tortilla the quesadilla wasnt veri good it was a tad overcook and the chees was funki the rice has a good tast kind of like they mayb cook it with chicken stock it was good the bean had a good flavor but not in the bean and chees burrito i think it goe back to the tortilla here im not find of i had a sizzl taco and realli like it it was differ and the taco shell was great we share a big white fluffi sweet thing for dessert the name i dont rememb but it was damn good it remind me of someth i would eat at a carniv or some sort of fri bread i wouldnt drive far to eat here but when in the neighborhood i would stop by for sizzl tacoitem selected

loc all the way up in centenni and tuck away in a small busi park it was a serendipit mention by a colleagu brows restaurantcom that lead me through the door of divin eateri just after seven on a bright saturday morn my entri met by an empti dine room and warm welcom from the lone cook and singl server  not exact the sort of place one stumbl upon but warm and cheeri with local art avail for purchas on the wall the menu of divin eateri is divid into breakfastlunch section for those arriv from 7a2p with dinner commenc at five oclock and with both stapl and novelti avail my order veer toward breakfast  a three part order mistaken turn into four when my server seem read my mind and order dessert for me even though id not request it  surpris soon to swell in patronag as the clock struck 730 and reach perhap 23 capac by eight it was with sever cup of seattl font coffe and the restaur 80s soundtrack that i pass time until my breakfast arriv and cite divin reluct to stock artifici sweeten to focus on natur unprocess food i have to say i was a bit let down as all option arriv with artifici mapl syrup while the 5 red velvet shortstack tast not onli process but chalki as well  turn my attent to the item that work both the scratch made buttermilk biscuit and crispi french toast serv as a sort of crust to a top of pecan pie prove remark while my freebi dessert  not at all natur or unprocess  was exact what youd expect the strawberri jus sop up into the light batter of the twinki rous thought of the pend summer and shortcakill just come out and say it i do not love snowflak product

i it as good as it get compar to kuma snow cream it night and day snowflak textur is much better they use all natur flavor they probabl are as good as it get in this realm am i a fan i say yes how could you not love these guy but the actual product im afraid i have to go with aok

iv tri them twiceonc when they were a trailer in hendertucki and onc at their new locat in chinatown both time i came away extrem impress and yet somewhat disappoint there just someth miss when that perfect shave cream float over your tongu it like it forget to let your tast bud know that they are experienc flavor

 figur out that i prefer my dessert to be much more creami art of flavor anyon or juici and refresh art of flavor anyon to achiev this at snowflak i have to let the cream melt in my mouth but even then the flavor is veri light this is help by generous amount of condens milk but that seem to defeat the basic idea

so there you have it i simultan give them 3 4 and 5 star i thought about averag out with a 4 but i have to go with how i realli feel

3 staritem selected
black seasam snow mochi condens milk egg pudding
green tea snow red bean condens milk

origin intrigu but inevit underwhelm by the froyo fad it was with high expect that i approach the high prais snowflak shaveri hope that the new foodi trend of japanes snow cream would succeed where other had fail name creat a reason to ever crave it in a world full of gelato and ice cream  locat like mani wonder thing on spring mountain road in the same complex as kabuto raku monta zen and other it was just after 500 when i enter the small shop and greet by friend server and low price i opt for two small cool combo and with the allnatur snow shave and top i made my toward the door to indulg the delic ribbon slowli shift as i walk and the first fluffi bite cross my lip just as i step outsid the flavor quit subtl and decid improv by the accoutr particular the egg pud which i would glad eat by the bowl top with or without a scoop of red bean  admit a fan of sweet decad dessert and perhap expect too much base on the public i will simpli say that while i appreci snowflak ethic and ingredi im just not their target market  if i want health food ill stay home and eat as i alway do and if i want frozen dessert ill head over to art of flavora strong 3 star imho

i saw a tip recent that they do a great california roll herelolwel they do more than that  there are onli a few incred thing i find here these day under the new owner and staff but there is still a lot they are do right here

a i see it there are two reason to come here uni  ayc  they dont serv ani disappoint here  just about everyth is a littl abov averag so with ayc you get a lot of good food at a solid price 2627 i think  but outsid of the uni there is noth here worth call out specif in my book  one of the better spot in the immedi area but not a place i go out of my to get tothis sushimon is in my hood and recent was purchas by the mon group should be awesom right sinc goyemon is the businesssssss a decreas in the hour wait time some delici grill pork belli and various other delici appetizers

to echo jen s this is a goyemonlit they have some of the same appet some of the same special and some of the same dessert they also probabl have the same qualiti fish assum it the same supplier but it definit not the same here the fish cut are weird the assembl of the sushi is differ and the rice is cool when i say cool i dont mean cool like the button your gonna hit after read my review but cool temperatur perhap they dont have the same rice warmer as goyemon but to eat cold uni and cold rice blehhhhh

bett than some ayc place but i will be continu my travel to goyemon landit is with great sad that i have to give them 3 star but i have to stick to my gun and rate the restaur base on food  

i am passion about tonkatsu  pleasedont confus this with tonkotsu as in monta ramen  ton mean pig  katsu is someth fri with panko  kotsu is bone as in pork bone broth you make ramen out of so pleas get it straight  katsu not kotsu  

when i was in japan this spring i must have had 3 or 4 tonkatsu meal  tonkatsu restaur are ubiquit there not quit as mani as ramen yas or 7 11s but you wont have ani difficulti find one when you are in the mood for it tonkatsu is a veri narrow nich they onli serv fri pork loin rosu katsu pork filet hile katsu and some place may serv fri prawn and such but that usual about it  most place do fri oyster from fall to spring  tonkatsu restaur are somewhat differ from other genr like sushi or ramen becaus peopl dontcant make nigiri sushi or ramen from scratch at home but tokatsu is not veri difficult to cook at home  then how come tonkatsu restaur are so popular  wellit becaus they tend to be cheap and it a mess to make at home with deep fri and all but the most import factor is that somehowit tast so much better when the pros do it  it just pork saltpepp egg flour and panko deep fri but i just cant make them like they do in tokatsu restaur that whi i go out to wako saboten maisen etc with their softcrispi fri panko layer but when you sink your teeth into it it ooz with all that nice pork fat juic that whi  somehow it doesnt turn out like that at home

a i have been say for year that vega need a tonkatsu place i was ecstat to hear that kiyoshi open  it in the se corner of jone and robindal and it is a cozi clean place with great friend servic  

the menu was a bit busier than i like but seem legit and there was rosu katsu as i want  you go to tonkatsu place you get rosu katsu  tonkatsu restaur live or die with rosu katsu  

each tabl has a sesam grinder and a pot of tonkatsu sauc  you grind as much sesam you want and add a tonkatsu sauc to make your sesam flavor sauc  

rosu katsu set look authent and promis  what didntwa the katsu itself  it look a littl too brown dri and the outer panko layer has separ from the meat and fell apart as it was pick up  it tast dri and i could not enjoy ani of the juici pork fat as i bit into it  it like go to a ramen place and have a broth that was tasteless with floppi overcook noodl  

as i mention earlier it not hard to cook your own tonkatsu  in order for me to go and pay money for it it has to be better much better than what i can make at home and this wasnt the case  im hope that perhap mine was a flop  but the appeal of eat porktonkatsu is in the fat and this particular rosu katsu was not fattyjuici enough partial due to overcook  i would high recommend them to keep on work at it until when cut into katsu a nice juici pork fat flow out and that meat is ever so slighlti pink  in japan they use mukin pork where there is no concern for parasit so some tonkatsu place serv their katsu pretti pinkish  do so in the us probabl wont fli but it certain doe not need to be overcook as they did

thi place has potenti but they need some work on their katsu perhap a lot more than some   i will visit again and hope to see someth that doesnt shame their exist as a tonkatsuya  until thenil keep cook tonkatsu at homefirst off we are huge fan of citizen public hous and veri much foodi so we were veri excit to tri the glad unfortun for the most part we were disappoint not with the servic or the trendi atmospher it was the food and we tri a lot of it with multipl recommend from the waiter 

1 fondu 2 out of 5 star chees was a 10 but the accoutr was just meh esp the smoke pork butt which should have been the star it was basic process canadian bacon cube up 
2 pecan smoke grill veget 1 out of 5 star weird rutabaga parsnip and babi carrot with some weird chick pea pancak was suppos to have manchego chees on it but no dice not sure it would have help 
3 octopus salad 2 out of 5 star octopus was good but the overal flavor profil was way too aggress from the peppercorn to the bitter grapefruit no beuno we should have stuck to the chop salad but stupid us for tri someth new 
4 the pigstrami 5 out of 5 star the sandwich is bomb the pastrami is think cut tender some of the best ive ever had great chees rye bread and housemad ketchup for the fri id come back for this 

good beer select good drink but much better food at cph if you go and check out the glad steer clear of the miss outlin abovthe concept of this place is uniqu in vega basic youv all heard it boba girl serv you drink in their lingeri 

their servic is impecc the girl are alway smile and friend ive been here 3 time and the servic has been consist great they have board game to play the girl sit down with you and chat as well as play board game with you 

so whi the three star you ask honest i realli want to like this place becaus the peopl here are realli kind and it not like a typic boba shop i came for boba and it just too overwhelm on sweet and the price is way too expens for a littl serv of tea

th first time i went i order a boba milk tea way too powderi and left a weird after tast in my mouth i alway compar milk tea to the one ive had in hong kong and it just felt like powder that wasnt fulli blend into the water the second time i order a flavor black tea i cant rememb if it was mango or passion fruit i just rememb someth fruiti the tea tast is pretti good but i just cant handl all that sugar id suggest go for black tea if you dont like it too sweet the latest time i went i order a kumquat black tea the tea was just too sweet onc again i expect it to be over sour becaus it is a kumquat after all but onc again i am have troubl with how sweet it is 

i still come here becaus the servic is good and to take first timer that want to go but it realli pain on the belli to suffer all that sugar 

dont be discourag id recommend check it out at least onc if you like servic sweet drink and girl then you wouldnt have a problem here but if you want the tea i wouldnt come here for itabov averag powderbas drink at an abov averag price

caf teaz is hidden away on the backsid of the thai place in an asian strip mall 2nd floor they are a vietnames coffe shop eg cafe that serv food and drink with waitress in linger ive been to coffe shop like this befor but they were ghetto and full of smoke cafe teaz is modern and clean and appar get pack later on at night the ladi themselv were not at tip top physici condit as those you may find in la

th drinks
i came here becaus the drink sound good they are powder base but surpris i love the hot taro milk tea with boba ask for half sweet the pot milk tea was pretti good but small and expens it milk tea top with whip cream and chocol cooki crumbl total for two came out to 12 yike your pay for the novelti of the mason jar and glass and the fact that you can talk to ladi in their lingeri 

they also have a small select of hot foodssnacks

for the boba lover it pretti standard i would probabl opt base on size valu and qualiti to go elsewheri came here for two reason 1 as a great addit to the coffe tour of phoenix and 2 becaus i had time to kill in scottsdal i realli didnt think it was anyth special sorri guy i know they roast their own coffe which is nice but the coffe was veri ordinari it was fine but noth spectacular addit they have onli one size of coffe in mug i want 16 oz but could onli get 12 unless i want a togo cup odd the atmospher was fine and the owner possibl said they have karaok which is kind of neat seat insid is a littl limit but i easili got a spot at the window bar if i were in the neighborhood i would consid go back but i think press is a better choic for the area and sever downtown coffe bar would beat it hand down anyway it was ok but i wont be rush backi wasnt as impress as everyon elsemayb becaus i went later in the day i will tri them out again earlier in the day though and updat so we got a sugar cinnamon crunch appl fill cinnamon crunch chocol dip buttermilk bar french cruller and cream fill cronut 
the woman at the counter was friend price on par with most good donut joints
sh threw in a few glaze donut holes
th sugar donut was the best of what i got soft and yummi the buttermilk bar was gross not too mani place know how to make a good light and airi french crullerthey are the closest to what i look for not too shabbi the rest of the donut were just averag ive had better cronut  elsewher as well
i would stop by pinkbox befor i came here again sinc they are so close in proxim but i will give it anoth tri at some pointi realli like the layout of this new starbuck and the build is pretti cool too  normal the servic at starbuck are pretti great  but this time around we did not have a realli good experi  the guy that check us out were nice and friend  when we were wait to pick up our coffe we wait more than 10 minut and we onli had a coupl of peopl ahead of us  also they make my mom coffe wrong  

sinc i realli like starbuck i will give this store anoth shotwent for lunch last week and was veri impress with the servic we tire the guacamol and it was wonder full of tomato onion cilantro and lime juic 

i had the tri tip burrito and also tri the green chili pork while both were good unfortun the amount of salt was so overpow i could bare eat them 

hope that was just an off day becaus the place itself is great love the decor and the server rock i will still tri it again and hope the salt level lessen 

the other complaint is the amount of time it took to get our bill i think we wait about 20 minut they need to keep in mind a lot of peopl in the area are on the lunch hour so be time is importyelper descend on ong gie feel all readi and rare to have some barbecu fun i howev be of the school of thought that one goe out for dinner to avoid cook opt not to join my tablem in the barbecu line of thing but instead went for the fri chicken in sweet chilli sauc which had a realli great korean sound name on the menu but which in retrospect and when i write it out like that sound devast plebeian

a it happen i think i might have made a mistak sinc im told that the barbecu was realli quit marvel and there were lot of colour involv which is normal a good sign my chicken tast love but was rather tough go with veri chewi batter if i hadnt order a side of rice then it would have becom monoton veri quick as the veget flavour were drown out by the sauc not that it wasnt veri tasti but it was just all a bit heavi and glutenous

i was a bit alarm by the safeti of the barbecu setup i alway laugh at sign that say caution hot on obvious hot thing but the notic absenc of warn on the open skillet set into the tabl was surpris in addit the hotplat ran off main power which meant that the cabl trail under the tabl and swung peril a few inch off the ground like a tripwir between the tabl and the wallsocket which the peopl sit on the other side of the tabl had to be care to notic and avoid when get in and out

fin when i buy a soft drink for a consider markup in a restaur it alway easier to push the usual markup out of my mind if it not serv as id find it in were i to buy it from a shop the plastic bottl sit on the tabl didnt seem to fit with the love restaur vibe of the place

that said the staff were stellar one veri cheer and help young woman came over to explain the barbecu process to my slight mystifi friend and when one person main was forgotten a senior member of staff came over in person to apologis oh and also the menus are trim with super shini shini golden cord which was delight distract and i want to take one home with me

so to sum up ong gie has a love atmospher and the even as a whole was veri enjoy and though im not sure id necessarili be in ani undu hurri to return i would certain not object to the idea eitherthis place need some improv and im not gonna be too harsh on them sinc they are new and are probabl still get a hang of things

when i first walk in i was the onli custom in line there was a cashier and a manag probabl owner at the regist do some cash handlingdraw type stuff for about a good 2 minut it seem without acknowledg my presenc i understand they were total focus on do their cash handl busi but a quick hello well be with you in a moment would have been appreci it was nye so i didnt get upset becaus i didnt want no trick to be killin my vibe i just kinda let it go and brows the menu while they count their drawer 

when they were final done the friend cashier took my order and while i was get my drink i wit a gentleman pick up his to go order the girl repeat his order and i heard him say it was suppos to be no tomato and i just watch the girl just say oh sorrri there was a paus for a moment then she say your total come to the guy just pay and walk away figur it just a lost caus mayb he didnt want his vibe kill either and just didnt want to bother

upon select my tabl i was default to the least dirtiest one the one that was closest to the bathroom that had a ting of sewag smell mix with air freshen all the tabl were dirti and the trash can were full with trash hang on the side but none of the employe came out to clean until i was alreadi done eat and it was not busi there was definit some down time for someon to have check the dine room you got time to lean you got time to clean

okay now on to the good i order the pastrami burger which came out super juici and cook just right the pastrami slice were not too thickwhich i hate i prefer thinner cut of pastrami when it sit on my burger and this was perfect for me the juic were run down the wrapper and my forearm which to me is alway a good thing get your extra napkin by the condiment station i have to say it is the best pastrami burger ive had in vegas

th worker were all veri friend but they definit need to improv on the cleanli of the restaur i realli do hope they stay around long becaus it will be my go to place for when im crave a thick juici burger i like the fact that it also less than 5 minut from my hous i dont realli know if that a good thing though  so bottom line 5 star for the pastrami burger and 1 star for cleanli of the restaur i hope that next time i visit these thing will have improv becaus if not it definit go to kill my vibethis is a review ill probabl come back to updat if i ever take the chanc to tri this place again whi  a littl stori first

fourteen or so yelper organ by lj end up tri out soho in a uye i was excit to tri this place as there was a decent amount of veri posit review and also it was liter one minut and thirti second from my house

w were seat prompt and it was great that they could accommod a larg parti on relat short notice

unfortun our server was quit insist that he decid the menu for us while some peopl were open to the idea i dont think it work out for our group i tri to voic that some of us arent realli interest in a full tast menu and would rather order some item that we had read about instead of listen care he kind of brush it off say well if there someth you want to tri ill incorpor it a lot of the posit review laud the place for the friend servic and good price but i wasnt abl to experi this honest when someon has a tast menu somewher we get to see price of the item be brought out as well as a lineup of item i didnt want to insist becaus i was afraid of ruin the experi for other as well as not want to speak for other but honest i felt corner by our server

so out came item after item wagyu this rib that tostada this shrimp that some were okay some were great and some were complet pass i was have a good time though the food wasnt as excit becaus well i didnt realli choos nor was i abl to anticip anyth have not even seen a list of what would be serv as mani have said befor the most appet dish for me end up be the rib though have to split it among the tabl made it so i didnt get a lot of what i realli want the other that i found tasti were cod lettuc cup the 

in the end our bill came out and we actual end the meal a littl earli becaus i dont think most peopl were prepar to spend a lot here it still came out to 36 dollar a person and it didnt seem as if most of our group was particular happi with how they handl it it was a singl check with item after item and autograt  so there no incent for the server to do anyth but throw item at us and it not exact like they brought out someth made special for us i even went home and ate after the meal

a a side note one of the busser spill a plate full of wagyu sauc on the back of one of the ladi at the tabl and didnt even notic until we said someth while it cant be total blame on the busser as it was certain unintent it was just anoth thing that made the night less spectacular than it should have been

im definit will to tri soho again and hope i will get to choos what i eat next time i would like to thank lj though for set up the eventpark 35
i went to soho for a yelp  uye event it locat on jone coupl block south of  215 locat is easi to find but park might be an issu on busi night 

atmospher 45
averag nois level veri compar to other sushi or ayc restaur good for a larg gather etc

servic 35
this place was veri accommod with 1520 peopl all though it could be becaus they knew that we were with yelp it seem like that their staff was not the most attent or train one of the waitress actual manag to pour left over sauc over  one the my friend dress which was an accid but that just show that they need to improv their service

food 35
food was way better than their servic restaur actual made a tast menu for everyon at the tabl here is what we had

sear tuna with tempura jalapeno it will be spici sear tuna was fresh but i am not sure if jalapeno go well with it also there was lot of ponzu sauce

potstick meh i would say avoid it you do not go to restaur like this for their potstick they didnt seem fresh and it seem like they were ad them to our tast menus caus they had bunch sit around in the freezer

sear yellowtail the fish was fresh and it was sear to perfect amount unlik the tuna they didnt over do it with sauc present was good to

oyst they were not good i do not like oyster drench with sauc special when it  sweet and sour oyster are enjoy with light lemon juic that it 

shortrib pièc de résistanc of the meal you will see lot of review mention this and that is with the best reason it the main highlight of this restaur and they know it 20 for a rib the meat fall of the bone and it practic dissolv in your mouth the tast is exquisit some short rib did have a lot of fat on it but it up to person prefer some peopl prefer the flavor that fat add to a meal i person dont enjoy it becaus it will add anoth mile of run to my daili cardio 

over all this restaur is not bad for the locat it in but if you have a choic of go to other place then i would high recommend pick someth els the shortrib is the main attract but it not fulli worth the price when you get a shortrib full of fat and less meat also servic need a bit of a work

averag 355  be a man of scienc i round it down to 35 so other or i strive for more perfect dcame here for a quick cheap lunch with el novio purchas the groupon and in we went there was no one to greet us and there was no one in the dine room so we went into the bar and were told by the bartend to sit wherev we want decid on a comfi booth in the bar area and then short after a server brought over some menus 

after order our food we decid on some happi hour drank the server told us the groupon can not be use on happi hour which is the same as everywher els but most place will just open a separ check for you not here that was fine though becaus i just made by man go to the bar and get our drink there lol how can you pass up 1 bud light and 2 margarita 
i got the shred baracoa salad which come in a taco shell and is realli delici lot of fresh avocado and they dont use cheap lettuce
boyfriend got the 3 plate combo with carn asada taco beef taquito chicken enchilada rice  bean this was just ok 
chip salsa  bean dip were good we were not offer a refil 

the servic from the server was alright she did her job and noth more although to make her life easier they should probabl assign 1 room for seat so that she doesnt have to run through 3 separ dine area the femal bartend was nice though mto cafe just open at 100pm on oct 22nd so the time of the 1st three review are a littl suspici the cafe is on the smaller side but well design and welcom i order the skuna bay salmon wrap which was not what i expect the wrap had egg in it which were not list in the descript and i do not like salmon and egg cook togeth i was expect someth more like a wrap version of lox and bagel asid from that fact i think other peopl would like this combin for a 12 wrap i would have expect it to includ chip or fri but it didnt so i also order a side of fri which where unseason and floppi 

overal it nice to have anoth dine option downtown but i think mto cafe is a littl on the pricey side for breakfast and lunch offer it will be interest to see how they do over timecrumb everywher that the stori of my lunch i was crave banh mi and sinc im a big fan of the mr sandwich on spring mountain i was happi to have a locat open up on the east side came here around lunch time and they were pretti busi most peopl order pho on this cold day but i was in a rush and just order the charbroil pork banh mi and a taro milk tea with boba 

the sandwich was just ok the bread was way too crumbl and made a mess everi time i took a bite which was annoy tast slight stale as well which was disappoint the meat and veggi were ok wish they were a littl more pickl to add more flavor but still ok 

the milk tea was good and basic would have been a littl better if they ad more ice but i enjoy it

overal i dont see myself go out of my way to come here but it a good addit to the areaour neighbor use to run lao thai the restaur that use to be here they had one of the best asian fish dish in the valley now this new place bei is here and im think when did this happen 

i was veri skeptic at first especi when i saw so mani yelp review with 5 star most from peopl with 1 friend1 review or 66 friends0 review i appreci elit review for the most part and there werent mani 

anyway it was late and we didnt want a sit down dinner so i stop by for a takeout order the place was quit full on the wednesday befor thanksgiv the staff greet me with open armsveri friend i was given a full menu and a sushi menu the sushi menu is larg and even has sashimi i order a salmon and tuna sashimi i thought both were veri goodnic big cut fresh and veri smooth on the palat 

also order a seafood udon soup dish although the portion was larg and overflow with those delici noodl they were way skimpi on the seafood one mussel 2 shrimp and about 5 babi scallop for 10 buck i expect a bit more seafood becaus i know udon noodl are cheap this brought the star to 3 unfortunately

th rest of their menu look good and appar they have a great happi hour when we go for a sit down and tri someth els mayb i too will be on of the multipl 5 star reviewwent to the perch with a buddi of mine yesterday for beer and lunch 

the good
they have an extens beer list with some realli great beer i was a fan of the strawberri beer and the grapefruit slam ipa order the black bean patti salad and it was veri tasti and enjoy went up to the top of the restaur and there is a great loung area that was awesom to sit at in the great weather the environ of the restaur was veri nice they have bird in cage and it almost look like a patio but in a good way i enjoy what was around me while eat 

the bad
th servic was terribl my buddi got his beer first and mine took so long to get that i liter forgot i order it no joke our salad came veri slowli too even the waitress approach us at one point ask where are your salad to which i repli good question we all had a laugh and i wasnt tri to be rude but it realli was take too long for a salad it also took just as long to get our check and the waitress mix up our bill multipl time becaus of this when i got home i came to find out that she had charg my card for my lunch and my buddi i call the restaur back and gave them my informationth general manag was who i spoke with and he apolog and told me he cancel the extra charg of cours this happen on a saturday so i am still wait to see if it will in fact cancel or fall off my account come tomorrow as of right now im down 30 dollar that i should have veri irrit about this 

all in all if it wasnt for the servic and the bill mix up i would have given it a much higher rate i will go back in hope that this was a one time fluke and hope will have a better experi next time guess well see35

the first time we came here the servic was soooooooooooooo slow and the server was a bit awkward we order a bunch of thing and noth stood out and the sashimi was not that fresh

fast forward to my most recent visit the servic improv tremend food came out at a good pace and the same server was on her a game i tri the uni trio which was 15 and well worth it come with uni sashimi uni potstick and uni hand roll the uni was fresh and i thought it was super creativ to put it in potstick form

mi onli gripe with this place would be that price seem to be reason but the portion are pretti small my boyfriend order the galbi bowl on our most recent visit and he could definit not get full on that alone

but i will be back for the uni trio yummmmfar off the strip come a beauti place at a movi strip mall  rustic and industri it has a bar vibe but safe for famili with young kids

you got pizza drink and beet salad  you have my attention

1  the pizza that i order the settebello crush tomato pancetta wood oven sausag roast mushroom toast pine nut mozzarella basil extra virgin oliv oil  the crust was toasti with a medium crust  the chees was fantast  45 stars

2  the beet salad  good portion but ill pass the next time  30 stars

but the beet salad the level of servic inattent and flighti and the cocktail i order wrong twicelow the rate of my experi  would i go back  for the pizza but i would sit in the bar stick with a beer  free parkthere was much more to be desir after leav this festiv yes there were alot of food option and the cultur entertain was aright but thing like a market section wouldv been great where peopl could buy japanes ingredientsjapan creek market
tea vendor noodl demo mochi pound demosomethingcloth kitchen and home accentstokyo discount i dont know more stuff than just food vendor and an entertain stage there were a few peopl who also look cool in cosplaywa there a contest for that

a martial art demonstr wouldv been coolkar kendo aikido or even tradit danc too more seat wouldv been awesom for both the eat and stage area food option were cool but were lack in the dessert depart perfect scoop wouldv done well help everyon cool off and even suzuya wouldv made a kill on dessert and crepes

food wise we went for the out of townplac we havent tri spot we tri a curri okonomiyaki and the first bite were okay but toward the center it tast under cookedramen vendor hiromaru and iroha were the longest line so we hit those up although i thought hiromarus tonkotsu ramen was veri delici it was veri skimpi portion wise iroha spici ramen was pretti good too felt pretti bad for alot of the local vendorssora monta kyara yonaka etc as they didnt have line when we were there and we had half of yonaka offer the night befor so we tri other spots

hop more improv are made for next year festiv becaus i am a huge fan of japanes food art and culturealohathis was a fun event but not a great valu my husband and i were gift free ticket to this event and attend on sunday park was easi and free the line were not too long to get ide and to purchas token token cost 2 per token and it was 2 token for 1 taco and 3 token for alcohol margaritawineb 

some taco were better than other my favorit was the goat taco from gertrud and the carn asada taco from the four season the taco vari in size from a midsiz tortilla to a mini tortilla as well as various fill where some place were more generous than other it seem that the stand that had the largest taco won the contest we didnt tri those though 

los primo carniceria were serv authent street taco which were fantast but they hand us flyer advertis for their busi which offer 1 taco we were pay 2 for the taco there so we felt a littl rip off 

all togeth we spent 40 for 3 margarita 1 beer and 8 small taco plus if we were to purchas two ticket at 24 it total out to be 64 not worth the price in my opinion on a posit note this one of the few opportun to tri so mani differ type of taco in one place and we discov some new restaurpistachio latte

with las vega undergo their independ coffe shop renaiss a few year after most major citi it is perhap a testament to the local asian cultur that one of the more well receiv new locat has been serenad a korean coffe local situat in the southwest featur a well cull menu of drink and latt alongsid a small pastri menu and particular well regard honey toast the latter of which was to be the focus of an 8am saturday morn visit along with the oft rave pistachio latt  small and stylish with free wifi and comfort seat plus a soundtrack that is present but not invas it was with some irrit that true to rumor our arriv was origin met with the restaur claim to be unabl to make honey toast becaus they were out of bread while also confirm that none of the pastri were made inhous but in true servic recoveri mode it was then with some surpris that upon hear about our reason for visit a clerk was dispatch not onli to retriev bread but also to prepar two order of the item for free  one tradit one with garlic and both top with ice cream plus honey  admit impress by such a show of servic though still a bit mystifi as to howwhi they would allow this issu to be recurr i must say that overal the latt was servic albeit a bit cooler than id prefer while both of the honey toast were quit good the textur everi bit on par with ichiza and better than spot while the qualiti of the bread and ice cream outstrip both  perhap a bit too new to judg i cannot say yet that id rush back to serenad given the distanc from my home but at the same time id also not hesit to recommend a visit provid ray and team straighten out the bread situat as the garlic honey toast is definit someth that need to be experienc to be appreciit a dunkin donut  i dont know what the commot is about the coffe order a medium 179 black no cream or sugar and it noth special  wait  actual ive had horribl coffe at fast food restaur casino employe cafeteria plane and hotel coffe pod so scratch that  the coffe here is decent

ask the cashier if the oldfashion and the chocol coconut donut were glaze and powder sugarfre and she assur me two time yes so i ask for one chocol coconut donut 99 cent doubl chocol donut roll in sweeten coconut flake  photo come soon  it good but i see that it was glaze so that the flake had someth to hold onto  im hope that the organ appl solubl and nonsolubl fiber yknow i brought with me will help mitig my allerg reactiondure a recent vacat we found ourselv in a differ gate area a than normal and hope for some breakfast option to enjoy befor head out of town i was pretti excit when i saw four peak and that they were open for breakfast 

i love four peak and will alway continu to support them by enjoy their amaz beer and tasti food for lunchdinn but one thing i cant say i love was their breakfast at the airport the environ was great and this would be a perfect spot dure the lunchdinn hour but the breakfast menu was veri limit and includ a beer bread breakfast option breakfast burrito and a basic egg meal among a coupl other item i went with the basic egg meal which came with egg bacon and toast it fill me up but i would have love a littl more flavor and flare luckili they had mimosa when we got there so i enjoy one but learn they ran out of them dure while we were dine unfortun our waitress kember was a littl stress when we dine in and was pretti unhappi and express it to me when i ask to borrow a pen when we first sat down the pen never arriv and it wasnt until the check came that she final ask if i still need the pen this was about 40 minut later by then i had figur out anoth solut to find a pen

whil our breakfast experi at the airport four peak was not what i would have hope for one of my favorit breweri in town i will give it anoth chanc in the futur but not dure breakfasttim hope we get a nicer server next time aroundim disappoint the qualiti of food and servic on my second visit diminish great it seem to me that they strive to have delici and high qualiti food for the first month then becam complac and allow the servic and the food to go downhil from there how unfortun i dont eat much but here are my complaint whi is the rice so dri it so easi to cook rice and this is a sushi restaur that is complet unacceptable

meanwhil the order in which the food was brought out made no sens we order miso soup salad nigiri kalbi pork belli among other item whi brought out the main entre first wouldnt it make more sens to bring out the soup and salad right away and how is it that the bowl of rice was brought out last all you have to do is scoop it out of the rice cooker into a bowl and serv it 

also we were unimpress at how dri and tasteless the pork belli was as if it was made and sat out for a long time last i want to order a la cart but the waiter assum we all want the all you can eat option we werent even ask whether or not to go with the all you can eat terribl servicwe came here last night for dinner 

we were greet and sat immedi the hostess was veri friend and our waiter was veri attent 

they dont have a larg portion to choos from on their menu for tapa  but all of the tapa are half off on monday which is super nice 
also the wine list isnt veri larg but they have a full bar for everyth els 

we had a fair decent number of dish 
angus sliders
stuf peppers
artichokes
filet
scallops
asparagus
lava cake

everyth was okay the garlic aioliif you dont want insan strong garlic in your mouth for hour steer clear 
most of the dish were fair bland and there wasnt much to them 
everyth came out veri quick  the waiter said they dont let anyth sit in the window and it all made fresh which was bizarr becaus a few of the dish he brought out were bare luke warm so i dont believ that was the case
it seem in a way that he was do his best to convinc us that the food was good 
he was a great waiter but the foodit was mediocr 

i cant see myself come back againi like good food especi when im pay for it we order a few item on the tapa menu food is okay although some of the item remind me of julian serrano menu the execut was decent but the food didnt tast veri good one thing though i notic the other review mention how small the portion were yet all of the item we order came in huge portion 

your probabl better off go elsewher for tapai watch this place sit idl dure the great recess and then was so pleas to see someth go in there when the economi improv  toro spanish kitchen  game is a good addit to the small shop center

w stop last night and had dinner  i had look over the menu onlin but i want to look at their in hous as there were other item than the tapa id seen onlin  our server brought ice tea  we had to wait a bit to catch the server eye to get some sweet n low but eventu we got it

th complimentari toast slice of bread was nice  i use it more for a pusher than anyth els  

i order three item to startan order of sauté mushroom in garlic and sherri wine gnocchi with shrimp in a garlic cream sauc i thought id be abl to sneak the shrimp past my wife and last an order of croqueta with ham cream chees and béchamel  

the winner of the trio was the gnocchi with shrimp  when my wife got to the one shrimp i hadnt been abl to screen out with the spoon that was all for her  score for mei finish the dish  the gnocchi were soft and the shrimp although small were good  it was a nice combin  next the garlic mushroom were realli good  sauté nice in garlic and sherri the mushroom were veri good  the disappoint dish for me was the croqueta  they were veri light and had hard and bodi to them yet it was difficult to pick them up  they broke in half  there was not a béchamel sauc but a marinara like sauce

w decid not to order more  the three dish were fillingwel almost  we order the chocol lava cake  it take 15 minut to make the menu state this clear so if your in a hurri order earli  the lava cake was rich chocol cake with chocol sauc and a scoop of vanilla ice cream  a nice way to end a good dinner

servic was spotti  our server seem to be nowher in sight for much of the time while the server who had the tabl on each side of us seem to be at those tabl all the time and the place was not that crowd  dure dinner the owner came around to ask how thing were and the person touch is alway appreci  it also veri good busi  the spotti servic kept me from give toro four stars

i thought the price was veri fair  if you subtract the desert we had from the bill the total would equal about what i paid for 1 person at anoth tapa place and i left hungri  two of us ate for the same coast and we left without feel hunger

w need to come back and tri some of the other dish  i also need to come back with some friend and without my wife  there are item id like to tri from the menu that she wont eat  her loss  time for a uyewhile the citi of madison is most certain a metropoli of wonder eclect restaur the town doe lack in a certain categori of cuisinecomfortfood in larg part the restaur in this capit citi either fit themselv into the delin of a trendi gastropub or a divey burger joint therefor when new foodi destin bassett street brunch club open it door this past thursday i was super pump serv up classi spoof on tradit breakfast dish and diner fare all day long the brunch club add an entir new dimens to madison latenight soooo for these random moment where it midnight and im crave pancak or chicken  biscuit it nice to know this place has me cover  

in term of ambienc the trendi embellish of the restaur all merg to devis a conclus atyp rendit of the convent diner in fact bassett street brunch incorpor the swank of black leather booth with a back of wackycolor upholsteri the pattern is bold and the contrast is strike yet this sens of stylist flair is a defin featur of the space which distinguish basset street brunch as an upscal repositori for ardent breakfast enthusiast 

the menu itself is laden with savori brunch option as well as more dessertlik breakfast concoct all of which are tantal express with an aureat collect of delici diction the brunch club transform classic comfort food into wildlyimagin dish the like of a savori french toast of sourdough bread drench in an indulg blend of parmesan chees and herb then top with layer of bacon arugula grill onion a sunnyup egg and a drizzl of hollandais similar delici was the farmer hash that i sampl which was compos of a medley of roast sweet potato brussel sprout and parsnip all sauté with onion and rosemari top with two egg and serv with a hefti side portion of rye toast cozi comfortfood at it best 

the more sugari item on the menu were also danger tempt with allur descript of lemon ricotta pancak and an oatmeal crème brulé and that not to mention the rotat assort of donut that the shop bake up daili and as i am quit a fanat donut freak i knew that i had to check these guy out although the chocol sprinkl and peanut butter capn crunch donut varieti that i ventur to tri were rather dens and lack in the bold flavor profil i was anticip i will most certain dabbl into some of their other varieti in the futur 

as a whole the addit of bassett street brunch club to madison repertoir of food joint was an expert calcul decis in that breakfast at all hour is now a secur option while the price are a tad unsympathet in term of colleg student budget the ingenu of the menu item for the most part erad ani pecuniari hesit with dine here bassett street brunch club varieti of comfortfood offer is sure to satisfi ani appetitsinc my last review the menu has expand and the decor has had a much need upgrad well done 

with the new addit there were still some execut issu tuna slider cook all the way through yeeek but overal it was a way better dine experi than in my previous visit manag were on hand and quick to fix the problem with our lunch poor made food was off of the bill and cinnamon roll waffl were on the hous in a matter of minut not bad

look forward to my next visit to tri more of the new menu which is way more than i can say about my last visit    5 star upgradbe a big fan of the origin mr sandwich i was excit to give this new locat a tri while in the area and feel hungri this locat was former a tcbi locat but they have made quit a few renov and it seem much more roomi now there are lot of tabl wifi and even a littl stage that look like it readi for karaok but i could be wrong they are still put the finish touch to the restaur but it come along nicely

for their grand open they have quit a few special go on 495 pho and bogo thai and milk tea which i took advantag of the drink were solid and so was the food again the bread wasnt do it for me unlik the origin locat the bread was a littl crustier and not as soft and fresh as i like for the most part everyth els was great

il be back sinc im in the area pretti often and look forward to give their sandwich anoth tri as well as the rest if the menuclever koi is like the 1st luxuri car i purchas sexi stylish desir  i was excit to own it but after the novelti wore off i realiz that it wasnt quit as special as i thought it was

i gave clever koi 4 star on my 1st review they got that becaus overal the food was pretti good but the atmospher and present bump it a star consid you cant give a 35 star i gave it a 4 partial becaus i think the place is realli cool and i want it to succeed but after 4 visit im current the duke of this establish as you might see im make an updat base on subsequ visits

let me address the food everi time it has been plate and present so art and you can tell that the menu and dish were meticul plan the problem is the execut like tonight for exampl i order the chicken fri turkey wing and it look delect but delect it was not it was dri so dri it would have been ined had it not been for the hous sriracha sauc i request my friend had the pork ramen he state that the broth tast like pure soy sauc and he was not satisfi with it 

on a prior visit i also had the one of the steam bun with some sort of pork the pork was quit chewi and the green that were insid the bun had a strong vinegar flavor it just wasnt good i wont carri on about everi imperfect but im adjust my rate to a 3 becaus after extens explor of the menu the food just doe not live up to a 4 star rate 

tonight mgmnt certain made a more than adequ effort to save my experi and i great appreci them cover our bill howev i feel the respons to the yelp communiti to share honest feedback and after 4 visit it was necessari to updat my review to reflect what i have experienc i still think it an innov and uniqu place and will continu to come for drink but overal the food has been averag at best and they maintain a 3 from me becaus of the locat creativ present and the atmospheri guess this place is ok when your in a pinch get it  we were look for a quick bite to eat on the way to the smith center who knew le thai was close on sunday anywho we end up at the contain park 

we both settl on the pinch combo which is 3 street taco with your choic of meat i went with carn asada shrimp and fish i couldnt tell the differ between the shrimp and the fish there was so much bread on them they also charg you 50 cent each taco for upgrad to seafood elot was pretti good not the best ive had  littl heavi on the mayo horchata was good

for 35 for two peopl to have street taco and a fountain drink it was a tad overpr in my opinion noth was that good for me to come back againthe staff was friend recommend the pull pork  the price are a littl on the high side for what you receiv but not unreason given the area of town and the imag of the contain park   the mac and chees was bland and the potato salad although most potato the way i like it was also flavorless  the pull pork was good and i enjoy the fact that it was not oversauc and there was extra sauc avail but the sauc was tasti but had no wow factor to separ it from other sauc  the pork itself was veri tender  the star of the plate was the link  a littl kick of spice set them apart from the rest of the food and i wish that was the item i had chosen as my onli item  will have to tri the rib next timebbq in a container

anoth cool restaur locat in the downtown las vega contain park when walk into the park it is a short stroll off to the right hand side on the main level

 been here a few time while visit the contain park with famili and friend the rib mac n chees are my usual but ive been told the brisket isnt so bad 

the bbq here overal is not  to bad it isnt the best in town but not bad for the locat and general access to hearti meal they also offer a few beer on tap which is a nice touch to wash down your bbq like all the contain park restaur they use the biodegrad silverwar and plate which is a nice touch

usu i have found a lot of the time come here it can be a pain long line and onc you have your meal the seat area is quit limit in the actual contain outsid seat is is also offer but usual takin up by someon watch the main jungl gym

overal

back again yup but becaus of the contain parkim glad subway took over quizno becaus i wasnt a fan of that locat this subway is open 24 hour i came in just befor 9 pm and order a cold cut combo for 5 plus tax i becam nervous when the girl who took my order said she had to examin the meat first to see if it was still good becaus it had been sit in the contain for a while wtf we all know subway isnt known for slice fresh meat or serv meat that is of good qualiti but come on i was skeptic howev everyth look fresh to me i have to say my sandwich was great noth smell funni and the sandwich look great i came back the next day for lunch and that sandwich was good too insid was clean and i realli like the conveni of them be open 24 hour tri the cooki they are actual goodwe had dinner reserv at crush for christma it the restaur that took over the space where nobhil use to be it had big shoe to fill but we were hope sinc it own by michael morton who is also the cofound n9ne at the palm the restaur has a rustic chic garden feel it wasnt too busi on christma eve despit other restaur be quit crowd we had a booth in back after ask not to be seat at the hightop bar tabl near the entri 

they offer a nice blend of cocktail wine and beer we had kronenbourg blanc 9 and oro di milano riserva 14 on the pricey side but i appreci the rare select the menu follow the current trend of small plate and specialti pizza with a few larg plate select for those who prefer the old school way of dine we start with the ricotta gnocchi with brais short rib 16 it offer as a small plate but we share as an appet it hard enough for two but quit enjoy the shortrib was rich and decad the gnocchi was tender and light though it had less ricotta flavor than anticip 

we each order larg plate for our entre my husband chose the lamb sirloin with brussel sprout 38 and i had the seabass with kale 34 larg plate portion are not for hearti appetit but definit an upgrad from the small plate he realli enjoy the brussel sprout and the lamb was tender and cook medium rare as request but there was a flavor that was off put he bare touch it the waiter took notic and offer someth els from the menu after some urg he chose the wild mushroom pizza 16 

the pizza was pretti darn good the crust was nice and crisp the fontina was creami and pair well with the earthi of the mushroom 

mi seabass and kale was prepar and serv in parchment paper it was top with a tomato chutney the flavor were good but the textur overal was one note mushi it wouldv been better with some crunch i tend to prefer fish with a nice sear 

while dinner might not have been top notch the staff was veri accomod they went out of their way to be sure we were satisfi i give them prop they sent out a complimentarti nutella crunch dessert for the troubl hazelnut and nutella are a match made in heaven the dessert did not disappoint 

crush has onli been open a few week so they may hit their stride given more time4 star for the design ambianc and servic 3  for the food  not feel like round up to 4 start  

a friend and i came in on a saturday even we arriv and were seat in the main dine room quick  our first visit we were determin to tri and share a varieti of dish to get a good feel of the menu  we start with drink i order the ginger cooler which was bold and flavor  go for a 34 cours affair we start with the popov lure in by the ham butter on top of the fact they are popov i am a big popov fan   they came out quick i am not use to this for popov leari i touch the popov to find it bare warm  the plate they were serv on seem warmer  we advis the waiter and they brought out just as quick anoth pair  a littl warmer  ok i guess this is their thing  the ham butter was good but the herb butter was our favorit  the rich full flavor of the butter and the distinct fresh herb flavor realli pick up the warmish popov 

 next we tri the roast brussel sprout cesar  the cesar dress was spot on with a love present anchovi flavor and was not like a creami ranch like dress as done in so mani place anymor i wish for a bit more brussel sprout and a littl less romain lettuc  

the main cours was tough to decid upon  we final went for the gemelli pasta with bacon  now this was a total comfort food pasta cook to perfect al dent rich smooth cream sauc and larg chunk of hambacon  i would go back for this  

when it came time for dessert we ask the question base on what we had thus far which we overal consid just okwa it worth gettingtri   we decid to pass on dessert  

we absolut love the decor and ambianc while i do see myself return in the futur it is not someth i am rush to get back to all that sooni guess i may have to accept the fact that im alway gonna have a bone to pick with sam fox  onc again i step into a restaur that hit a home run on aesthet but fall short on the cuisin  it seem to be a run theme that i just cant shake with fox concept  perhap it all a matter of play the expect game but for the price they charg i would expect someth at least somewhat worthi of the decor im eat in  but like so mani of fox other concept the food leav me with one emot  meh

th henri is a newer addit to the fox lineup set in what was an old offic build in the super trendi arcadia neighborhood in east phoenix  the build itself is spectacular  it a two stori structur that open from the insid though the restaur onli occupi the first floor  the restaur is actual three part  on the west side is a banquet area for privat parti on the east side is the main restaur and a great outdoor patio complet with a fireplac and in the middl is a littl coffe and juic bar  the furnitur and wall paper have a pretti contemporari feel border on english tudorish  the place has been jam pack sinc it open but fortun we didnt have to wait long on sunday we got a tabl in just under 10 minutes

th dinner menu of the henri has no rhyme or reason nor ani discern run theme  i did pickup the fact that they use mushroom in a lot of their dish  great if you love mushroom not so great sinc i dont care for em  for an appet we got some of the grill artichok heart  i love artichok but these tast pretti bland  and there werent that mani on the plate  wors yet it was 13 for that littl dish  we also share the white truffl fri with parmesan  much better  fri were cook well and the truffl aioli was excel  they also come with a super spici ketchup serious itll surpris ya  my brother had mention some good review about the buttermilk fri chicken sandwich particular the bbq mayo that come on top so i got that for my entre  the chicken was fri adequ but i didnt pick up hard ani of the bbq flavor i expect  for dessert i got the blueberri pie  this save the night  blueberri with greek yogurt on top and tini hint of lemon zest  good clean simpl delici  my famili also share the chocol cake and bread pud but i wasnt terribl impress with how either of those tast  to drink i had their homemad mix berri lemonad  super refresh drink as it wasnt too acid or overpow but the big downsid was the absurd amount of pulp in my drink  my straw kept jam up becaus of all the pulp get stuck in there

so just to recap  five star for the ambianc and the friend servic  no issu on either front there  but two star for the food  as with so mani other fox restaur ive been to i feel like im pay three star price for two star food  and the item i order tonight were on the cheaper end  the women in my famili cant seem to get enough of whatev sam fox touch but my experi have been habitu averag  for happi hour i probabl wouldnt mind come back here but id probabl pass if ask to come here for a full meal next timethe world of 1015 burger has a new contend as bb burger  beer is now open it in the venetian next to the poker room the old rattl can locat 

the burger were good i had the drive thru burger it was their take on an in  out burger the burger was cook to a perfect med rare and the top were fresh but it seem like it didnt live up to the 9 price point it was good just not 9 good 

i also had the pickl fri and not fri pickl and pickel veggi the onion ring and sp chip the chip were great the onion ring were pretti good i wasnt a fan of the fri pickl they use bread and butter pickl not dill which was a disappoint to me

al in all it was good but not omg great it will blend into the stream of the never end burger joint on the strip im honest a littl bum they close rattlecan and replac it with this place itll have to ride the celebr name on the door or it will end up get lost

th servic was pretti solid but noth realli stood out from the meal it was an ok burger in a pretti generic place at strip price im not realli in ani hurri to go back for anoth visitbecaus vega didnt have quit enough celebrityback burger joint the venetian recent open the tonguetwist bb burger and beer by batali and bastianich this restaur replac the short live and high tout rattlecan which serv some fantast burger and had a great interior there was a lot of drama surround their earli demis but rumor flew around of the space not be what the venetian want to display and other odd thing that rumor is slight hard to believ when you look at the atroc of design close by that is the bourbon room so who know regardless this duo provid some great meal in other locat within the properti and throughout other part of the countri so sure it would be a good replacement

a i mention abov the interior of rattlecan was great custom graffiti everywher cool artwork and a great bar made of skateboard deck what has replac it is a bright bore and poor decor space that feel much smaller than it predecessor and somehow way less invit the orang yellow and red tone are horribl from the floor to the wall sconc the tabl look cheap and the space overal just doesnt look like a burger joint that sell 14 burger the mute wood tone in the clunki booth section bisect the space as well as the dull back bar do noth to spice up the environ and the wavi ceil featur made me feel like i was in a denni their menu is pretti simpl snack salad shake burger and hero the snack and salad dont seem offer much and the hero sound more impress than their small hand of burger choices

with a recommend by the waiter i went with the royal with chees robiola chees caramel onion grill treviso and parmigianomarscapon cream what came out was a decent size burger accompani by an odd side of pickl carrot and onion the bun was fresh gooey and well proport the meat was realli good veri fresh and juici just lack ani season or flavor the burger was veri creami almost too much the onion were bare notic asid from a coupl bite and the treviso wasnt strong enough of a flavor to be notic but good on it own when pull out overal it was a veri good burger messi creami juici all the thing youd want but there was just that bit of beef flavor that was missing

a for the fri this is where the restaur start to piss me off spend 6 for a side of fri when your alreadi spend 31 on two burger is just insult even on the strip these onstrip place need to rememb that there is a huge local base of custom here to support them if the price were even somewhat reason this price is not the fri themselv had good flavor were of the thin natur cut varieti but they were complet undercook you get a good size portion that can be share by two peopl but spend that much for just one person on a bit of potato is stupid for our two burger and fri we spent 40 befor tip and that just ridicul while they do offer up at least one decent burger i wasnt crazi about the bite i had of the realli good burger i didnt realli tri much els the slight ridicul price combin with my long for what use to occupi this space may not bring me back to tri anyth elsi have driven by this place with the intent of stop by on quit a few occas but after our date night dinner we had a bit of a sweet tooth and the perfect cure for that was the perfect scoop

whil perus the menu we were offer sampl of ani flavor we want to tri i tri the durian ice cream while my fella sampl a few of his favorit the durian was realli good ill probabl be get a scoop of this the next time im there my fella combin flavor and order a red bean and black sesam milkshak and i went safe with a lavend milk tea the wasnt my favorit so ill skip that next time the milkshak was delici perfect thick and not over sweet you have the choic of milk or almond milk which is a nice touch

with three more groupon to redeem i will be back and i cant wait to make it a regular dessert spot in chinatownim not much of a coffe drinker but on the rare occas that i am in need of a caffein fix drivethru is alway my prefer method have this option in the area is nice but i didnt love the drink 

servic was friend albeit a littl slow for there be no line my ice coffe was a littl water down and i wish they had use more ice to keep it colder it all seem to have melt quick and was lukewarm which isnt particular appet 

for a quick morn jolt this is a good option but i dont see it becom my goto coffe spot375 stars

th first question i ask do you have turkey  after i got a continu ear with a strong italian accent that was bare understoodh went on and on about what they do have  the long and short of it they dont   it not an italian market but it is a true italian deli  they dont have boar head like a typic place

sw is more befit to local i wouldnt go out of my way  it look like a deli not a restaurant

meatbal sandwich

present  50 star  it measur 89 inch  uncut and beautiful

pickup abil  10 star  it was mush in my hand  too much sauc  this doesnt happen at capriottis

meatbal 30 star  heavi not breadi enough to be light

sauc 20 star  a sharp tast like vinegar

chees 50 star  wonder qualiti of both parm and mozzarella 

bread 50 star  amaz  toasti and fresh

talk but a veri nice man  lasagn look great and huge slice at that  it might be worth give them anoth tri even though the sauc was questionableit couldv been a bad batchwas curious of tri this place sinc the food network show restaur express

i just wasnt impress pricey friend staff but a tad bit on the slow side restaur itself was a cool setup

what we had 
start off with 
 yuzu rita this was a delici saltedrimandal twist on margarita
 duck slider roast peke duck veget in a bao bun  quit tasty
 samgyeops lettuc wrap pork belli veggi rice wrap in lettuc of cours  mediocr noth special about the pork belli and whi the rice
 pan fri dumpl aka potstick  came out realli cold took a while to get our waitress attent to hope get a new one when it was exchang it was ok ive had better at panda express lol

then
 chicken fri skewer  the chicken was moist and the almost sweet and sour sauc that came with it was tasty
 should be call make it yourself street taco  wasnt a fan of have to work for my food but beef was good and tender
 rock shrimp tempura  overbread big piec of shrimp but was pair with a good sauce
 crab salad  although i did not have a tast of it i guess the present was good
 wonton soup  ive had better

dessert

 white chocol strawberri yuzu mouss  veri pretti but tast was ok

overal ill pass sorri seonkyungsame owner as the now close greek villag cafe and yanni gyro on maryland pkwi he sold about a year ago but the new owner kept the name it pretti much the same menu as the locat on maryland i order the gyro pita again but this time got the garlic feta fri for my side instead of hummus  pita 

the place is small it counter servic there are two tabl insid and one tabl outsid  so i had decid to take it to go 

i rememb from my previous visit to yanni that i wasnt a huge fan of the tzatziki it had too much dill for my like just my person prefer the pita was warm and soft but the gyro meat a combo of lamb and beef was a bit dri this time around and it had a slight discolor on one side of the meat like the part that was on the outsid of the spit mayb too long the garlic fri were pretti good guess im underwhelmoh nooo anoth gourmet hot dog restaur onli sucker eat gourmet hot dog and i my fellow yelper am a sucker 

i went on the first day of the partial open of the linq and to be expect not mani peopl were there actual no one except for my group and the worker it locat right outsid of oshea and right next door to purpl zebra 

the menu httpwwwhautedoggerylvcommenusmenu

if you dine at ani of the other block 16 hospit restaur public hous barrymor holstein lbs and pink then youll see a lot of similar ingredi and similar flavor especi with holstein a lot of their offer have the same name the el machet was the onli hot dog i tri how was it it was good super clean tast frank but it wasnt 8 good man im definit a sucker or perhap money is burn a hole in my pocket to be spend 8 on a hot dog i definit felt like i was eat that strip up charg of cours in true vega fashion there must be someth vega and that is the billionair dog grill kobe beef frank foie gras torchon port onion marmalad and truffl mayo get em tourist

next time nah probabl notstop in today for a protein fix  for varieti they seem to have quit a bit of jerki flavor although the vast major head in the spici direct and they onli have beef and turkey unless i miss someth  they will let you tri sampl and i have to say the meat was veri tender  the carn asada was a littl on the dri side but the other meat were soft  i was not that impress with the spice the tripl threat had a littl kick at the end but i expect a burn the tongu flavor  still it was hot enough to burn my eye when i rub it  

to sum up give it more spice less brown sugar and take a buck off the price when you buy 3 you still pay 700 for each 35 oz bagi have veri mix feel about fat dumpl on the one hand there are some serious flaw with this restaur but on the other they serv some good tast food that i realli like

first upon enter the restaur we experienc a veri unpleas odor you get use to it but it is veri worrisom for the futur of this establish id recommend they figur out what caus it and get it under control

second get some control over your servic we experienc some veri basic servic issu they were certain friend but you need to give us some plate to eat our food on they were alllll over the place i couldnt even tell if the server were assign to ani particular tabl some basic train and manag would easili take care of that

but in the end the dumpl we had were pretti good the littl basket dumpl although good had no soup in them at all we will go back to give them anoth tri we hope that they get it togeth becaus they are realli close to have someth super goodsaw the show tonight with max for me it was like watch a tamer version of absinth max was truli impress and enjoy this show a great deal in which i think most tourist would have similar reaction i have to be honest here becaus i found myself a littl bore throughout some of the act my favorit act were the open beambalanc girl and the water bathtub with that smoke hot acrobat guy so i guess there are good moments

i think it a good show to see just onc the drink here are expens but that is a givenless of a show and more of a cool thing to do while you drink at your tabl and eat dinner in the other roomat least that the idea but most peopl will agre with me that a ticket at that price should be more like show i think their social experi was kind of a failur here

and by the way there a restaur connect to it i know weird i kind of dont get it i mean i get what they were tri to dobut i think the concept is a failure

strong prefer absynth same produc over this we love that show probabl one of our favorit mix in raunchi comedi with vegasstyl acrobatics

i most didnt like the magic act you can alway figur out how it was done and i hate that

som nuditi my husband appreci that haha but noth crazi i do know that the show at midnight is onli half an hour signific cheaper and way more xrated

with all that said if your stay at the cosmo it is a cool thing to dothis place is pretti decent just be warn there is alway a long line so if you are tri to have a quick bite skip kneaders

they have a veri larg menu fill with a lot of differ sandwich soup salad bread pastri desert pretti big menu for a bakerycafé i enjoy a bowl of their tomato basil ravioli soup along with their french dip the soup was veri tasti i just felt like it was a littl wateri thicken it up some more and you would have a perfect tomato soup the sandwich was definit fill but i feel like that was all bread the bread was veri thick and soft but i feel like it was a littl much for it took away from the insid of the sandwich which was the roast beef and chees along with the au jus sauc this was a pretti decent sandwich i just like my sandwich with more meatfil and less bread last but not least of all i finish up lunch with one of their doubl fudg browni you can not go into this place and not order some kind of sweat treat they are everywher the doubl fudg browni was moist veri chocolati and let just say warm my soul lol

th onli thing i dislik about this place is the home décor they have for sale in the center of the café the café is quit busi so they could definit use the space for tabl and chair for their custom to eat it a cute littl touch to make the café a littl more homeycountri feel but it take up a lot of space and make the café feel quit enclos with all the small pictur plaqu apron and littl knickknack for saleafter have dinner here i cant say im hook my wife love her pasti but i didnt feel the same way about mine i had the italian pasti and there was a good amount of meat like salami capocollo pepperoni ham it also had mozzarella chees and came with a side of marinara sauc the insid of my pasti was realli good i didnt like the hot pocket type dough so much though befor my pasti came i grub on some oven chip with jalapeno the oven chip were veri greasi and somewhat burnt at the same time and i didnt like that the jalapeno easili fell off sinc there was no chees or gravi to hold it all togeth we were eat with yelper loon e and his woman and they felt the same way about the oven chip and found their dish to be too salti 

our waitress was nice and took good care of us i cant say id hurri back next week but sinc my wife like her pasti and you can order them for pick up to take home and cook yourself i might give a differ pasti a triyelp 365 challeng 201489365 cravin cajun reincarnated

a bunch of us stop in as a plan b after we sad found out that inaba was close for the even restaur these day have the wierdest name i kept call this restaur one direct after find out the correct name it still remind me of the hunger game not a restaur  oh well

w share a few app and start out with the tamarind wing and the garlic serrano pepper wing which were both puni in portion and veri underwhelming
w also share the beef carpaccio which was delici and the star of the appetizers

for my entre i order the district one combo plate with the kalbi short rib i ask to substitut vietnames red rice with extra garlic this plate was good but not great nice tast and char on the short rib but unfortun the rice was red but kinda bland and there was no extra garlic like i ask for there also was piec of chines sausag and a littl pile of kimchi on the plate as well but seem like it didnt realli flow with the rest of the compon 

after get a tast of amelinda slow brais pork belli in coconut water so frickin ono that would be the dish i would return for if you have the chanc order this dish dont ask question just do it  aloha

littl more than aok right now with wiggl room for improvhad this place bookmark for a while after hear other yelper recommend in yelp talk 

came here for lunch on a tuesday afternoon 

exterior look like one of those old style diner insid total not what i expect yeah it still had the diner look for the tabless but the kitchen area was revamp 

in a way like a fast food kitchen kind of more like capriotti style kitchen  

be a restaur that was featur on food network travel channel  of cours i had to check out their specialti item the award win italian beef 3 differ choic to pick regular al big al or al combo beef and sausag with option to add more meat to the regular or big al also the option to add homemad hot or sweet pepper provolon cheddar or american chees at the cost of 45 cent each 

i had read on yelp a littl befor hand and peopl recommend to have it dip as well as add hot pepper so that what i did someon also had a tip to have it doubl dip but i fear it may make it too soggi so i opt for dip xd 

mi order came out pretti fast doublewrap on a tray i grab a decent amount of napkin becaus i knew it may get a bit messi becaus of the sandwich be dip 

for those who dont know what dip mean it when they dip the entir sandwich into au jus or similar have the entir sandwich soak in juic includ the bread  

after open the wrap it was pretti soak xd i dont want to imagin how doubl dip would be like  i tri eat the sandwich with it wrap on the bottom but it was too much of a hassl and went hand in d lol 

juici sandwich yes soak bread when i had order this sandwich i didnt know they were put a whole sausag vs sausag slice good and bad depend how you like it whole sausag take up space which mean not much beef but if you like sausag you get a whole sausag xd 

as i had mention befor i had ad hot pepper didnt realli notic it much yeah overal it was a littl spici not sure if it was becaus of the pepper or the saucejuic sandwich was dip in but it wasnt as spici as i had hope i like spici d 

overal not a bad sandwich may be a littl small for the price in comparison to other place but you cant realli compar this place to like subway or anyth it just differ would prefer it mayb a littl bigger and have a littl more beef in the beef and sausag combo 

servic is good there was a guy just go around collect finish tray and clean up didnt expect that 1 for him d 

the bathroom is super cold  lol i know it doesnt have to do with anyth but omg it like they have a separ unit for the bathroom xdi regret this rate and bemoan my disappoint becaus i did so want the barbecu promis in these yelp rate  one 3 star two 4star and 67 five star rate to date 

we onli had the brisket moist of cours and mayb it is superior to the arizona palat  i am a southcentr texan where barbecu is brisket and meat is beef  the rest be mere novelti item on the menu for the benefit of your inlaw from up north or for shirttail cousin from east texa and the rest of the deep south who eat pigs

i am truli sorri  i like the owner coupl that serv me and understand that she has austin root  my brisket was tender throughout but insid the smoke ring it was bland and flavorless  i wish them success all the same but i wont be back

you folk from new jersey that like joe outback honey bear dave or chili for link babi back pork or for god sake pastramikeep on plug this place with 5 star  if you dont know barbacoa as a sunday specialti dont even bother tri to rate texa barbecu it is beyond your ken

centr texansth closest thing to down home is still rudi at i10 and  chandler blvdi want to be clear  my review is not about the barbecu the que is great  when you can get it  

the first time i stop by i stood in line in the heat for 20 minut  was glad to final get insid and get my que and side and i realli enjoy them all  probabl some of the best que in town  

the problem isthey run out  and you never know when they are go to run out  you could drive over there and the sold out sign is alreadi hung on the front gate  that what happen the 2nd time i went by  a hour after they open theyr out  ive eaten a lot of great barbecu all throughout texa the south the midwestal seem to be abl to have plenti of qualiti meat and side avail dure open hour  most restaur seem to manag their food that way  run out is the except rather than the daili pattern  

this food is good  the thing is im just not will to drive over there again on the hope there might be some meat still avail that day it not that good  it like play barbecu roulett this ultim may damag their busi model nobodi continu to go to ani restaur where in your mind your alreadi know they might be out of what your look for ultim consum face again and again with that situat will got someplac where they know there will be food and they can sit down and have their meal 

ill settl for some pretti great cue at some other place around townthat alway manag to have plenti no matter when i get theremayb i had my hope too high go into this place due to the glow review but this place was just ok to me we got there right at 11 when they open and there was a hefti line whi is the line so long and move so slowli the owner individu cut meat for each personthi is nice and all but mayb dure the summer he may want to consid streamlin the process just a thought and yes the owner dad was charm and took us on the tour of the smoker which we enjoy but caus a littl stress as our spot in line inch toward the door we had been wait in the heat for a long time and didnt want to lose our spot anyway we made it back to our spot as we enter the door great we sampl the brisket it was veri tasti and tender get up to the counter our plan was that we would get a 2 meat plate and a sandwich to share with our two meat be the brisket and the special beef short rib order and was inform that the beef short rib didnt come on the plate umm mayb you should disclos this prior mayb i miss it i dunno the owner said look how big this is it cant go on the plate i guess but most of it bulk was the bone the actual amount of meat was not that larg regardless we end up get the two meat plate with pork rib and brisket side grit and bean the pull pork jefe sandwich pull pork sausag pickl we got it without slaw and a beef short rib that whi we came right the total 40 whoa that some expens bbq some of the food was veri good and other did not live up to expect the short rib was good but had a bit of a burnt flavor the pork rib were pretti bore no sauc the sauc they have on the tabl was not veri flavor and the meat didnt fall off the bone kind of a meh dish the brisket was good as previous state veri tender but a bit pepperi the grit were gluey and not spici enough for be bill as jalapeno and the bean were noth special either the sandwich was the stand out dish the pull pork was veri good i didnt love the sausag but the pork and the pickl with some sauc made for a tasti sandwich i dont know that i would be back anytim soon but if i did i would get the pork sandwich and be done 

ps i ate so much meat at this place im pretti sure i got the meat sweat so be care haha

thi morn we decid to tri out breakfast sinc we were run errand in the area  we sat in the main bar area and my first impress was i dont want to eat in a place that all i can smell is cigarett smoke  it just not appeal  it didnt seem so smokey the night befor but this morn was a differ stori  the menu look good and they serv breakfast 247  my husband had the build your own breakfast burrito sausag spinach tomato and chees and they forgot the sausag  i had the patti melt and it was meh  not great  not horribl  i order a bloodi marylet just say it need work  like a lot of work  i dont know what i had but it was no where close to a bloodi mari lack in tast and zip  our waitress seem nervous and ill chalk it up to the place onli be open for 2 day  but first impress she had the person of a log  on a side note the manag came over and introduc herself and was veri welcom perki and nice  like i said ill chalk it up to nerv and the new of it all

thi place has the potenti to be a great local hangout and the owner are experienc restauranteurstaverngril oper  well give it a month to work out the kink and go back and give it anoth go  howev itll have to be on the patio to avoid as much smoke as possibl if i want smoke with my food and drink ill go the casino across the street or to the irish bar at boca park point is summerlin doesnt need anoth smokey bargril  and mayb ill hand the bartend a good bloodi mari recip while im at it

i do hope this place doe well either waythe gentleman sit next to me at the bar and i were in agreement a name like distil might not appeal to both sex equal the place did appear a littl lopsid with few member of the smarter sex repres in the crowd but mayb it was just an off night

you have to be envious of the locat though i cannot for the life of me imagin whi the prior establish close down they made the best 5 burrito everi sunday morn in the park lot mani a westsid will find themselv in this area when on the hunt for food

at first i want to bemoan the continu downward spiral of the local las vega food scene specif the burger i order that they affection refer to as the cure but then i realiz 

ye  i definit want to bemoan the continu downward spiral of the local las vega food scene

th cure was well unremark in everi way despit a descript that promis so much 

hand craft burger ground beef and pork blend stuf with fontina chees top with soy marin onion jalapeño jelli lettuc tomato spici mayo and fri parsnip on a brioch bun 

doesnt it just sound tasti well it not unremark is the best way to describ it there was one more thing the second half of my burger was ice cold by the time i finish the first  not that the first half was pipe hot or anyth but ice cold

th bar menu has no section for distil spirit despit the name anoth thing the gentleman sit next to me thought was curious they did have a coffe infus whiskey as part of their signatur manhattan but if you didnt read the descript of the drink you would have never known they offer this unusu item i ask the bartend about the coffe infus whiskey  and befor i could even finish my sentenc he return with two shot of the curious liquid  one for me and one for this gentleman i just met  and then charg both of them to my tab wow really

if i were the one open a restaur in this enviabl western valley locat i person would have avoid the poker machin but then my goal would have been to wow patron with good food and servic rather than just open anoth smoki gambl hall

in all the food is not great the servic need a littl well delicaci and the place sure was overflow with men  but i thought is was okayfirst time i came here was at the yelp event that i pure enjoy came here last night to see how it like on a regular night the vibe is veri relax the bar seem pretti pack but you are abl to sit yourself in the dine area someon automat bring you a menu  let us know our server will be with us

erin was our server for the night we automat check into yelp  redeem our free whiskey shot we also order mad mule 10 which was serv at the yelp event  a cinnamon appl sour 7 appl sour was on the sour side  extrem strong the whiskey shot came in coffe  cinnamon flavor yuck those drink did the job done alright

for food
shrimp spinach artichok dip 999  it was veri veri veri veri bland it didnt have enough cheesi the shrimp didnt blend in well with the other ingredi a lot of chip not enough dip

street taco 799  shred chicken with usual content that come with a taco it had a chipotl dress on top these were pretti good still noth that made me want to order it again 

new york steak  egg 1199  beau said it was good cook perfect it came with hash brown  you can choos between english muffin or toast i tast it tast like regular steak ¯ツ¯ 

french toast 799  beau also got french toast guess he was hungri these were excel probabl best thing we ate last night it was light and fluffi 

erin our server was veri attent she came and check on us everi so often she was nice  had lot of person when ask if we can chang the channel of the tv next to us she said she would but she never did but we didnt make a big deal out of it other bummer she charg us for our free yelp check in shot of cours i told the beau to look at the item bill like i alway do  of cours he said he did but realli didnt men and just sign his life away later i look at the bill  we were charg for them insert angri facethis kookylook former fast food space is actual a pretti cool place to get some tasti treat specif macarons

w in for a late afternoon pick me up grab about six maracon to share with the bf pack in a takeout box for dessert then decid i should probabl eat real food befor eat sugar so i got a mushroom and goat chees quich heat up to go

th space is clean and the pastri case is pack differ quich and sandwich on one end ton of differ macaron flavor in the middl and more classic pastri and meringu on top and on the end anyth you can think of is here regular eclair coffeeflavor eclair fruit tart a strawberri shortcakelook confect both lemon and cherri meringu regular meringu more cake i dont know the name of and even some stuff that isnt in the pastri case
i tri the pistachio rose coffe ginger and peanut butter macaron and they were all tasti list in increas order of prefer i could eat a box of the peanut butter one on my own

then there was that quich it larg and the goat chees is super tasti but even though it was heat up for me the egg seem undercook and it was in need of some salt and my takeout box was not pack with ani utensil or napkin to eat with which was a littl bit of a headach when i got back to my offic im new and havent stash ani spare utensil away yet eventu i use chopstick and my hand seriously

sad to say that i subtract an extra star due to weirdborderlin rude staff i was help by a younger gentleman who tri joke around that everi item i order was out or just for display befor chuckl and pack it up for me it was awkward not funni and it got old fast establish rapport befor crack that joke or mayb do so with a smile it came off as realli rude for my first visitcame here on their 2nd soft open day there was a lot of waiterswaitress wait at the door and greet us the second the door open two of my friend had alreadi arriv by the time my friend and i had gotten there oop i took the long way there appar xd or rather the slow way haha 

first impress  lot of peopl work probabl to get use to the environ and process decor veri simpl red and white first thought i had whi doe this remind me of in n out lol anyway design almost kept like how it was when cafe de japon exist bar area more open now with the various tabl set up chair are a bit bottom heavi so not too easi to move 

each person is serv with a small salad bowl even befor order surpris 

sinc it is still their soft open they were not offer their complet menu

carbonara ramen  1095  signatur ramen noodl fusion inspir by popular italian carbonara pasta a soup base with the origin tonkotsu pork broth and milk top includ is an egg yolk  bacon shiso and fresh scallion the type of noodl select for this ramen is flat thick noodl 

first impress someth new to tri their rendit of a popular italian dish in a japanes style soup base is light due to the broth be mix with milk which i dont think is normal cow milk remind me of soy milk mayb noodl are thick nontradit ramen noodl which you dont see often but cook to a nice al dent which give a nice bite  d the egg yolk im pretti sure was laid in raw and left with the broth to cook slight give a nice rich flavor overal bacon give a nice flavor esp sinc they had it light sear on a grill but not a fan of bacon the shiso leaf actual look me off guard give someth along the line of mayb a basil flavor overal this ramen is not bad sinc it lighter than the shiroi tonkotsu ramen not my favorit but i like the noodl they use 

shiroi tonkotsu ramen  795  the best salt ramen is creat with salt sauc and brown garlic oil a soup base with the origin tonkotsu pork broth with salt sauc top includ is chashu pork hardboil egg fresh scallion and kikurag the type of noodl select for this ramen is thin noodl 

thin noodl overcook in my opinion cook a bit too long lost it bite the soup is quit salti probabl from the salt sauc whatev that could be veri heavi in garlic flavor most from the garlic oil it was surpris to me they did hardboil egg id prefer a softboil egg with a runni yolk the kikurag woodear fungus is quit normal to be in a japanes style ramen the thing that was nice to me was the chashu in comparison to like monta this was not fatti at all major meat with a thin line of fat a nice touch is they sear it on a grill add a nice flavor to it not a bad ramen though soup base with the salt sauc what is this is quit salti 

dure this soft open they also had a few side order avail 

hiromaru gyoza  550  grill pork dumpling

hiromaru bun  600  two steam bun fill with butabara pork belli and serv with hiromaru origin sauce

karaag  500  japanes fri chicken

pretti good  to start off the meat is a dark meat on top of that it marinatedseason so even the insid of the meat is flavor the batter use is not too thick and is nice and crispi nice side to get  

hiromaru japanes curri  850  japanes style curri rice with chashu pork

to be honest upon bring brought out this order first thing that came to mind was overpr at 850 you get about the amount of a small bowl of rice in a pool of curri sauc one slice of pork two short spear of asparagus and a sliver of red bell pepper the curri sauc  veri underwhelm flavor wasnt there felt dilut not flavor at all like some curri some had said it like what you would get from a box of curri at a groceri store to me it was not strong at all i tast the sauc straight up if i had ate it with rice id be like uhhh where the curri asid from that one slide of pork realli wow 

servic wise they were veri attent they pick up finish bowl quick and were quick to refil on water hope their attent servic will last after open 

on the side note they have anoth room decor differ next door the waitress had told us it is for dinner servic for the izakaya as well has some privat vip room too the decor is complet opposit of the origin side 

overal not bad for a soft open and new style would like to come back to tri differ side dish next time gyoza and bun as well as the other two ramen they offer on their menu for the price ramen id say they should includ one more slide of pork though seem a littl skimp out on onli have 1 slicebase on my one visit i cant say im a fan of this place the kuroi tonkotsu 895 was an odd mix of tonkotsu ramen and black garlic with flavor fight each other for your attent the thin noodl were dens and somewhat gummi it a place to tri for the shear novelti factor of the uniqu type of ramen serv but i think i prefer a more tradit type of ramen if you sit at the counter prepar to bang your knee into the ledg beneath the counter if you tri to scoot in  and those seat are heavi and hard to move  there a high chanc of you hit your knee more than onci have been want to tri cheddar sinc the first time i saw the come soon sign mani month back after read through some of the review and talk to some cowork who had been i had my mind set on the fall off the bone rib last night  i was look forward to them all day yesterday we got to the restaur around 645pm last night and we wait about 30 minut which wasnt bad at all given that it is a new restaur the lobbi is veri welcom and i like the fish tank and the uniqu ceil fan the hostess were all veri nice

when we were seat we were greet right away by our waiter who was a veri young man and veri nervous he did have a hard time even get his word out so i was a littl worri about him it seem as though he had a rough night i like to give peopl the benefit of the doubt and i know it was there first week open and probabl his first waiter job i order a spici mango margarita and my fianc had a top shelf we both also order water the margarita took about 15 minut to come out and still no water we order our food and i was look so forward to the delici rib and mac and chees my fianc got the chicken finger with mash potato and corn about ten minut after order our waiter came back and said they had run out of rib i was so disappoint i want the rib so bad i know that this doe happen but it is realli all that i want at that point i decid to order a sirloin steak instead cook medium with mac and chees and green bean our food took about 20 minut to come out which wasnt too bad i order my steak medium and it was definit more like medium well and pretti dri it did have good season but the meat itself wasnt the greatest my fianc love his chicken finger and i had one and love it too the mac and chees was absolut delici and i would definit get it again the green bean here are realli bad and tast can and mushi do not recommend them i prefer crisp green bean  our waiter did come back to check on us mani time and even kind replac my green bean with a side a corn instead

overal i gave them onli three star base on the steak dinner which was realli just okay the chicken finger were good and i am impress that they make most food in hous the price are also veri reason i will be back to tri the rib which is what i realli want in the first placeflour  barley is the brick oven pizza restaur of the linq it is toward the center of the linq under brooklyn bowl and a stone throw from the high roller ferri wheel 

  where the high roller is current the largest ferri wheel in the world the flour  barley pizza pie seem to be the smallest pizza pie in the world okay  it probabl not the smallest but would be in the run i order the calabres which includ meatbal italian sausag mozzarella chili and verd i know this is the las vega strip and all but if you are charg 21 for a pizza pie pleas be a bit generous and offer more than four small slice to my eye this portion was the equival of hamburg slider 

  as some of the other yelper state flour  barley is an attract restaur with indoor and outdoor seat that overlook the linq if you pass over dine in this attract restaur  there is an outsid take out window

 insid this attract restaur are friend server they were on the 8 ball

 be a local i know that there is a world of better brick oven pizza restaur than flour  barley in the las vega valley and one of them is on the strip it is grimaldi pizza with locat in the palazza and fashion show mall for close to 20 grimaldi serv  a larger person pie with a coke and hous bread in a classi environ with all this said i do not see checkingin to flour  barley in the forese futur this review is be direct address to the owner 

in a nutshel  youv got the right idea at the right locat with the wrong price  

as soon as possibl your pizza need to drop to no more than 12 each  whi  they are the lightest and fluffiest pizza ive had in some time  kinda wonder bread pizza which isnt the worst thing in the world  it actual kind of cool  but not at 20 a pop for a snack pizza which doesnt quit feed one

your target custom is someon who doesnt want to spend this kind of money on the strip  that kind of what the linq is all about  anticasino  be outsid and freer somehow  goug on airi pizza is a serious mistake

th pizza my partner in crime and i had were tasti mind you  and the salad we order was delici  but rip peopl off becaus it the strip is stupid  it will lead to veri hesit recommend and hesit repeat business

a person pizza that is so light and airi would be about 6 anywher in the real world for in order to feel full youd either have to order a second or a side dish  adjust for the strip locat and such 10 feel about right

drop your damn pricei stop by on day 2 of it open all the sandwich are serv with chimichurri sauc and voila you get the restaur name there are about 5 differ sandwich option as well as a few empanada choic all the sandwich are serv on bread similar to that of a torta and when it come right down to it they basic are tortasserv on a loaf rather than a round meat chees lettuc pepper mayoif it tast like a torta look like a torta it is one and i think this is where the restaur will stumbl sandwich here go around 900 accompani by a smatter of fri for a slight lower price you can go to the numer mexican restaur that serv a far superior sammi  the chimichurri sauc is solid but they need to mix it up differ flavor profil etc if they want to make it for the long hauliniti score 3 star aok i do hope the owner has an open mind and take some of the critic to heart in refin what could be a 4 star treat with just a littl love

i order the classic american burger as i alway do when i tri a burger place for the first time  the classic allow you to tast the burger itself without bulgogi bacon cheez whiz and other ingredi mask the meat   dont misunderstand me you can have some tasti gourmet burger but to tell the truth a rice cake would tast good if you threw enough sauc chees korean bbq and spice on it no offens to those of you who like plain rice cakes

mi burger arriv and to be quit honest with you i was both happi and disappoint in what i saw  happi  clear the owner or chef insist on fresh ingredi  the lettuc tomato pickl etc were clear good qualiti and fresh  howev this lead to the disappoint  when i get a burger i dont want 2 ton of lettuc a tomato and pickl fall all over the place and stick out of the bun  the onli mess i want in a burger is juic and sauc come out with each bite  i had to remov quit a bit of lettuc just to get the burger to the point i could hold the bun without my hand be file with sauc cover greeneri   help owner tip use less of the top or trim them befor serv you will save money and custom will be happy

so i spent a minut or two trim the burger  the bun look toast and sturdi with a springi interior  i went to take a bite and bammm  noth  just a bite of bun   it took about 2 bite on ani side to get to the burger   i dont care how big your patti are no offens patti but the first thought that goe through ani burger connoisseur head in this situat is the restaur skimp on the burger  not true here help owner tip  bun too big get smaller bun 

so i final bit into the burger  the tast of bun sauc chees tomato lettuc and patti was good if a littl on the salti side but i immedi could tast the problem i was hope to avoid  to make sure i wasnt just out think my pallet i took a piec of patti from insid  lesson to burger creator  a good hamburg is not just a chunk of meat flatten and round  it must have season it must be cook right and most of all it must have season and be cook right  to me cook right for a burger mean just about medium with ani error on the slight pink side  i knew from the time it took to get my burger it was go to be overcook 10 minut cook time for a thin patti is too long  sure enough there wasnt a spot of pink to be found  as for flavor the meat itself had noth to offer but a hint of pepper  there were no negat feel toward the burger rather there just wasnt anyth that made me go yum give me more of that juici burger  in fact there was veri littl juic in my burger  help owner tip cook burger slight shorter and mayb sear it a littl more first  oh yeah more season in the burger

i did enjoy the overal combin of flavor but could not finish the bun and some lettucetomato henc wast food someth i was rais to avoid

which lead to the rest of the experi  the chees fri were simpli limp fri cover in what appear to be a cheez whiz or velveeta substanc that was ok but i wouldnt order it again 2 stars

th chip and salsa were not onli unexpect but they were actual quit tasti and i want to say they were homemad as one or two of the chip still had that soft to it onli homemad get  4 star on the chips

servic  4 star  it appear to be famili run and the owner or manag was friend the waitress was great  i was offer ice cream at the end i am not sure if it would have been complimentari or not but i declin becaus i was full and did not find out  i do apolog to the waitress  you pay first here and when i got up to leav i total forgot to leav a tip sinc i didnt get a check   she did clear my place and bring my food and i will like go back next week and give her a tip but i just realiz it as i was write this review

restaur  ok the entrepreneur in me hate wast space and the entir lobbi of this restaur is empti  there is a refriger and a biiiiig empty  help restaur tip  put up a rack or two and sell tshirt season packet barbecu sauc etc   it will make money and fill the space
th place was pretti clean  napkin come with your order and are skimpi and look like fold paper towel

th soda machin was not work so i was forc to buy can soda  also i didnt see ani unsweeten tea or bottl water it could have been there but i just didnt see it  good drink select though

so here is hope some of these tip are adopt by the owner as this place has potenti  rememb it not what on the burger it what in the burger
yelp 365 challeng 2014100365 izakaya cocacola

anoth new izakaya in town see other fellow yelper check in it was onli a matter of time until we had the chanc to experi cocokala for ourselvesveri wide select from skewer to grill item entre daili special and everyth in between the alcohol select here are pretti extens too i went with an interest sound oyster stout which had a similar tast to guin stout which i enjoyed

for the food the complimentari cold edamam was good and we also tri the karaag beef tonguepl miso black cod and three of their spoonsavocado 
uninori and salmonikura while the karaag was tasti all the other were forgett the spoon were basic knockoff nigiri on a spoon no one can touch ichiza kushitan period had better black cod at goyemon sen of japan ichiza soho and even the marketplac cafe at the cal shishito was noth special and the yuzu soda is noth like cafe de japon rip use to serve

with the wide select and price a bit higher qualiti has to improv great to compet with my two favorit spot in nearbi chinatownaloha

shaka meter  uuu  uuu  uuu  3some say that first impress are everyth  for me izakaya cocokala first impress was inconclus  compar to other izakaya in town cocokala offer are higher in price but not necessarili higher in quality

mi favorit were the chawanmushi miso cod and i believ the brais pork belli bowl  the chawanmushi was light on the seafood but it was a good version of the dish  the miso cod was flavor but a veri small portion  the brais pork belli was serv in a rich broth and was tender enough to easili pull apart with chopstick  

one disappoint was the bakudan dish which had natto as one of the main ingredi  instead of the expect intens smell and flavor of the soybean it turn out to be a veri bland dish  i onli manag to eat it with hot mustard ad  our tabl also order sever skewer all of which were averag and a bit pricey

so although cocokala first impress wasnt what i was hope for there was enough there that i want to go back and tri more of the menu  im not in a rush to do so but at least one more visit will be made onc the sake bar next door openthe food realli was exquisit it was master craft and made with the veri best of high end ingredi 

 i will be blunt and honest as i alway am

i get more fill up eat a select few sampl from costco than i did share two appet and one lunch plate at the local i do note costco sampl are not exquisit and i do prefer exquisit food

i enjoy the differ fresh flavor of what they call a roman style gnocchi i read that it made with semolina flour but if i were to name and guess what this dish was to me it almost seem like a polenta lasagna with a veri sweet slow cook tomato sauc to me it was veri interest and veri layer i tast mani differ compon i enjoy it my husband felt veri differ and i think he was in a bad mood i wont share what he said  1000 

we both enjoy the grill cauliflow veri much the cauliflow were roast with crispi end just like i make them and i never tast cook radish that tast that good everyth on that plate harmon well there just wasnt much of it  1200 

i was wrong not to say someth about the sear tuna nicois 1600 i think it was miss the calabrian chili oil that it desper neededan open hiccup  but after take a bite i had almost noth left so it didnt seem to be logic to say anyth this dish was beauti in appear for a moment i forgot where i was and was think binkley the fish was fresh but what i tast was a littl bland and flat i do note this dish came with an except good prepar 12 egg and crisp and creami fingerl potatoes

i enjoy the restaur where the chefown work befor so i thought id enjoy the local i did enjoy most of the food but it not enough to return to leav hungri again at the moment im wonder what did they do with that other 12 of egg

25 starmost newli open restaur do open with a few hiccup and that is to be expect henri privat kitchen open with a big menu of 200 item but you cant order ani of unless you can read mandarin chines they do have a one page menu without descript of 38 item for american our host seem veri friend and tri to be veri help dure our visit but onli recommend dish to us from the american menu i do note our host made the effort to ask me what i like and might have actual suggest the dish i might have enjoy most the host suggest a korean dish to me and a thai style eggplant i insist i want to tri taiwanes dish and that whi i came here so he then suggest the three cup chicken and the luffa

first come out the luffa the luffa was veri fresh and had a refresh qualiti to it like a cucumb but a meatier textur in a silki chicken base sauc we both were surpris on how good it was i usual can eat with chop stick but i wasnt advanc enough with chop stick for luffa it just keep slip out and the kind host offer me a fork

next come out the three cup chicken it is call three cup chicken becaus the recip was base on one cup vinegar one cup sugar and one cup soy sauc along with garlic and ginger and stud with that perfect amount of fresh thai basil that you onli get at best thai place it a classic taiwanes dish i thought the chicken was veri flavor and moist and good i am good with chicken on the bone but the piec of as tasti as it was chicken were veri small and not onli was the dish fill with mani small bone i had mani sharp shard of bone all threw the chicken 

i do think if the chicken was in slight bigger piec it would be fine but i also realiz it would have to cook longer

for me the food was good three star is not negat in anyway but it mean worth tri but with some reserv i do also note again that this busi has onli been open a week offer someth differ and is certain to improve

5 star potenti is herei was veri excit to hear that anoth henri open up and was awar that this restaur would be differentless casual from the temp locat and would cater more toward familieslarg group i get the concept but unfortun this place did not meet my expect i went with a friend and we both had mix feelings

with a place like this attempt to be more upscal and cater to chines famili they should realli have some complimentari hot tea our server told us that they onli serv ice tea and that it would cost money i decid to just have water which was serv in a cheap plastic cup the napkin which i usual dont bring up in my yelp review were realli thin and lowquality

th menu is certain impress but it is veri clear that they want to be exclus there are mani item on the menu but they are all in chines with no descript or english as a person who can read chines i even found the menu to be overwhelm not onli was it all in chines but the text was veri small even for my relat young eye they did have an english menu on the side with veri limit choic it was also unfortun that our server who was veri friend did not have much knowledg of the menu to recommend thing or describ how the dish are prepar if you do not read or speak chines good luck

th food we order loofah eggplant and fish wtofu was realli quit good this place is definit the most authent taiwanes place in the valley so if you are look for authent taiwanes food this is it howev you do need to come with time and some patienc the dish came out one at a time with long gap between each dish my friend and i pretti much finish the first dish intent leav a bit while we wait for our second dish to arriv after the second dish we had to wait again for our third dish

i will certain be back in a few week and hope they would have their act togeth by then

dear ownermanag i would high high recommend that you redo your menu to includ larger chines text and english wdescript  hire a staff who each have some degre of english profici although one of the server spoke english well the other did not in fact one of them could not even speak a word of englishok i admit there a littl prejudic against fc on my part even befor i walk in the door between it and steak 44 my mellow corner aj is a mere memori parkingtraff is now a total pain the ass

that said i thought id give it a whirl for lunch today on my day off i had to make a full circl through the lot befor find a singl space walk up i could alreadi hear the buzz of way too mani over excit femal voic ruh roh the line stretch well out the door but it did move quick employe are station at the doorway befor the regist to answer question a nice touch said help girl direct me to a littl side regist devot to take out 

to ahem ensur my experi was repres i splurg for the 3item mix  match a big ol drink and a browni after sampl one at the regist 23 ouch i had elbowsout tri to get through the crowd to the drink station ice tea lemonad etc predict mix of ladieswholunch hipster soccer mom fashionista in leather shirt and 2000 handbag femalemal ratio easili 41 if not higher the decor is a littl whitewashedmidwesternbarnch for my tast but it fit the name it quit open so the place is loud as fuck 

i bare had a chanc to get comfi on the big bench in the takeaway area befor my food was readi present in a brown paper bag with a cute artichok stamp on it a takeout menu thought place insid id just finish check out the cooler with togo drink mental scof at the 6 cold brew coffe and envis the idiot who would think it cool to drink coconut water right out of the coconut i fled the scene tri not to step on wayward children and hurri to my car as someon in a big suv stalk me for my space 

the verdict meh the dark green were veri salti veri the chili glaze sweet potato was decent with an unexpect pronounc citrus flavor not spici in the least the tofu well it is tofu definit noth special the clear winner was the sweet corn and quinoa my god strap a feed bag on me full of that shit and ill be good the portion are not as dismal as one might suspect from other review this will be two meal the browni was puzzl differ from the one id sampl earlier although id order the same type the one that came home with me was again heavili salt not bad just not expected

whil im impress by the effici of a restaur that is so new im not blown away by the food itself regardless i suspect i will end up here often becaus a it walk distanc from my hous b lot of vegetarian option and c easi for takeoutyes sam fox and his quest to be everyth to everyon  his knowledg of trend design acumen and flawless execut make him the slickest restauranteur this side of bobbi flay 

it is in that context that this place total beli it intend aim it portray itself as an altruist hippi enclav full of good vibrat peac and simpl whole grown fare  what you get is tawdri gossip from the villag ladi 17 protein bowl and a spot that is capit on the latest trend

dont get me wrong  my meal was tasti  but at that price and with that atmospher i would just assum eat a similar meal at a place like chop shop and donat the differ to the peopl republ of sustain nicaraguan coffe grower or whatev the whole food crowd caus is at the momentlocat right outsid of the mont carlo and next to doubl barrel roadhous spacious airi and bright insid with an outdoor patio area

youl see an assembl line of employe upon enter pick the pizza you want and ani add on are an addit 150 we got the margherita with ad rosemari ham mushroom and spinach as well as the carni with salsiccia pepperoni meatbal and rosemari ham with ad artichok also got the burrata with melon and proscuitto that come with bread pay up then youll get a number theyll call out when your order ready

verdict it was okay you get hint of wood burnt tast from the way it was made i appreci that although the carni surpass in flavor compar to the margherita tip the more add on the more difficult itll be for your pizza to hold up sinc it so thin the burrata was good prosciutto and the melon blend well but i dont think id get it again for the price

also got a glass of prosecco for 10 and a glass of beer for 9 they serv gelato too 

overal it was a good lunch although it was more on the pricier side when everyth total up would i come back mayb just becaus i have had better i admit while i was in a piec of carb heaven and even eat my date crust my mind and tast bud were think of how i couldnt help but compar it to settebello pizzeriamy wife and i tri this yesterday when we check in we were told there would be a 40 minut wait plus we also request the outdoor patio wed get call around 25 minut but they forgot about the patio request and want to seat us insid we eventu got the patio seat 
  onc seat servic was on the slow side we order drink i got the sammi hagar rum drink which was veri good but our order was not taken until we got our drink after a long wait  we order hamburg i got the mac and bacon burger i took about 30 min to come out the burger are smash burger style and unfortun our were on the over done side the burger is describ as an award win burger but not in this case the mac and chees was stingili appli and could not overcom the dryness of an overdon burger 

dure the whole time there when visit from the server were few and far between there were about six peopl get a tabl readi for a group of 15 must have been a vip becaus it was setup meticul ive never seen that much clean and recheck of the setup befor mayb if they put that much attent to the rest of the custom it would have been a better experi 

sinc it onli been open a week hope thing will get better but with so mani choic for good food in vega it hard to give place a second chancthis place has potenti a nice open seat area classic arcad game star war mrs pacman and a veri friend owner i think  the food look good and next time i will tri someth other than the gyro plate ok time out this greek restaur decid to american the name of thing such as grape leav instead of dolmad and lasagna instead of pastitsio  not sure if it is so peopl know what thing are call or becaus they make it differ   the plate lunch come with hummus pita gyro meat and salad type fixin for the gyro plus either fri or a salad  not bad for 11 dollar and chang  the food was veri fill  

i was disappoint with the gyro meat  although they shave it off the rotisseri machin it was actual quit dri and crunchyit also didnt have a lot of flavor especi on the lamb end of thing  

the sauc was decent but lack in the minti flavor im use to  the pita is a veri thin pita rather than thick one associ with american gyro  i prefer it that way

hop they will get the messag and find a way to get their meat a bit more flavor and moister  still if you are in the area it is nice to have choic nowi was beyond thrill  and no that not an exagger  to find a juic bar right outsid of my hotel a must for refuel after those long vega night 

asid from juic and smoothi they also offer freshjuic cocktail sangria and light bite 

they lack a varieti of fruit spice and other addon like garlic that most fullon juic bar offer and some of their juic were prebottl andor not organcame here for lunch out of the suggest by a friend locat on russel and rainbow it in a complex you dont realli expect there to be a restaur though russel is more busi nowaday but seem a littl weird spot to put a restaur 

when i had visit the restaur appar it didnt have a grand open yet lol oop 

was a littl skeptic when i first heard about this place bachi is associ with it popular two burger locat on the west and southeast side of town when i heard bachi and healthi i was like huhhhh how is that gonna work out 

servic was good quick brought to our tabl and given water grant they werent busi and appar they are open till onli 3pm and we were there at like 130pm 

was crave an egg benedict sinc i havent had it in a few year so was go between hlk surf n turf egg benedict and the corn beef hash as i said befor was crave for a egg benedict and it was suggest by the waiter as well 

hlk surf n turf egg benedict english muffin with poach egg scottish smoke salmon roast turkey tomato onion caper  dill hollandais grill asparagus  everyth was stack and present perfect egg were perfect over easi with an ooooozi yolk that run all over the stack when broken roast turkey was moist smoke salmon was not overpow and a perfect salti tomato and onion gave it a nice crisp flavor with the creami dill and caper hollandais sauc caper werent too overpow as well work well with the dill the english muffin was a littl soggi wish it was toast a littl more 

beignet with housemad strawberri guava jelli  onli 3 piec all in the shape of triangl beignet were littl crispi on the outsid and soft on the insid not realli similar to the usual beignet ive had in comparison to the one at downtown disney lol the housemad strawberri guava jelli was delici not too much guava flavor but pretti promin in strawberri accompani the beignet well 

the lone bird  ground chicken  turkey tsukun burger herb pesto lettuc tomato onion ring  friend order this no side of fri or anyth just a burger tho it has onion ring in it pretti big size he like it may tri this or the ostrich burger next time x first place in the usa that ive seen ostrich on the menu almost thought eat ostrich was illeg here lol ostrich is actual a red meat healthier and leaner than beef 

overal interest place iuno how much healthi it was they did have healthier option in comparison to their burger locat but to call the restaur healthi life was a littl out of the park i guess it was kind of like skinnyfat at least they have healthier option on the menuoh the bachi peopl master of take someth and make it expens i admit i was worri at first bachi burger to me is realli good at beautifi a burger with expert craftsmanship but still retain a goodbutnotenough flavor in other word they caus your eye to set an expect that the food cant meet luckili hlk is slight different

lik other have said i just dont see where the healthi part come in yes some thing are made with healthier option like coconut this and seed that but healthi no if the food here was healthi a complet differ crowd would be come the kind of crowd that doe not appreci oxtail burger and pancak but slice jicama instead

with that said we had

 beignet triangular ok unexpect serv with strawberri guava sauc tasti sauc but over breadi beignet not the fluffi and airi creation we were expect not bad but not worth a second look

 oxtail chili and jalapeno polenta with a slice of brioch im not total sure this dish make sens when you realli think about it this is the same oxtail chili youd find at bachi burger on top of fri now it on top of brioch which is on top of a veri pungent polenta i thought to myself is there blue chees in this but that not whi it off it off becaus everyth is soft there no contrast it chili on top of soft bread on top of mush that asid i actual enjoy it

 blueberri and flax seed pancak glutenfre color me surpris these were as soft and fluffi as a normal pancak full of gluten also they are huge i expect a modest stack of three instead i got plates cake that i wouldnt dare finish i never thought id say this but theyr almost too big anyway i order them with a coconut syrup and almond butter to my surpris both of them drizzl on top made the pancak even more delici this was a flavor win though i couldnt even tell there were flax seed in there not that it has to be in my face or anyth  and this could be a posit for some

oth than that servic was fine and the menu had some item recogniz from the burger joint there was a pretti vast select of interest sound drink as well id certain be back from what it sound like on their item descript they use pretti qualiti ingredi in everyth it impress but kind of overwhelm while tri to pick anyth at all

upd to comefirst off this smashburg sb is one of the onli in the valley where the ten percent 10 yelp checkin offer is not avail thank for noth tom ryan mayb the rent is too damn high doubt it 

second it is cute to see so mani student check this restaur out not sure where were they when it was a small local mexican restaur recent shutter but now it is a popular intern chain so they can be found stumbl over themselv to get over here from csn no not crosbi still  nash

now that i have state those two point  

smashburger
it is nice there is a place for a burger right near campus i cannot think of anoth option befor sb in ani case here we have one now 

there is not much to say about the food it is a chain for fuck sake the burger is the same here as it is at maryland parkway as it is in calgari alberta canada or in kuwait citi kuwait 

it is alright the fri are alright the shake are alright the ketchup packag is brilliant five 5 star for the ketchup packag  

the wait here seem to be intermin longer when compar to other sb locat i have been to for takeout mayb they need to work some kink out  i would hate for this locat to be the train facil or to appear to function as a train facil for the chain  but there was no queue when i have come here and yet i still have to wait a bit too long for my food 

i would take to the stopwatch to document precis how long they are take to get the food out but i would hate to be accus of be over pedant it is take long take my word for it 

or dont but you are the one that is go to be late to your class or back to work after lunch your firean innoc bystand walk in front of a doughnut shop after a stress experi of parallel park in downtown las vega  score a free box of o face doughnut your parent told you not to take anyth from a stranger when you were littl but your not a littl kid anymor so take all the free doughnuts

includ in my box were 4 mexican appl pie chocol blackberri chocol cake and one more doughnut that wasnt too memor they remind me of dunkin donut becaus theyr dri heavi and dens they were greasi too i do like the varieti of flavor flavor you might have had from pink box or in portland blue star except theyr not as wellexecuted

theyr new so they still have lot of room for improv ill be back in a few month and give them anoth shotitem selected

hav visit everi daniel boulud properti in new york citi from the eponym 3 dine room and it origin 1 café home to breakfast and brunch at bistro modern and sud respect it was with great delight that i learn of the chef return to sin citi  a new brasseri helm by former march bacchus chef david middleton schedul for dinner with two friend a tast menu presum prearrang by privat dine manag heidi voskuil  everi bit the bustl space suggest by it name with close set tabl and tradit heavi wood beneath the sexi glow of globe light it was just after 630pm on saturday when our parti was seat and start off with a stun riff on the bee knee our menu was confirmedat least conceptuallythough much of what follow was not exact what was request and much of it was mar by stillgreen servic  set asid small mistak on sourc and pronunci as well as beverag spill more than onc plus an obvious miscommun from front of hous to back about the menu request it was with a duo of boulud superl terrin that we began and with the foie gras smooth as silk while the chicken and pork pate up the ant with an earthi funk one can onli hope for this program to expand a bar boulud charcuteri program like that in manhattan theater district seem a perfect choic on the strip  move next to outsourc bread and salti butter befor progress into the onetwo punch of garlicki snail follow by the best scallop ive had in recent memori as the restaur fill to perhap 80 capac it was in our fourth cours that thing got interest the light sear lamb and it spici sausag tender and delici but serv as our main cours when my request had clear delin the duck as a must  eventu serv the confit after much hemmingandhaw includ the involv of the dine room manag suffic it to say that the crispyskin fowl is absolut worth visit and perhap fight for and finish the even with a glut of sweet plus a quintet of awardwin chees one can onli hope the servic can soon keep up with the kitchennot onli doe chef middleton cuisin warrant it but so doe the textbook gateau basquit will take no time at all to notic how nice the peopl are here they told us they use to run a busi in virginia for decad do the same thing how cool if their menu is the same as in virginia it would explain the whitewash ill be describing

th menu is massiv it most thai food with a smatter of other cultur here and there there are too mani choic overwhelm eventu it was settl to get some classics

 spici eggplant and basil with chicken this was order at a medium level of spici but came out as mild sauceheavi and flavorlight it has the right basil flavor in the sauc but it just too much liquid and not enough ingredi qualiti of everyth includ was stellar though noth was overcook white meat chicken fresh eggplant good basil

 lemongrass chicken this was also at a medium level of spici accord to them but realli just mild veri sauci with light lemongrass flavor this is unusu light becaus of all the lemongrass present again the same chicken fresh bell pepper and carrot thank cook just enough to keep crispi qualiti but small in portion

 complimentari salad with hous dress this was a simpl salad top with a honeysesam oiltomato dress made inhous yum

get the gist sauci mild fresh small portion and yet expens about 1112 a plate this is just too much unfortun i would have expect a much larger dish without compromis the qualiti and integr of the ingredients

com back here would be easi at the right price even without the authent im use to in some other thaiorient spot in town but until then im hesit qualiti and servic is spoton but the price point just kill iti love their food idea there menu is a foodi paradis but execut is poor need a lot of refin more trial and error locat is veri conveni for my famili and im a big fan of breakfast food but ill let them workout their kink let the cook get familiar with the menu itemsetc 
definit worthi of anoth visit but would like to enjoy a dish to it full potentired velvet pancak are great i would definit order again i did love the top creation for orang creamsicl the pineappl and banana foster but the pancak fell flat liter they were more dens than fluffi for me at first i thought mayb they were new crew in kitchen but ive tri three differ time alreadi and each time same thing red velvet is a differ batter than the other im guess becaus textur wise outer layer has a slight crisp   nutella one is too dri need fruit and there is an extra charg for fruit the pancak are standard size short stack portion was enough for me   take into consider i am compar their pancak to 808s egg n thing so my expect are a bit unrealist i guess if you havent tri the pancak in hawaii these are good enough like i said i love the top creation and syrup use here 

other savori dish so far i like although it doesnt take much effort to fri up portugues sausag spam and egg garlic fri rice is good with loco moco  but the other filipino restaur around the corner make a killer adobo loco moco the chili breakfast skillet tast good but not enough chili and certain not worth pay almost nine dollar for it i realli want to love this place but so far it fall short food wise  sigh

servic is great love the ambianc of this place with the island regga jam play in the background the time ive been here it hasnt been too busi so if you wake up earli enough you wont have ani troubl wait for a tabl like their other restaur they do implement the no reserv and they wont seat you till everyon in your parti is present 

i still have yet to make it through the rest of the menu 38 for now  i still have yet to tri their lemon ricotta pancak  mayb that will send it over a solid four star worthi rate for mei have to admit i havent been the biggest fan of babystack so when my og want to check this place out now that theyv open a locat closer to him i was reluct but alway up a food expedition

w arriv on memori day and it was not busi we were seat quick and i decid to final order the adobo omelet ive had my eye on for a while the rice was flavor but just a littl on the dri side i would have probabl prefer if it was just the rice and skip the egg but i enjoy it 

i also order the red white and blue pancak that were on special for the day top with blueberri strawberri and whip cream i wish i had gone with my first instinct and ask that they forego the white chocol chip the pancak wouldv been better without them the pancak were good but like the other locat they are small and not veri fluffi they did tast good however

w had a good meal and i got to spend time with some of my favorit peopl so that a plus it a good addit to this locat and i see them be success hereyelp 365 challeng 2014165365 foodartmusicentertainment

buncha negat nanci i tell you

read the reviews

 this place need work  no st sherlock all new busi do

 the music is too loud  buy earplug then

 the food is pricey  um your on the strip so yeah of cours it is

great concept here and theyll onli get better with time it isnt 100 fulli open yet so give fame time fukuburg follow and beard papa fan dont seem to have a problem person i would never buy anyth from the ramen or chines spot nor would i buy a boba drink out of a machin know that there better qualiti and select in nearbi chinatown hope beard papa open up other locat around town but until then ill be frequent fame whenev a cream puff crave hitseven more than sprinkl     aloha


shaka meter  uuu  uuu  uuu  uu  35i pass by here on the way to winco and notic this place is open now  there a drive thru and you can take your order to go or you can dine in the price are reason i order an 8 piec meal which came with 8 piec of chicken 1 larg side and four biscuit just under 15 the chicken onli is 1039  got the mild flavor for mr b i tast one wing and my thought are it okay noth special they dont measur up to the one i get over at johnni mac that for sure  i like the skin though it had a nice  crunch a slight garlic tast to it the biscuit are pretti good  butteri the potato with gravi is good my famili like it im a fan of their sweet tea though

servic wise everybodi is still green there was a slight confus with my order i was given a receipt and the number on cash receipt is differ from the number for the chicken order that the cashier never hand to me so i wait there for a while becaus number i had wasnt be call until they figur  out 5 minut later  

park lot is realli small on the drive thru side there onli one way to get out it could be a pain in the butt tri to get out of there when it realli busy

for the price valu of the meal and for the conveni it great for families

not lobbi close  and stop take order at 10pm but you can still get fri chicken till 11pm when you take your car through the drivethru windowim go to say this i will come back in a coupl of week to see how thing are go but first let me prais the staff to the high heaven unlik a lot of new place downtown they dont assum your go to just drink the koolaid they were ernest in their desir to make sure we were comfort and happi with our food they seem to have actual tast most of the food and had good recommend for us much like la comida id eat here again regardless of what i thought of the food becaus the staff made the experi worthwhil fyi i dont care for the food at la comida 

the food well we split oxtail risotto which honest was so rich as to be offput i ate mayb four spoon as did my lunch date there was plenti left to take home but we pass we also had the bacon jam with brie it was actual delish but again a littl went a long way a veri long way again we pass on take the extra home the empanada were fill with nice chunki meat that was tender though it couldv been a tad juicier the mushroom flatbread was a great appet and the pizza cook was lot of fun without be over familiar

her my issu and it someth you can actual see in the accompani pictur the risotto and jam seem to be swim in someth it wasnt greas mayb some oil like truffl the lake of whatev it was did not inspir one to want to deal with that in a to go box or when it inevit congeal again offput is the onli word i can find to describ my feel about it it realli wasnt greasi or slimi but it look that way combin with the fact that everyth except the empanada was just way too rich mean i wont be push this as a place to go not yet 

im sure that carson kitchen will find it feet veri soon and hope so i like the vibe even if the decor look like someon went to eat and decid that the new downtown vega hip eateri look serious it almost look like a blatant rip off they seem to be work on an outsid patio which in and of itself will get me back this summer and not to be petti i give it point for be fill with adult not a bunch of beard wannab 

the price seem a tad ambiti for small plate you can go from a quick bite to a 50 lunch in no time not outrag but probabl not in my let run by for a nosh price range

i look forward to sampl more of carson kitchen soon but im hope they bring the ooz down a notch go check it out for yourself it worth a tri good luck carson kitchen welcom downtownmercadito is a fenc sitter

loc insid red rock casino just about 50 yard from yard hous mercadito is a mexican theme tapa restaur that has come to las vega from new york and chicago 

this is a fenc sitter review whi you ask well when restaur open there bound to be a few hiccup along the way when we walk in we were sat to a tabl prompt unfortun the tabl we sat at was realli made for peopl from the hobbit the layout of the busi is quit nice and has an array of seat option but to seat 2 guy who well over 6 foot at kiddi tabl was a littl strang we were told though that the small tabl will be chang in a few days

a for the menu it has nice rang of item to choos from we went for the guac and chip carn taco and pastor taco all were pretti dam amaz absolut someth i can recommend a few kink here and there but for sure a place well worth visit i will also say for mexican food it is a littl pricey but kinda worth it

overal

come back yesin the area for an event at the linq and rememb they were offer buy one get one free origin cream puff 

they are current onli offer vanilla fill so i was stuck with this option despit know i like wouldnt enjoy it vanilla and cream fill isnt my favorite

they fill as you order and our puff were readi quick the pastri was light and fluffi and as expect i didnt enjoy the fill i know these are suppos to be subtl and not over sweet but i find the puff and fill a littl on the sweet side for my tast i typic like veri subtl dessert so i was surpris that these didnt do it for me i have tri beach papa befor in southern california and i wasnt in love then either so mayb it just me 

i am interest in tri their other flavor when they becom avail but for the price and locat i dont see myself make ani special effort to give it anoth trihope this place get better and better as time pass solid 4 star for the food but gotta give them a 2 for servic at my first visit

tri to call in food for i onli have a 30 min break but phone line onli kept ring 
sinc it veri close to work i didnt think it would take ani longer than 15 min to get in and get out boy was i wrong 
3540 minut wait for my greek salad and hanger steak two ladi that may have been there way longer befor me didnt get their food until 20 min of put my order in
may i add that the three of us were the onli custom there 

one thing i notic was quit a hand of peopl walk in to ask for a physic menus but pc did not have them yet  
so they had walk out

let talk food 
6 greek salad  cowork had this item huge portion fresh and tasti except the fact that they forgot the vinaigrett   
14 hanger steak chimichurri  come truffl isra couscous risotto style steak was tender cook proper and the couscous was creami i did find the chimichurri to have tast more like pesto 

overal satisfi with the food but i was just disappoint of the long wait i get the whole soft open train theyr new part but 35 min is just way too long

il be give them anoth chanc in a month or so
