today is sunday and i arriv around 8am i usual tri to get there kind of earli and leav befor it get busi so im not take up a tabl i bought a big breakfast as describ abov and sat down to work just over an hour later i was approach by a middleag man whom i assum is the owner or manag but whom ive never seen befor he ask if i was awar of their new polici about wifi on sunday morn and how they dont want peopl just hang out use the internet when it get crowd no sugar coat that almost verbatim what he said for the record i wasnt actual use their wifi i was write whatev his point was obvious i stare at him for a few second becaus i couldnt believ that a proprietor was actual ask me a pay custom to leav when i had been there onli an hour and in fact still had toast on my plate he suggest it was fine for now but that when it start to get crowd i should get out i said that if that how they felt i would leav now and he respond that exact how we feel i was shock and still am i have never never been treat so disrespect in a place of busi and im a regular pay custom i alway leav a tip i still cant believ i was treat this way

i will no longer recommend this place now that theyv shown their true color if the food was except i might tri to swallow my pride but it realli noth special there are sever other breakfastcoffe shop in the area includ a starbuck across the road and i will be patron them instead from now onif i could give no star this would be the place that deserv it  we were in on a thursday night at around 7pm  there were a hand of patronscertain more staff than pay custom  there was one bartend who was bother to make drink  we watch him make a moijto and when he pour from the shaker to the glass he spill some over includ a lime and some mint that went onto the bar he pick them up and put them back into the cup  disgust then the 4 of us at the bar were readi to order anoth round and the bartend went mia we wave down 2 waitress who went into the back and we never saw them again 10 minut later he came back and when ask what happen to you he respond i am busi i need to clean the keg line 

dont wast you time hereif i could give the harmoni less than one star i would i live in the shenkatwood neighborhood so im not write as an outsid ive been to the harmoni mani time but im final done be abus by the notori unfriend owner bartend and waitstaff at the harmoni the harmoni is wors than seinfeld soup nazi becaus there no ironi or humor in be treat the way the employe here treat their custom 

i wont get into specif i can onli say that i take pride in my neighborhood my wife and i frequent those establish that understand that they are part of a communiti and treat their pay custom as such the harmoni is a black mark on our neighborhood and i am asham that unsuspect visitor to the quaint east side should have to endur the abus disrespect and general unapologet servic at this establish if you scroll down youll read other comment about the owner girlfriend who is now manag the last time i was in there with a group of friend she couldnt have been more rude or insult when we all said we wouldnt be back she mere shrug her shoulder 

if your visit the east side there are plenti of other place that serv great food with friend servic alchemi mickey wilson the weari travel all come to mind as place that will make you feel and tast the love on the east side  if your a masochist be sure to head on over the harmoni for your daili dose of abus 

youv been warn you certain wont catch me sit at this bar ever againif ever there were a real live grinch it would be the hag presum the manag work 2 day befor christma  i was go to buy a bottl of wine and she came over to let me know in a nasti voic that if i were buy alcohol i better hurri up

wel i did and becaus the cashier was serious slow it was 901 when it was my turn at the regist  this woman came over and snatch the bottl away from the cashier and said someth to the effect that i should have hurri up and they didnt sell alcohol after 9  the cashier look realli uncomfort and mumbl some excus  

what is it about the holiday that turn peopl into complet assholfirst off love wild thaiger food is excel servic is by in larg prompt courteous and a relax atmospher 

howev i had a bad experi where i wit a cockroach walk across the bar in front of me i voic my concern to ola she couldnt find it but apolog i was dissatisfi with this respons and wrote her an email express my concern this is her appropri profession abbrevi response

a a regular you know we have an a rate becaus we dont have a pest problem  i will be glad to share the pest inspect report and month servic schedul for the last eight year which we have been in busi  it would be a perfect world if i could afford to have enough staff to open all of our box in the park lot and stock all of our product individu to ensur that unwant pest do not enter our door of cours we have discontinu purchas product from the supplier and they are awar of the problem

sh refund my money and were satisfi move on 

i show up today with my partyand she pull me out of the restaur tell me that im not support her busi and that a few day after my email she get an inspect from the maricopa counti health depart and they gave her a b rate she proceed to accus me of call them and blame me for her low grade i inform her that i dealt with her straight communic direct with her and i consid it resolv at this point she tell me she wont serv me anymor after be a custom for about seven years

hav never dealt with the maricopa environment servic im not realli awar with how they schedul their inspect but clear it was a coincid that it occur 6 day later i guess ola never thought perhap it was a differ custom or in fact that mayb it was schedul everi 3 months

at ani rate her reaction to custom feedback is not onli unprofession but just make bad busi sens 

poor decis ola im realli surpris your sanit problem and fail an inspect is blame on your customafter read all the other review of this place i have determin one thing you all were obvious on crack when you ate here or mayb they gave you crack when you ate hereeith way my experi was not the same

w at about 400 on a saturday not a busi time for a restaur so i wasnt scare away when we were the onli one in the entir place next time ill make sure to think twice

they start us off with chip and salsa and im rather shock that no one has mention their chip are a total fail salsa was decent but the chip were an assort of sweet potato chip stale blue corn chip sweet fri chip sugar and everyth and stale normal tortilla chip all in one bowl if they werent stale the blue corn and normal chip would have pair nice with the salsa but rubberi sweet potato dont get me wrong i like sweet potato  and sugar coat with salsa really

w decid that we were go to order an appet and then a meal to split and i love a good artichokeanyth so i order the artichok dip when it came out like 20 minut later i had to ask them if they brought us the right dish it was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard i search there was not an artichok to be found they didnt bring us ani other chip to go with it and let me tell you sweet potato chip and queso dont go so great togeth to make it wors the menu said it was 699 but they charg us 779 if it was good i wouldnt have care so much about 080 as i do

i thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet but they couldnt even do that right they brought out corn and flour tortilla with the fajita word of advic if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the troubl and get the flour the corn one were so wet that they liter tore to shred when i tri to peel them off each other there wasnt a whole lot of beef in the beef fajita either and what was there was lack in good flavor and for the soup half moon sport grill make a better tortilla soup than this placeand theyr a sport grill 

overal food was bad servic was veri slow consid we were the onli one there and i would never ever eat here again did i mention they didnt give us silverwar we had to go steal it off anoth tablnot just the worst servic but no servic at all

what was onc a perfect fine establish has taken a major declin this year ive been go here for the past three year to watch the packer on game day the food has alway been except and the servic wonderful

thi year it suck far below accept levels

two week ago we sat at our tabl and we wait 40 minut until we saw our server and this onli after my girlfriend went to the bar and explain our situation

thi week i sat down in a spare popul bar and after not be given a menu ask for a drink order or even acknowledg i decid not to go to the bar and wait and see just how long this would last i watch an entir three quarter of a footbal 2 hour without ever so much as be acknowledg as exist when i sat down tabl next to me was cover with the last custom leftov and was not clear until right befor i left by what i assum was my waiter in do so he walk right past me and my empti tabl twice never to return

utt pathetstay away far away

i had been hear about fate for a while i had high expect sinc i had been to lucki dragon in the past the owner prev joint which was ok

it was the worst chineseasian ive had in az the servic was terribl the chair uncomfort and to top it off my fiance got food poison and has been sick for the last 2 day from it i took her to the er this morn at 430 am and decid to final start post on yelp sinc ive been a lurker for a while

aesthetics
initi look like a typic hipster restaur like you might find in anoth citi nice patio cool insid  howev the seat at a bus stop is more comfi there is no chair back  just this high bar thing that dig into your back

im go to file this under aesthet  we order the hot and sour soup more on that later and the waitress suggest it was larg enough to share howev they appar dont have ani kind of serv utensil so we had to use our littl soup spoon to serv ourself soup into anoth bowl out of this wide shallow terrin wtf

service
i dont know a nicer way to say it our waitress was a dopey bimbo it took 20 minut for her to take our order she went miss for long period of time when i had an empti water glass and then for a while longer after i track her down and ask for some not good

food
i ran into a friend there and he comment at how he love the food and was surpris we didnt like it to be blunt it was utter crap 

the hot and sour soup was thin and spici that it it tast like chile and a splash of rice wine vinegar no other flavor present it not like ani hot and sour soup i ever had in a bad way there are these weird chewi dumpl like thing in it that would be better serv at protect the floor from your chair leg 

i order some saigon basil someth or other dish with beef she order the lemon grass whatev with tofu
mi dish was bad the beef was slice thin but tough and chewi and total lack flavor as for basil there were 2 small basil leav in the dish and that it the sauc was thin and one dimension 

her lemon grass dish was also bad the sauc tast like tom yum past from the chines groceri store mix with some water i felt bad for the poor abus tofu

im not a big fan of chain restaur but pei wei and pickup stick are about 10x better in term of food qualiti and tast screw that even the chines place in the mall food court is better i am not exagger it was a veri disappoint meal

now for the nasti part
i drank water  fiance unit drank th green tea it was like no other green tea i ever had seen it was leprechaun green with some kind of milk like substanc in iti thought it look kinda funki but she drank it

it was the onli differ between our meal i tri her she tri mine etc i didnt drink the scienc experi tea

wel sever hour later she start have stab stomach pain she spent the whole night up vomit and with diarrhea  2 day later the vomit has subsid but shes miss 2 day of school and is still poop up a storm i took her to the er at 430 am this morn and they confirm the symptom were consist with food poison admit she had just gotten back a 45 day ago from a trip to a 3rd world countri where she got and recov from a tropic diseas so her immun system is not at it strongest right now but come on this shouldnt be the end result plus this is downtown phoenix so there are plenti of peopl around with compromis immun system if you know what i mean due to lifestyl choices

ther is some great asian food in central phoenix 

maxim and da vang are great vietnames place on 19th ave
th cultur center has a few great place esp golden buddha 
thai lahna has been consist good for years
lik i said i dont eat a lot of chain food  but even the pei wei at 7th ave and mcdowel is way better in term of food qualitii havent yelp in about 2 month and i was wait for a place to either wow me or disgust me  well this place was that bad 

first impress were all right  the outsid bar was neat w good view of downtown and the fire pit were nice  no beer on tap though and serious what with the hiphop club dj at 700 pm  come on guy way too earli for that

it wasnt too long befor three of us were seat and after about 10 minut our waitress came up and ask us whether we were readi to  oh wait that right no menus yet good job  ok so i order the thai spring roll which had a fill of lettuc a singl strip of carrot and noodl  serious  main cours i order the curri which turn out to be the worst curri in the world  i dont even know if it was curri it was more like a bowl of thick yellow soup with a few piec of chicken and a coupl of veget toss in  yuck  and then they onli gave me a tini bowl of rice  im sorri isnt it suppos to be the other way around  my friend complet agre with how bad the place was i think they had some sort of stir fri which they said was bland and pointless

so yeah i dont recommend this place  instead head a block over to the roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretti good foodfrom the street my husband and i thought zoe kitchen would be like panera  that is we thought it would serv fast flavor and goodqual lunch fare none of these adject turn out to be an accur descriptor in fact the food at zoe kitchen took 30 minut to come out and was disgust bland and in a few case quit gross 

we stop in for lunch last week the place was pack but the line to order move quick so we incorrect assum that we would also get our food quick more on that in a second in term of the menu we were shock at how uninterest the menu option seem even though the menu was decent size and we are open to lot of differ type of food and flavor we found ourselv complet unabl to choos and not drawn to ani individu option 

even though im not a vegetarian i prefer lunch sandwich with no meat so i was also quit irrit that the onli vegetarian sandwich were the grill chees and grill feta this is 2008 and the nonmeat option at a lunch spot should be more imagin than chees slap on some bread in the end i still end up order the grill chees noth els sound good and my husband select the greek chicken marinara 

we sat down at the tabl display our number card and just wait and wait and wait after liter wait for 25 minut i check in with the assist manag who was man the pickup counter she went into the kitchen check on our order and said it would be just a few more minut she even had a server bring us two slice of chocol cake as some sort of  token of their sympathi but it was superdri and total gross thank but no thank im just glad we didnt pay 2 for each slice

it wasnt until 10 minut later when i lost my patienc and told the same server that we want our food immedi that we final receiv it we have a higherthanaverag awar of the difficulti of work in food servic but we found it unaccept that a nonfullservic restaur would take 35 minut to bring us two sandwich if they cant handl the cater togo and eatin order volum they should hire more staff member 

as if the slow servic wasnt pain enough my grill chees was complet char liter burn and black after one bit of the accompani slaw which was soak in mayonnais and soggi i  immedi walk back to the assist manag hand her the plate and ask her to refund me for my plate to her credit she compli but the wait had alreadi been so egregi that i wasnt about to just write the long wait and gross food off and decid to return 

mi husband greek marinara was not as terribl but was still bland and complet unmemor the bread was a plain roll the chicken breast strip were form and tast total process and the greek marinara tast like prego the onli tasti part of his meal was the side of bag chips

i guarante you that we wont be back to zoe kitchen we are huge fan of fast casual and fresh lunch food but we found the food at zoe to be anyth butjordan has been close for 34 year now much to my dissapoint becaus i alway enjoy go here for lunch and get their tostadas

rip jordanive been to this locat more time than i could ever count it has alway been my go to but 10 for a combo meal hoooli moli price have gone up and absolut noth has chang i truli cant believ how bad this place has becom over the year the young cashier girl was so rude she was almost annoy that we were come in to spend 24 on lunch the peach cobbler was terribl i had to scrap the bottom of the crock pot thing to get some extra bbq sauc im so disappoint everi time i go in it just get wors and wors there are so mani other wonder place to eat in downtown phoenix honey bear your just make it easier and easier to get els wherethis is legit i order combo 2 at 245 pm 3114 and at 340 pm i had to walk to the counter and ask how much longer my food was go to be the repli was 5 minut there is one order ahead of you
no i am sorri for the wait let me see what take so long nothing
i repli with you have three minut or i want a refund well 5 goe by ok i want a refund it took about anoth 5 minut for him to get permiss from his manag whom may or may not have even graduat high school at this point i have been rob 1 hour of my life with no apolog with no interact with manag or ani  sens of custom servic  
there would be a zero star here if i had the option absolut yummi food when proper servic 
i mean their was not one singl resembl of an adult in this establish it like they all got high in the back and had no sens of time or surround i understand if you have a few new peopl that you are train but wtf
oh and on the way out some one told me calm downm calm down you rob my of an hour of my life made me hungrier than what i was and told me to calm down that is not how you deescal a situat 
never again honey bear will i treat you to my hard earn money and frank the gentleman befor me should have been more furious than me he call in his order and sandwich with whatev side you hand him a bag with a side of sauc no apolog for him or ani of your other loyal custom dam i am mad
                                    thank for noth 
                                                       augustina aka robthis was my first time to this place and probabl the last when you walk in to ani servic busi you expect a certain amount of kind and profession well not here we were met with a rude cashier who kept scream next as if there was no one in line next i saw all these sign tell you what you cant do in this place like do not dump anyth in the soda dispens drain and check your order befor you leav and so on final when we were abl to place a order the extrem rude cashier seem so irrit that we actual had the nerv to enter this place that she had no desir to even take our order or answer ani question that we had the price was decent but on the expens side 20 dollar for 2 peopl without drink so we final get our order and know that i have to check my bag becaus i read the sign that had it print in bold letter i notic that i was miss my potato salad so the rude cashier look over and say what and i said im miss my potato salad so she open the cooler and basic throw it at me with veri good accuraci as if she has done this mani time so then my brother ask her if she miss his potato salad also and she scream out i dont know check your bag as if she has somehow forgotten what she put in there 30 second ago 

bottom line food is good but it not worth the effort you have to go through to get it the staff is so bad that i will go out of my way to go somewher els the owner should be awar that the servic of this place has gotten to the point that peopl wont even go there so they dont have to deal with the worst servic they have ever had in today economi where peopl are choos care where to spend their money you need to have someth special and this place should put up a big sign that says

go away we dont want your money

they will never get anymor of minemu shu was close so we gave this place a tri for takeout sunday and asian food i know im asian

it took about 10 minut for our actual waiter to come to ask us what we want to drink still he answer our question well even if they didnt turn out to be 100 factual he help stear our decis there were spici honey wing that we were interest in but i cant stand the chilli vinegar tastesmel of buffalo saucei ask him is it light on the buffalo and heavi on the honey he answer yes incorrect probabl the strongest buffalo tastingsmel chicken ive even been close to i had to push it further to the other side of the tabl to keep my eye from watering

th enddownhil  ive been eat at luke a few time a month sinc 1996  over the last few year it slowli been go downhil  their signatur italian beef sandwich are often serv bare warm or cold  the extrem hard crust french bread use to be dip in au ju gravi to soften them up and load the sandwich with flavor  now no matter how you order it extra gravi wet etc the sandwich come out almost complet dri and is guarante to destroy the roof of your mouth

im realli disappoint to see a restaur ive had so mani good lunch wither away but even their health inspect have made dine here riski at best  httpwwwmaricopagovenvsvcenvwebapptabsresultsaspxnavigatedfrombusinessresultsdrilldownmcpermid11712businesslukes20restaurantaddress1602202020e2020indian20school20rdpermitidsg13198

al this and their price have been skyrocket  save your money and your health and go somewher elsthis has been one of my regular spot for italian beef sinc the 90s  my trip today will be my last   luke use to have their own beef that was tasti  well today they use some frozen vienna beef that was like rubber tast was not near the same and the color was off  this made me sad sinc ive been a long time custom  this isnt the first exampl of them cheapen out  i guess i will have to go through the troubl of make my own italian beef and will have to find a good jar giardinieraso ive been go to this place for year not bc the food blow my mind but rather it hit the spot plus i love sit on the patio drink wine when the weather is nice with my best gal 

anyhow my other best gal my mom had never tri this spot i  thought duck would be great for a quick casual lunch shes a vegetarian so we order the where the beef sandwich to share it took about 20 minut to make the sandwich which feel like an etern when your hungry

when i glanc at the sandwich i thought perhap they had ad some portobello mushroom to it turn out the dark brown layer was actual rotten avocado realli i mean come on avocado is like prime rib to vegetarian how can you f this up it was truli nasti it got me to think if someon actual put this into the sandwich what els would their low standard allow them to place into an unsuspect victim sammi it not like they make them with blindfold on i was realli gross out

when i brought it to the manag attent she didnt seem that bother by it they remad half a sandwich for me and that was that

it was annoy bc i left feel that duck  decant take for grant the fact that loyal custom will stick with them no matter what well not this one

plus that place need a serious dust yuckthis was the worst experi ever in a restaurant

first the servic was lackadais at best  it was veri slow to have our order taken and it took almost 40 minut from the time we order to get our food the food itself was tasti enough onc it final arrived

howev the worst part about this meal was the cockroach that we discov on the wall over our tabl  immedi my friend and i began to point at it and talk loud we tri to get the attent of waitstaff for sever minut  final the cockroach fell onto our tabl that was it we leapt out of the booth and exclaim cockroach is this the worst part of the visit  no  waitstaff then came over pull back the tabl squash the cockroach and then gestur for us to resum our meal and said cockroach gone 

at least the manag comp the meal  but  if there is one cockroach allow to crawl around the dine room tabl i can onli imagin what the kitchen might look like i definit cant imagin go backlet me start of by say i love food great servic i like to share the enorm portion serv in restaur drink water with lemon and i do not drink alcohol beverag  i know i scream cheapskat but i think i deserv a decent 25 star experi at least for the food  most place meet or exceed my expect  guisepp did not 

and there come a time when my youth ethnic appear water with lemon request to share and sober live is met with that i am not go to make money off of you vibe from the owner  it hasnt happen in a veri long time but guisepp prove their still is bad servic reserv for their unwant patrons

i was veri excit to eat here see it on diner drivein and dive on food network my favorit food network show and see all of the new time best of award  got there at 830pm friday night there were peopl wait outsid thought it was a good sign  now i thought be in a strip mall next to the water n ice store the servic would be warm and welcom and the place would be chock full of nondbag  i am alway cool wait a bit for good food but be stare down by rich overweight women with their husband in flip flop cargo short and afflict tee and teenag platinum blond with their smug smile boyfriend in their flip flop plaid short and afflict tee is never my cup of tea

fast forward 30 minut of this ish we get seat anoth 10 minut menus anoth 10 minut a water and a water down gross ice tea which they charg us for even though she took it back and gave him water and by 930pm we get our 15dollar saltysaltysalti bolognes ragu with overcook spaghetti we didnt get the homemad pasta to share 4dollar babi 12 inch thin toastett and 2dollar marinara bowl for dip   fyi this is an italian restaur that not onli make you pay for an ounc of bread they also charg for extra virgin oliv oil

so go to guisepp if you like

eh italian food
cold and dri humor from the owner

part of their review on 3912 state also  if 50 dollar is to expens for you after have 2 soda especi the delici lemonad who are from franc so they are more expens then a can of coke 2 meal and 2 dessert then mcdonald is better for youpric wise of cours 

after review their review i was shock to see how they think about their custom  how 2 face can you get  nice in the privat messag and then blast a custom on a public review  if i would have had 2 drink 2 meal and 2 dessert for 50 that is a great deal  we had 5 nonalcohol drink 4 dessert and a cooki for 4850  you know we should have taken the kid to mcdonald for dessert  

to read the rest of frenchi bs review  httpwwwyelpcombizaupetitfourscottsdalehridb6f4kzsk5apkwzxlumtsaok i am not one that know her sushi well but when i order a roll that said that is come with crab cream chees cucumb and avocado whi am i get a roll with just whitefish

i hate to write a negat review for a place that use to be an old neighborhood favorit  but if your loyal custom just stop show up  never critic your perform you can t fix it 

so here my father word of wisdom that you wont get in ani busi school 
peopl go where they are invit they stay where they feel welcomed

hava java stop invit  welcom custom when it start put offens sign on the bathroom door and then password protect it free wifi servic with password like buy coffe it seem that hava java lost the hunger to be a superior establish by have better tast product at a competit price and give their custom a better experi than their competitors

hava java  use to be a great place to hang out or for a cup of coffe in the arcadiacamelback area but it seem in the past coupl of year the place has consist slip and it is share the faith of anoth onc upon a time great coffe hang out at the biltmor area the coffe plantatthe wrigley mansion is one of a few histor venu in a citi that doe not valu it past and histori that said you would think that fact would guarante a top qualiti meal and fine dine experi at geordi restaur regrett geordi turn out to be no better than ani other overlyhyp but underwhelm restaur one would find at a 4 or 5star resort

i have live in the valley for near 10 year and last night was the first time i had ever visit the wrigley mansion i alway felt somewhat guilti for never have visit but i can say with near 100 certainti that my first visit is also my last the servic and wait staff perform well but the food was the equival of one might get at applebe and certain not worth what i paid

i start off with the carpaccio which was probabl the most disappoint part of the meal i have had some mediocr carpaccio befor but never this poor prepar i suspect a bad cut of beef i also order a side of their white truffl fri that arriv with excess garlic the fri themselv were overcook and tast like jack in the box fri generous amount of catsup were requir to make them somewhat edibl for the entré i tri the serverrecommend lamb chop which i request to be prepar medium when it arriv it was clear not medium the meat was tough and lack ani flavor and the au jus was entir too salty

th beverag servic was quit prompt howev i think the bartend should go back to mixolog school the manhattan i order had too much vermouth and hard ani bitter while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter

th purpos of the even was to celebr a friend birthday so our dinner parti had a whole room to ourselv given the size of the parti the wait staff did do an excel job of make sure we were well serv our glass were never empti and the food did arriv prompt unfortun that alon could not make up for the poor food qualiti and exorbit pricei went to jerri last night for dinner  we alway eat there and usual like the atmospher  this time there were protest there with antinazi sign  they told me that a man was present sign book and speak to a group of peopl  his name is david irv and he was invit to speak by the group about his belief that the holocaust didnt happen  and that hitler never knew about the jew be slaughter  this is sick and made me lose my appetit  whi would a restaur like jerri support a local neonazi group  appar they hold the month meet of the group there as well  i do not plan to return to this locat for ani meal in case i run across this type of hatr again
4912 sinc that time i have been follow the stori of david irv  he has not return to this restaur again but went to a hotel near the airport mayb a year later  it was guard by the phx polic red squad  at least the protest wack this mole back into his hole for nowlet me prefac this review by say two thing 1 if there was an option for negat star id give it and 2 i just ate there about 20 minut ago and am still feel piss off my husband and i were in the mood for a good breakfast this morn so we got to thinkingmatt matt is alway awesom but we didnt feel like wait out in the rain for over an hour the origin pancak hous it a close second so we opt for that and head out onc we got there we realiz 350 other peopl had the same idea as us and the wait would be about an hour not feel like wait we hop back in the car and jump on our phone to check out what yelp thought would be good nearbi linda was one of the place that pop up along our drive and we had both pass it a few time alway talk about want to tri it we look at the review and there were lot of good one rave about the food realli guy who said it was matt with pie realli i dont know where the hell you get off but im hold you partial respons for total jack up my sunday breakfast we got insid and the place is a real shithol i dont mind becaus i typic love eat at shadi look place and drink in dive bar it like a real slice of life type of thing and i find the experi usual excel where the decor is lack everyth was blue and mauvei havent seen this much mauv sinc the late 80s and again that would usual be fine except in this case it doesnt look like anyon has clean the place sinc then either everywher i look thing were grimi and just notclean we sat at the counter first mistak and both order the jjs special second mistak sit at the counter was like have a backstag pass to a michael bolton showor some other realli shitti person you would never want to see backstag we could see the entir oper and hear the cook bitch the whole time that right i said cook singular one person work in the kitchen she came out a few time to yell at our server call linda i sincer hope it was not the owner linda she look like the grandma from napolean dynamit for those of you that get the refer enough said we could hear the ding of microwav oven and the grumbl of napolean dynamit grandma in the weed with ticket that she couldnt read due to linda suppos shitti handwrit we wait over a half hour for our food grant we didnt have to wait to sit but serious a half hour for egg bacon and pancak when the food came out i was alreadi over it i took one look at the plate and knew this was not go to be good my overeasi egg had total runni white and look more like a sunnysideup gone wrong my bacon look like it came from frys and the pancak were the onli edibl thing on my plate i dont know if they were edibl becaus everyth els was so total shitti or if it was becaus i am 9 month pregnant and would have eaten shit cake at that point nevertheless the ambianc combin with the servic and the food made for the absolut worst 28 ive ever spent on breakfast 28 dollar for me and my husband to have pancak egg bacon and coffe that did not includ toast or potato and half the plate was ined it make my blood boil just think of it and as i sit here write i am still starv we should have just gone to the brass rail better servic better food qualiti i am not joke and it would have been 550 a person for the same meal you fool me onc linda shame on me you wont be fool me againfood poison for two please

i am realli confus by all the 4star and 5star review for this place the 4star averag yelp rate was the reason my wife and i chose to dine here dure our stay in phoenix yelp you realli let us down this time

so i was on compani busi travel in phoenix the week of march 12th and my wife was travel with me we had a french impuls that tuesday night and tri to crash petit maison in scottsdal onli to find out that reserv were requir and there were no tabl avail the follow night still crave french cuisin we decid to stop in at sophi french bistro in phoenix

th first warn sign was that the place was entir empti dure peak dinner hour howev encourag by the strong review on yelp we decid to go ahead and order we took advantag of a coupl of happi hour special and order the following

3 chees plate
chef pate
calamari
crispi duck breast
crem brulee

th food was averag at best my wife and i both tend to critiqu food as we eat it and we both found ourselv comment that the portion were small and the food was overpr for what it was most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a veri odd flavor and consistency

th fun start about 4 hour later when we were back in our hotel room we both start experienc various intern moan and groan follow by the onset of stomach pain no big deal i thought 

bi short after midnight we were each fight for time in the bathroom take turn to vomit up everyth we had eaten that night ill tri to spare you the detail but this was the kind of violent and uncontrol vomit that i have onli experienc perhap onc befor in my entir life needless to say diarrhea was also involved

aft go through this for a good two hour my wife and i were both thorough exhaust and dehydr my wife even told me she felt like she was die and said that she had never felt this bad befor  not even dure child birth oo

so by around 230am my wife was beg for me to call an ambul for a while neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephon i eventu found a break in the vomit and manag to sip down enough water to recov slight i carri my wife out to the car and ask the hotel receptionist for direct to the nearest hospital

w drove to john c lincoln hospit on dunlap which i recommend if you ever get poison by sophi french bistro i manag to get there without hit anyth which was remark sinc i could bare see straight and could bare function at all 

onc insid my wife complet collaps and was unconsci briefli the nurs and doctor rush her into the er and brought her back around they gave her a shot of morphin and then hook her up to an iv drip of fluid as i wait i continu to experi vomit and tri to keep myself hydrat despit be in a hospit i was determin not to check myself in for treatment not want to add further medic bills

sometim around 500am my wife was readi to be discharg the offici diagnosi was acut food poison we were never abl to identifi the specif meal at sophi which poison us as we both share the same cours and ate equal amount each

howev  and this is the kicker  when the doctor ask us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was sophi they remark oh that place we learn that the er at john c lincoln has seen 3 other case of food poison caus by sophi the hospit took our inform for the purpos of compil a complaint against sophi with the az depart of health servic they told us that onc they have at least 10 confirm case then they are requir by law to report the incid as a diseas outbreak

thi all would have been nice to know befor we chose to dine at this place i can onli assum that the other poison victim either dont use the internet or are still lay in a pool of vomit somewher too weak to write a review

pleas pleas pleas dont put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night after this experi we lost all desir to dine in phoenix ever again thank sophi for ruin our trip

for the record we did have an excel meal at cibo pizza the night befor we were poison i high recommend cibo great food without food poisonaw aw custom servic  so bad in fact that we were too thorough disgust to stay for the meal we came here on a sunday afternoon which was my first and last time  ive been to other houston locat in california  and have had decent time there  in fact i love the thai steak salad

 howev this time some 20 year old idiot host walk us to our tabl and befor we even sat down and told us my mom taught me good manner so ive alway taken my hat off at the dinner tabl  

huh  first of all i was dress nice in a button up shirt and was wear my favorit footbal team hat who had just won the championship the day befor  second i hadnt even sat down at the tabl yet asswip  third while i understand this isnt applebe this also isnt ruth chris steakhous douch bag  and dont talk to me like im 7 year old

no sooner had the idiot host left befor we walk into the kitchen to get the manag  to bitch him out about his insult employe  the manag was pretti much dismiss  well guess what  im pretti much dismiss about this poor excus for a restaur

th food was definit subpar  i had the sampler which includ pollo cubano ropa vieja and masa de puerco  unfortun none of the dish was particular flavor and none were good rendit of the dish  the pollo was bland other than an over acid sauc the ropa vieja was just lack in flavor and the veget and broth hadnt been blend togeth and the masa werent crispi in the least  the whole meal was a huge let downmy first time here for lunch i went with 2 other friend 

what we had
appet artichok and spinach dip with tortilla chip 
lunch fish and chip and their special of the day meatballs

w got our appet and it was good the fish and chip were a littl on the greasi side but what do you expect for fri fish and french fri the meatbal that anoth stori they use a spice in it that had a veri strong licoric tast i think the spice is call anis there were 4 meatbal for 795 i took a small bite off of one and almost gag i could not handl the licoric tast i ask if i can substitut it for fish and chip and make it to go as we were run out of time when the check came they did not take the meatbal off and ask the waitress about it come to find out that the owner said just becaus i didnt like it i still had to pay for it i was shock  i told her then i didnt want the fish and chip i onli order a higher price item as not to walk out with onli a 30 bill  

we end up leav pay 46 800 for the meatbal that i onli had 1 bite out of it a good thing i ate my share of the artichok dip or i would have starved

i will never be come back here againblind went to taylor with a friend on sunday had i known where we were go i would have recommend someplac els i decid to be open mind and give them anoth tri i order an ice tea and the waffl he got the poach egg with hollandais and a coffe the server took our order and return with an oj for me forgiv offens  she took it away and brought me back a an ice tea 

then the incred wait began an hour later we final flag someon down to inquir on our food he said he would check for us we never saw him again there was a parti of 3 and a parti of 6 next to us they both order after us and were almost done with their meal both parti were complain about miss item i overheard a bagel a side of fruit and a waitress had all disappear at this point i was raven and we again went to find our server she final brought our food and it was horribl the waffl was dri and tasteless and the poach egg were drench in hollandais thick greasi hollandais that look and tast like it had been sit on the plate for age 

our horribl breakfast experi last 140 minut ridicul i will not be return 3 strike taylor your out i left a yelp card on the tabl hope they read this an make some improvi love yelp caus i can share my mani experi with you and the world so today in desper need of a margarita i decid to stop here with a coupl of friend for a pitcher and some guacamol after a few margarita i found their healthi menu and decid to order their  vegan veggi burrito problem was there was noth vegan about it after sever bite of the burrito i found a larg piec of burnt steak insid nasti if that wasnt enough after consum near half of the black bean it was serv with i found piec of pork in the bean that explain whi they were so salti i present all of this to the manag who was kind enough to take most of everyth minus the booz off of the bill revoltlet me share my spinato experi with you

i have had their pizza a few time but the last time was the last and i mean it the last experi was with their food i order tradit vegetarian with ad pepperoncini got home no pepperoncini oh well no big deal start eat it and discov a strang flavor kinda like dog treat went to kitchen to inspect pizza well low and behold under the inch or so of cheez i dont think it real chees was pepperoni on the tradit vegetarian uhm ok verifi the receipt and it was enter correct this household doesnt eat anim im sorri between the over sweeten sauc too much chees undercook crust and the mixup i will never again wast my money here

pleas if you want pizza do not come hereasid for the enthusiasm that the owner has for the store that place was complet crap 
i order spaghetti and meatbal with garlic bread and salad the salad was bag green and 3 cherri tomato with a littl tini packet of ranch
th spaghetti was overcook in a half inch of water the sauc had no flavor onc so ever and it came with one smaller than a cue ball meatbal almost flavorless meatbal more like a mush ball
th garlic bread was awesome

i also purchas a small jar of pesto recommend by the owner i open it just to put on my pasta becaus it had no flavor i dont even think im go to eat the pesto as it wasnt that good either 
there was what appear to be a homeless man rub through the trash look for food he was more than happi to eat my leftov that i was unhappi with 

perhap next time i should get a sub

th pesto was toss out after the weekend99 percent fulldo you love big sloppi piec of pork fat cover in barbecu sauc if so pleas come here

il be as nice as i can sinc ive onli been here onc and onli had one item   

i had open face pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw   the pork was slice thin but was 50 fat and no not just one piec of pork but the entir plate of it yuck

they must have forgot to add the dress to the coleslaw becaus it was bone dri  yummi i love raw plain cabbag how did they know

il give them the benefit of the doubt and say i just got a bad hunk of meat becaus there is no way this place could serv food like that and stay in busi  

if they chang their name to my big plate of pork fat with sauc it would better suit the meal i was served

reread my own review and now im piss that i didnt send it back i should have damn itive work in the industri for over 15 year and i have never seen such pathet servic or lack there of  i have told ton of peopl to stay away  i walk in and after 5 minut of sit by the bar by the pos system that 4 waitress were use i final got a water  then i sat there for over 15 minut and i was never approach  they walk by me over 20 time and didnt say a word to me  i cant rate the food becaus i was never serv but there was no servic  you must be a regular for them to care that you are there or you must be in a pre paid parti  i will never stip into this place again and i will continu to tell everyon i know to stay awaythe beauti carin and i had a wonder saturday even at the sunnyslop art walk we had a nice dinner at corbin and as we were drive home we talk about stop for piec of pie
i like pieit not alway about the cupcak or gelato and ice cream or even the éclair and cannoli 
sometim it would just be nice to have piec of pie and cup of coffee
i was back east recent and it struck me that you cant walk 2 block in a lot of citi in the east without go by a decent diner where you can stop in and get a piec of pretti decent mayb even homemad pie and a cup of coffeenot here
w could onli think of a coupl of candidatesvillag inn or mari callend neither chain had we been to sinc we left california in late 2003 neither was realli appeal but the lure of pie is strongtoo strong 
gps said that mari was closest and on the way home
gp did not say that this locat still smell of stale cigarett smoke from 2 year ago
gp didnt tell me that the reason nobodi was at this place at 900 in the even was becaus it just isnt even veri good pie anymor or more probabl it isnt veri good anyth anymore
gp tell me about traffic ahead and bad weather but it just doesnt do a veri good job of warn you about crappi restaurants
it was dark kind of smelli and over aircondit in mari but we press on regardless onc seat our waitress came by 
she didnt seem pleas to find out that we were onli there for pie and coffe i can understandther onli seem to be 3 tabl occupi in the entir place she was howev pleasant and for that i tip big sinc it look like we were her best prospect for decent tip on saturday
i believ that mari use to realli think their claim to fame was their piesi know they were tout whole pie in the sign as we walk in but if this is still their big deal then i am reason certain that i dont want anyth to do with anyth els they makereplicateserveunearth at mari 
the pie was no better than you would find wrap in cellophan next to the cash regist at circl k the coffe was even wors if that possible
hard to say what happen but the crust was dismal i dont think im a pie snob but the beauti carin is a baker of the first order and she make a vodka crustthat right you heard me vodka crust you replac  12 of the water in your crust recip with vodkathat to die for and i would hurt someon that tri to take one of carin pecan pie away from mei actual growl like my dog  
the fill in mari pie was even wors than the crustjust way too sugari with no flavor except sweet and no bodi at all
i like pie 
sad this wasnt itdo i realli have to give them even one star 

in the area so i drop in for a quick lunch  had the shrimp plate with fri here goes
1  the price are outrag high consid locat restaur decor and qualiti of food you cannot have lunch here for less than 11 unless you order one shrimp  ani local chines buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that
2 my shrimp look like long barrel rather than a shrimp shape this is due to the fact that they cut the shrimp in the middl and almost split it to make it look longer
3  the shrimp had too much batter  at one point the shrimp what was left of it after i took a bite came out and the barrel of fri batter was left
4  the french fri were from a bag frozen
b from the east coast i know what fresh seafood tast like this is not it folk  this place make long john silver seem like a 5 star restaur and it a lot cheaper too  
it is an outrag as a restaur  all they do is fri up everi piec of seafood that you can buy frozen at costco or sams
dont do this to yourself  when you are in the area and hungri go to the jack in the box across the street or some other fast food place youll be better off 

and i cannot believ that the peopl who gave this place 4  and 5 star are for real they have to be the relat of the owner  there is no other explanthis place is straight up creepi and run down last time i went all the gd insignia was gone and the menu serious said restaur name to be determin or someth equal as ludicr avoid at all cost the menu is subpar the servic is crappi and the decor is about two decad out of dateback in the day i use to drive all the way from surpris to eat here yes the food was that good they use to have the most killer pollo fundido as well as amaz chunki salsa 

time has certain chang this place we start with a chees crisp with green chile delici nice and crispi with just the right amount of chile strip also order their killer chunki salsa which was as good as i rememb it 

then come my pollo fundido swim im serious about this swim in a pool of greas they didnt even bother drain the thing befor toss it onto my plate was disgust too not even like clear oil but dark brown greas vile then the mister sampler show up this thing was a fuck mess you couldnt tell what was what under the pile of sauc and lettuc until you took a bite mini chimi were burnt mini taco burnt tamal cold and hard was a complet wreck 

after a few bite we call it major loss of appetit a shame too caus the salsa was actual realli good but the entre were ined 

meanwhil the mister was attach to the toilet within a few hour of eat here he was sick all day the next too so word of caution eat here at your own risk

im sure go to miss the good meal i use to have here what a real shameunfortun i have to downgrad my rate of this restaur after today events

il prefac this review with the recognit that the melt pot recommend reserv howev of the mani mani time weve visit this locat weve never had a problem get right in without a reserv owe to the fact that we go at offtim so we have a long histori of go without a reserv and have alway been seatedmayb with a 30 min wait at most but usual right away

mi wife and i walk in at 400pm on sunday our 12th wed anniversari and the park lot was near empti the hostess gave us the usual can i help you which i have alway found odd as if there is some other reason i would be there than to eat we said we didnt have a reserv and she immedi told us we couldnt be accommod appar they had sold a live social and thus the restaur was just imposs booked

thi was almost comic becaus the place was deader than disconot even a singl human voic could be heard i happen to know what live social is but what if i didnt whi is that my concern and whi is that be given as a reason for not seat me not were all book up which i can understand but appar they were save empti tabl in case peopl decid to come in and redeem their live social coupon shame on me i guess for not get a coupon

to be clear i have absolut no problem with be turn away at a restaur that recommend reserv that my fault for ignor the recommend i do have a problem with be turn away at a halfempti restaur becaus they did a live social deal and thus they cant accommod me just in case these hypothet couponhold come in the door if that how you want to run your busi fine but dont make it the custom problem

 spent thousand here and wont be go back ever again so i hope your live social was worth screw over your longterm customshame on me for go to a chain mexican restaur in arizona 

i must hang my head and sigh 

mi defens i was in the ahwatuke area i was so so hungri and my friend realli want a margarita then she end up not even order a margarita oh well

i order the chees and onion enchilada i was crave a grill chees sandwich so chees enchilada sort of fit the bill they were not veri good it tast as if they pull a corn tortilla from a packag put the chees and onion insid pour room temperatur sauc on top and put it in the microwav for a minut 

i hate pay for food at a restaur when i could have made it better at home

dont go here 

reallideliri from hunger and unabl to think straight i let my daughter talk me into the worst decis ive made in quit sometim 

we order a tempura  california roll lunch combo plus a tootsi maki and a tuna avocado roll roll in toast sesam seed 

the tempura arriv everyth was bare crisp a tad greasi but otherwis somewhat edibl 

when we got our sushi roll it was appar with one look that they were total crap howev starv as we were we decid to carri on and eat 

tootsi maki doodoo kaki 

dont be fool by the long wait they are not make these fresh to order 
this was definit a roll that was prep and prerol last night 
the seawe was chewi and slimi the dri up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixtur was like eat mayo that sat out over night 

mi tuna and avocado roll which i ask specif to be roll in toast sesam seed was no better with it also chewi seawe and raw sesam seed i didnt order a 
damn big mac wtf 

the california roll that arriv last with the salad was the same kind of prerol crap we end up leav it 

unfortun i had to pay for this shit but made sure to thank the sushi guy for the worst sushi ive ever eaten and let them know that i knew they  had serv us prerol crap and of cours they had noth to say but have a nice day 

vomitlet me start by say i wish there was an option for  a 14 star rating

3rd back to the server and servic or lack there of the server drop the check and then disappear for about 10 minut the bill was like 409 clear that not right for 2 breakfast with beverag so we hunt her down to let her know that she made an error  we were under charg she snatch the reciept and say oh you would have love to have this check huh she then turn and rush to get a new receipt no thank you noth rude she came back drop the new check and then disappear for over 15 minut this check was charg me for 3 egg i got 2 egg then she charg me for the steak breakfast plus an ala cart chicken breast 1500 later i am search for a manag the manag wasnt do much better in the servic depart she basic said i lie and had 3 egg becaus the toothless wonder in the kitchen said he rememb cook 3 egg i said did he rememb that he cook them wrong too 

bad bad bad

thi place look like fun and it close to my hous sinc they close the villag inn by me i thought this might be a good replac i was wrongwe have eaten at roy all overil az ca  hi sinc outback has bought them the food has denigr to averag to below averag to poor and the waitstaff has becom inattent at best 

ate at the roy in desert ridg at the jw marriott in phoenix sat outsid where it was a beauti even had to ask the waiter for ani special 

wife and aunt order seafood trio of butterfish mahi mahi and salmon butterfish their signatur dish was mushi and tasteless not dri and flaki mahi was dri salmon not cook thoroughly

i had the scallop three sea scallop over someth nondescript not even ani rice or veggi delici but a small portion for over 30 

usual midway dure the meal the server ask if anyon want a lava cake or upsid down cake as it take time to prepar this time noth after finish the entre server come over and ask if anyon want dessert then omit the upsid down cake from the offer i had to remind him 

eaten at roy oodl of time befor but now it a veri pricey outback aw and wont be returnive been come to this place sinc ive move to az about 10 year ago  i ate here so often that at one point i was a mayor on foursquar and duchess on yelp  theyv chang ownership twice sinc 10 year ago and the new one took over about 45 year ago i believ  their food ok but the best thing on the menu is their kimchi jjiga  that the reason whi i came here all those time and i dont even touch their banchan becaus it so subpar compar to la sf or nyc that it laughabl  their soon tofu is averag and the kalbi is averag as well  but you take what you can get here in az when you have a crave for korean food  

well if your serv mediocr food at least you expect them to provid realli good in servic right  no  i have alway been unhappi with their servic sinc day one but i just dealt with it  well ive just had it today and sort of lost it  the waiter in his 20s about 511 tall who speak fluent korean and enliglish just push me over the edg  wtf  are you kid me  i could not believ the servic i was get from this guy  ok so here what happened

i order 1 soon tofu jjiga with onli beef  2 lunch special kimchi jjiga 1 lunch special kalbi 1 lunch special kalbitang 5 total item  he brought the banchan side dish and rice and ask me if i want egg in all of our soon tofu jjiga  i said i onli order one soon tofu  then he said i order 2 kimchi soon tofu 1 beef soon tofu 1 kalbi and 1 kalbitang  i said no i didnt and i repeat what i order  then he argu with me and said yes you did you order 3 soon tofu plus kimchi jjiga kalbi and kalbitang  i said are you kid me right now  look here  were onli 4 peopl  whi would i order so mani soup for  the guy must be a moron becaus he cant even count how mani peopl there are to be order 7 item  do we look like we could eat that much  we were two slim adult and two kid under 15  then he let out a big sigh and then stomp off to fix the order at the kitchen  he come back with our food and he liter bang the soup bowl onto the tabl  he is obvious eman a negat attitud bang down the rest of the stuff and stomp off  i just shook my head and we start to eat  half way through the lunch we need more rice and napkin so i call him over sinc he was bring stuff to the next tabl  he obvious heard me and didnt bother turn around  ok so im think to myself mayb he didnt hear me  i call him again second time and he pretend he didnt hear me  then the third time i call him loud enough for the whole restaur to hear me and then he turn around roll his eye make a face and then come over  i couldnt believ my eye  i ask him are you give me an attitud right now  then he yell yes he yell at a custom at me and say did i even look at you right now  then he pass by our tabl goe to the next tabl and polit ask  may i take your order  wtf  i ask him to help me get someth and he complet ignor me  

ok so let recap here  he take the order wrong put in 2 too mani order of soon tofu then get mad at me when i correct him that isnt so then he practic throw the food at us bang everi chanc he get and then he ignor me when i call him  omg  at this point im furious  i get up and go talk to the owner who happen to be there today  i reiter everyth that just happen and he doesnt say anyth but to just look toward the direct of the kitchen  then i say to him is it ok for the server to do that to a custom and he turn and apolog  he said that it his fault for not train the staff correct  ok so ill take that for an apolog but then he should go quiet talk to the server have the server come over and apolog to me person  nope that never happen and guess what happen next  the owner come over to our tabl be extra nice and say hes go to take care of our lunch on the hous  at this point im still shake from rage and i cant even eat anymor  i said im not make a scene becaus i want free lunch  im go to pay for what need to be pay for i dont want free lunch  so while the owner talk to me at our tabl that server is stand near the kitchen talk to anoth server look direct at me and laugh at me  wow   just amaz  ive dine out at so mani restaur over the year in my life at all differ level from michelin star to holeinthewal scari place but this was just the worst servic ever

stay far away from this place  i call my mother after what happen  she was at a luncheon with 20 of her korean friend for a church function  you can bet that she spread the word  none of those ladi are go there in the futur  and neither am i  to the owner  word of mouth is a scari thingunfortun this place has realli gone downhil sinc i last ate here  review it  today visit was with mike c robyn n  jeromi h  the first negat for me was that the bathroom had onli one of those silli blower to dri your hand after wash them  you couldnt even substitut ass gasket for paper towel becaus they didnt have them either  that left me tri to turn off the faucet without touch them after wash my hand as well as open the door  at least there was some toilet paper  also of cours i got tire of stand there with my wet hand in the wind wait for them to get dri  left with them wet

out at the serv tabl there were 67 food item plus sauc  dress but there were three empti unus food tray which is not ok  they need to put someth in all the tray  also the food was allow to run out in four of the other tray that i notic  not refil dure my visit  that not ok either

i start with a bowl of won ton soup  it was not onli cold it tast as if it didnt have a speck of salt in it  in fact all of the hot food that was out was bare abov room temperatur  what up with that  also noth was identifi  more of the food was ucki for reason other than be cold  for instanc the sushi was tough  rubberi both the seawe  the rice  the orang chicken had lot of fat  late dure my meal i went for a cup of serveyourself coffe but it had been allow to run out  they just shut it off  this is all near open time a littl after 11 am

for dessert i tri the soft serv ice cream but it was the wateriest most aw stuff ive ever seen come out of one of those machines

lunch buffet is 699629 sr includ beverag but skip itum someth has happen to this place and it aint good i felt like i walk into a cronenberg film where you dont know if anyth is real

everi redeem qualiti is now gone the roam singer is gone they have a bar but dont even produc drink menus ani more and the waitstaff cant readili list drink avail not good when the wife is look for drink the servic is awkward and slow even though they sat us at a tabl next to at least a half dozen server who loiter around the kitchen area with the manag i couldnt tell if they were off the clock or hank or both 

the onli reason we went here is becaus they take reserv and someon in our parti was concern about restaur be crowd the hostess made a point of tell us over the phone that they dont usual take reserv on such short notic but they would accommod us when we arriv the place was most empti inflat sens of selfimport much

th onli reason i bother updat this is becaus you might be like me easili con into go here when your hungri well resist the temptat and insist on go elsewhercash onli pricey leav it for the tourist
som friend want to eat here becaus their senior parent love this place and would be dine with us so we met friend and senior parent here for pizza let me just say this was not my thing 

crazi setup you wait in a line and order your pizza then you go wait in a second line to order your beverag pay separ then go sit at school cafeteria tabl in a veri crowd veri loud dine room cant talk to anyon the music is deafen pack wall to wall with senior citizen which explain the taste

now ive had chicago style new york style and even california style pizza but this pizza is nurs homehospit style pizza it not good tast a littl better than a frozen red baron

organ music is good would be better if not so loud would be better if you onli wait in one line for food and drink and paid for them togeth if these two thing were differ id say worth a trip in for nostalg reason oh and it cash onli so stop by the atm and pull out plenti it also priceywhi am i the first to review this place it been on the map for as long as i can rememb and it been the same icki weird staff and just okay japanes food for just as long 

in ani case it make a compel case as as nicer than averag restaur it a larg build and has all the hallmark of a great japanes eateri sushi bar live seafood you can choos yourself and manag that hire nativ japanes to serv you all sign point to greatness

somewher between the great road sign and the arriv at actual great someon seem to have taken mr potenti and kick his teeth in befor repeat punch his groin and laugh as he rob him of his money 

let me explain

i have give this place repeat chanc to show me that it worth the real estat it plant on and repeat i have felt like mr potenti must have felt after his beat 

ive been there with group alon on date and each time it either inattent or rude wait staff and middl food that isnt anywher near the price of admission

th last and final time i went to ichi ban iron mean number 1 in japanes ha i took my girlfriend of a year as a treat for both of us whi did i go here you ask a good question and i have no accept answer other than i may have subconsi want to break it off with sandi i now have nicknam her the sand demon  say it out loud it make sens serious sand demon sandi but i digress and this was a perfect way to do it 

the food was onc again quit bad and to add insult to injuri after deliv our food our waiter began his assault 

upon find out i speak fluent japanes he switch entir over to speak japanes leav me to translat everyth into english for the sand demon as if that werent bad enough he began ask me if she was a dirti girl becaus she sure look like one to him 

i couldnt believ what he was ask me and definit wasnt go to translat it for sand demon but just in case i misunderstood him i ask him to explain what he meant he went on about how she had a nice rack and long leg and that she just look like a good time in the sack 

some peopl might view this as a compliment in some way but i usual dont have kind word for a guy who tell me my girlfriend look whorish and a good lay i told him in my most polit japanes that hed never get the chanc to find out sinc he most like couldnt get laid in a brothel and we left 

at the time it wasnt funni but it pretti funni now sure he was be rude but in retrospect she was kind of a whore but there no review area for ex by the name of sand demon so that all ill say about that for nowalway pay cash here

thi review is not about the food at filiberto i love their food and have had mani meal from differ locationsi need my filiberto fix at least onc everi coupl of week their portion are big and grossli delici 

this review is rather about a shadi credit card charg at this particular location

i drove through order my usual 16 2 fish taco with rice and bean and pull up to pay 726 as alway awesom i gave them my card they swipe i sign a receipt got one back drove off life is wonderful

2 day later im check my credit card charg and i see a charg for 926 from filiberto wtf thank i found my receipt from that purchas odd enough the receipt they gave me list that i had paid with 726 in cashit wasnt a credit card charg slip i should have look at what they gave me but who realli doe i just assum it was a credit card charg slip cram it into some orific in my car and drove off 

i dont realli feel like print out my credit card statement and argu with them over 2 especi sinc this is the closest filiberto to where i live and i dont want them spit in my food if they see that it me in the drivethru so the bastard will get away with overcharg my card this time 

but i definit did just want to warn you all about this shadi busi 

i know i will definit be pay cash for my meal here now and count my changi am not one to complain about my food but my clam pasta dish was so salti when the waitress ask me how everyth was i had to say someth she was veri nice and offer me anoth dish but i declin then the owner came over and seem piss i complain about the food and then when she ask my wife whi she did not want to take her calamari home she told her it was kinda bland but not to worri about it she got  even more piss then the owner said well i brought you a cannolli i hope it is not to salti or bland for you and walk away my wife and i where open mouth i will never return after be treat like that if you do not want to hear how the food was from the custom then dont ask i also think the owner was drink and mayb that whi she was so mean i run a busi of my own and if i ever heard of one of my employe talk to a custom like that i would fire them on the spotneitheri agre with dani this einstein bagel is slow i went here this morn just to pick up a hate to wait basket and i had to wait for the hate to wait basket first  i had to wait in a long line until the bagel man decid to take the guy order 3 peopl ahead of me befor than he was dilli dalli around throw bagel in the slicer second it seem that they were prepar a big order becaus i had to wait again until the manag was free to pick the bagel to throw in the basket doe it realli take 3 peopl out of 5 to prepar one order 

to top it off the cashier was make small talk to the polic offic in front of me he was tell him his woe of ring up the order and how sometim how he need to be creativ in type in the order pleas shut up and let the man pay for his grub dont get me wrong i like small talk but not when folk are tri to get their day startwhen i work in retail my paycheck was spent befor i got paid therefor i reli heavili on coupon and split meal w all of my other poor colleg friends

wel i hit the jackpot 15 coupon for a feast the pictur on the coupon show everyth we would get a huge steak shrimp and lobster plus 2 side there were 3 of us this was plenti 

it was prom night too so we were init fool with how popular it was popular for prom girl with light up clear shoe not even lie if that say anyth about the crowd for you

our waitress stop by our booth and just stare at us one of my friend kinda look around at me and our other friend then back at the waitress ill have a diet coke

then our waitress write it down and doesnt say anyth but look at my other friend

i lost it and start laugh whi isnt she talk to us this is so weird 

we end up ask for a differ waitress then found out the coupon was a big fat liar you didnt get all of that it just say you do but you dont the food end up be nasti probabl one of the worst meal ive ever had 

as were leav susi talk a lot waitress trip over my friend and it was all too awkward bc i couldnt control laugh 

aw food aw servic and the bathroom were some of the grossest i had ever been in 

if walmart ran a restaur this would be iti use to studi here all the time with friend and absolut love it the close proxim to home the coffe the atmospher the view of the lake and their late hour unfortun their custom servic is complet lack and i wont be back one of the baristasthat one with the nasti poni tailha major issu with peopl  like to go on littl power trip it pathet i understand that outsid drink arent allow but the way he approach peopl  confront them is beyond unaccept no i wasnt the one that he reprimand but i felt so bad for these peoplethey even bought drink befor he bitch them out ive even seen him walk outsid to tell peopl they need to buy someth or leav these peopl had just gotten there  were wait for more peopl to meet up ive never had a runin with him but ive also never had a good experi either id rather go spend my money elsewher with much better custom servic im amaz that guy still work there if he obvious hate what he doe so much to take it out on otheri came here for dimsum with a few friend dure lunch the qualiti of the food is mediocr compar the legit one in hacienta height ca or san gabriel ca my friend and i are hardcor dimsum fan so we have been to this dimsum a few time until we decid to chang to the one across the street call phoenix palac buffet 

for some reason we return back to cfu to tri it again but the servic was horribl we request water and tea and in my water cup and all around it were white residu from a previous mix drink of anoth custom i had alreadi drank half of the ice water and realiz there was all over the side of the cup i immedi ask for a replac and even the server was gross out they did not do anyth to compens for such a gross encount which in the end made everyon at the tabl lose our appetit serious traumat definit not come back until their servic improvok ok ok  now i prove it all my myself  my wife alway say that i am an idiot but i just prove it again  i am make some asian stuff for dinner tonight and i was too lazi to drive up to mekong plaza so i went to leele again  while i was there i pick up what i was look for and then thought that perhap i should make a big roast pork butt for dinner tomorrow night  but at the meat case their pork butt is cut into thick steak and there is no cut that is suitabl for roast  so i went to the meat counter and ask the guy there if they had a big piec of pork butt that i could make a roast out of  sinc he didnt speak english he couldnt help me so he call over two other guy  none of these guy spoke ani english so they just look stun and walk away  i went to ask the manag and he was too busi talk to his friend to help me  he said that i should come back later and mayb he would help me  wtf  again crappi custom servic  

but i alway believ that thing work out in the end  one of these day these guy will wake up and find that poor custom servic will eventu kill their busi  but for now i will definit shop at mekong plaza instead of herewhat i thought was decent upon the first visit had somehow morph into mediocr and in some case disgust what the heck happened

i agre with the other review about the ratio of rice to fish it ridicul how much rice they cram into their nigiri 

we did do the all you can eat sushi deal and i was total taken aback by the waitresss admonit that we will get charg for what we dont eat excus me we didnt order extravag and i doubt what we got would have total the 20 charg for the ayc 

anyway the sushi itself was about as flavor as a ten dollar bill i love eel and they manag to screw up the eel so bad that it tast like cardboard and had the textur of dri sever overcook fish the yellowtail sashimi just didnt tast right and i paid for that one for the rest of the night ouch 

ah well at least the sake is cheap and goodread al lthe hype so decid to give cyclo a tri  what a disappoint  portion were small and overpr owner think shes the next best thing to slice bread  she need to go back to vietnam to rememb how real vietnames food is prepared

g this place a missmy famili went here for dinner and i am 100 sure the staff especi justin was prejud against us becaus we were vietnames  the pho was mediocr and all the food we order were overpr  while justin made her round to chat flirt and engag all her caucasian guest we were ignor and forgotten  and by forgotten i mean they didnt bring out our food until we remind them we exist  yes the green and food were fresh howev call this place a vietnames restaur would be compar to call taco bell a mexican restaurant

w didnt care so much about the price as long as the food was good howev sinc both the food was subpar and the servic was terribl this is one place we will not be return to
      
                  
we look at our entertain book for pizza coupon and came across domino in some cruel twist of fate  sinc we hadnt had domino in easili 10 year and it was a pretti good coupon we decid in what later seem a momentari laps in judgement that we would use the coupon and give them a shot

hav research zinc bistro  i was excit to eat there unfortun when we got there in the even we found the interior to be veri dark dark enough that it was hard to read the menu i have veri good eyesight my wife polit ask if they could turn up the light and the waiter respond with a ters no and then proceed to offer to get us a flashlight i talk to the manag about the waiter attitud and the issu of the light and he was dismiss and deflect the issu say that they had alot of flashlight around we also notic that other patron where use their iphon to illumin the menu so it wasnt just us all i have to ask is whi in the world if you know it is an issu to the point of have sever flashlight readi would you subject your patron to the inconveni we left and will never return there are so mani option for great dine eg roka akor in scottsdal dont wast your time on a restaur that doesnt deliv even basic custom servic the choic is youri was up there last week with a group of friend and volunt to be the design driver for the night it was a 5 cover to hear the hous band which was no biggi and then i ask for a diet coke which was anoth 3 again no problem pay for the diet coke after about 30 minut and some danc i went up to the bar for a refil of the diet coke expect the refil to be free the bartend told me it would be anoth 3 i mention that i was the respons one for a tabl full of peopl drink and that i thought the point was not to encourag drunk drive and to encourag peopl be respons well that got me nowher so i ask for a glass of water instead i was told that the bartend couldnt give me water becaus it was a two drink minimum to get water

now it juli in az and i had been danc we had a tabl full of peopl drink and order their drink from this same bartend who cant give me a glass of water realli i dont mind pay the cover and the cost of the first diet coke im not be cheap but the point is that most bar appreci and take care of the design driver i was be respons and they couldnt even give me a glass of water

ri like morton i have been to quit a few morton in my lifetim but last night this particular locat left me with a bad tast in my mouth 

see i was there a wine event and in my defens i knew i should have made sure that i had enough cash on me prior to arriv but i didnt think anyth of it after final find a park spot and walk in then did i realiz crap i dont have enough cash the young ladi that was take money for the even was nice and she state that i could fill out a credit author form which is me basic write down my credit card inform on a piec of paper for them to charg later yea no i wasnt comfort with that idea so she said to tri to the bar as they should be abl to help you

so i go over to the bar and it was busi but not over busi i made eye contact with both bartend smile and wait 5 min later i am still wait and never receiv a  i will be right with you or hi their what can i get you howev other patron that came up to the bar after me were help immedi yea fail

even then i was like ok i let it go yes i was disappoint but i let it go so go to tri to find a manag to see if i could find a way to pay for the wine event that was go on i explain the situat to the hostess at the door and she call over a manag or the head hostess guy i am not sure she explain to him what my request was he told that hostess i cant assist her right now mean me she then said but cant we just scan her card for the 15 it will onli take a minut and the he again proceed to say i dont have time to do that so no i cannot assist her mind you i am stand right next to both of them as this convers is happen if you could have seen the look on my face the hostess immedi apolog and i tell her it is fine no worri and i turn to walk out the door when the manag or head hostess say to me  can i do anyth els for you what the are you kid me  hmm no  but thank you have been most helpful

so needless to say that i did not attend the wine event and i left morton veri disappoint from the servic i receiv at the bar down to the head hostess or manag  yes i know i should have made sure i had cash on me for this event but seriously

funni thing is that i went to anoth place to calm down and to have a drink although i was upset i still smile and made eye contact with the bartend and she immedi came over to me and said hi  give me a second and i will be right with you get this this bar was busier than mortonthe buzz of the microwav the rude servic the pretenti cash onli polici at a restaur with 1500 entre lot of syscofood product can in eye view the food here reali suck but if your lucki enough to get a kitchen view all you will hear is the hum and ding of the microwav the managerserv wen i ask him what he reccomend he got quit coindescend with menev ask that question they wil just push what is get old  what a complet douschbag i dine here 3 month ago saw this review and had to speak my peaci am origin from philli so i appreci good pizza and sub hoagi  i have been go to uncl sam for a few year now  i have usual enjoy the food and the servic was never anyth to write home about but it was never outright bad  late the servic and food have been subpar  i am not sure whi  it unfortun becaus we use to realli like uncl sam  

i recent found my self call the owner bret about an especi bad experi  even though the entir meal and servic was not accept all i ask bret for was 1500 back for the togo larg pizza the server jam in a small pizza box   the slice hot from the oven were stack on top of each other see pic  are you kid me 

needless to say i toss the pizza out and order anoth pizza from papa john for my kid that were wait at home for dinner  

i figur ask for the 1500 was reason  guess not  

bret declin to credit me the 1500 say it was his polici not to give refund  rather he offer me anoth pizza  no thank  guess he doesnt get it  it not the money  it the principthe food merit 2 star and the servic was an absolut zero

sid note 20 year ago this was perhap the busiest restaur in the valley and had brinker then famous level of train and service

th place look about the same with faux tuscan dinner hous look and italian lesson in the restroom everyth els has gone in the crapper

w were there with a parti of 10 to celebr an anniversari at lunchtim the place was virtual desert at 1230p on a sunday and yet we were seat at the wrong tabl and reseat in the veri back room

our server came huf and puf to greet us mutter and fluster that we were here not sure whi custom are seen as an inconveni in such a slow place he reluct brought water glass and later brought some of the complimentari bread mutter about our be earli not true instead of draw of sappi say with crayon on the white craft paper that cover the tabl we were afraid to ask for ice from our water we didnt want him to crack or go postal

h brought out the hous wine which is chianti from california it is onli one step up from pompeii brand red wine vinegar

much later he took our order each person was greet with a ters next dont ask for chang or ask question please

aft anoth great span of time in which we were left unattend which in this case was better the food came out my pasta milano was onli warm enough that i could eat it i would have sent it back at a reason place the garlic cream sauc was light on the garlic but complet overpow by rosemari which was not mention on the menu a brave guest did send back their lukewarm pizza which brought forth the scorn of the server

th waiter did warm up when he heard one of the guest speak of real estat but not address to the waiter he began interject his opinion on mortgag and the real estat market wow no interest in serv peopl but a verit talk head when it come to residenti real estate

anyhow we were abl to escap eventu shake our head in disbeliefi just receiv an email from the owner say they just read my review and they are sorri and hope that ill give jp pancak anoth chanc sinc they have new waitstaff  i thought that was nice of them and i serious thought about go back  then i want to read my review again sinc it been over 6 month  that when i notic that the same owner that wrote to me also is someon who wrote a stun review give jp pancak 5 star  ab   also known as amber and chad dahl who own jp pancake

now im sure it is not against the rule to write a review for yourself but i kind of think that like vote for yourself for homecom queen  i just dont think that right  it throw off the rate of everyon els who is judg your restaur  i think it kind of scummi that they did that

now i definit will not return to this dirti dingi place   i am complet and utter confus about these review for year i have heard about how great the food is and how peopl alway by the salsa and chip 

i order a burrito of some type and cut it open and then water yepwat pour out of this burrito i was like wtf

i regret tri a bite and it was dri flavorless and the littl flavor it did have tast like fish 

the water must have been from it be premad and frozen or almost rotten and frozen to save it a few extra days

th chip were stale and thick gross had a strang flavor the salsa was so gross it was uned 

what is wrong with you peopl did you drop acid befor you ate hereim definit not the type of person who like to give mere 1 star but after my experi here it hard to give it anyth more  the onli thing go for it realli was the view too bad though that it was too dark to see the water

w went here for my birthday dinner a few night ago  walk in nice decor but were greet by the smirk of a man who was look down his nose at us  especi sinc we didnt have a reserv  the place wasnt busi mayb half full if that  we wait patient for about 20 minut to be seated

th waitress was somewhat polit i mean she did tri to cater her suggest to her audienc  im japanes but you know just becaus i am doesnt mean that you need to suggest all the asian dish as specialti  she did the same racial profil to the tabl next to us of italian  while i understand her mean behind it and im sure she didnt mean to be offens i just found it odd  unfortun she also didnt know anyth at all about the wine but i made a select we enjoy anyhow 

we order the calamari as the app and it came out cold  i person have never enjoy cold fri item but hey that me  im not all that sure how long it had been sit in the window but sinc it took about 30 minut to arriv at the tabl i assum a while  the whole night it felt as though our waitress was avoid us sinc the calamari sat near untouch for at least 15 minut until she came by with my friend clam chowder soup  the soup he said was good but i found it slight inexcus that she kept walk past our tabl and look at the untouch appet whilst she continu to servic the tabl next to us to her fullest extent for our entre he order shrimp 3 way and i order a simpl shrimp and crab pasta  his was overcook to the point of rubber and mine made me feel ill immedi after consumpt  we both decid to skip out on dessert due to the aw servic and poor food qualiti  

one thing that upset me is when a restaur ruin it ingredi and this one did  go for the soup and noth els  if you expect even a smidgen of decent servic dont even bother it over price and pretenti for food that is improp prepar  befor exit the establish i had to excus myself in order to go bulim and my friend felt incred sick the next day  stomach bewarate there last night

so it was with happi heart and high spirit that we head down the street to the post tourney repast at skip  janslet me start by say that the lifetim group pick this place and it almost like they knew they were go to lose and want to select a venu that would be the grimiest greasiest grubbiest grossest spot to tri to eatthey succeeded

wher to starti knowth park lot

when we arriv the total kelli blue book valu of the 5060 car in the park lot was about 832we rais that by sever order of magnitud just by drive inthi park lot hasnt seen a lot of traffic from the mercedesbmwlexusjaguar crowd and may never again

aft i safe park a block or 2 away i went insid and took in the look and feel of sjcrappi old wood panelingt and chair from a circa 1955 high school cafeteriaan intrigu mix of flat panel tvs regular tvs and otb result screen yeah you can bet the poni hereth sport of king in a slight less than regal atmosphere

they must have 2025 pool tablesfad feltand a whole bunch of peopl play pool and frank look like they werent enjoy themselvesextrem tight and serious express on the face of the peopl play and watchingar game suppos to be fun i suspect there was gambl go on

th smell in sj can onli be describ as extrem humanityth place smell like it has seen a centuri worth of spill beer cigarett smoke bo vomit urin spoil food and everi other aroma that human creat for themselvesremark given the fact that this place cant have been here for more than a few yearshow did they do that so quick 

sj has menus they have some sort of kitchen they have jagermeist on tap they have a bunch of beer on tap and they had a buffet or boofay for my friend ryan c set up for our group

it was suppos to be a taco bar

sj provid a tabl full of taco fixinsth centerpiec of which was the taco meat hot trayholi crap was that disgust 

they told us it was ground beef but i know my beef and i dont think this was itthi was ground creatureposs some sort of unfortun nondistinct anim which happen to be near the kitchen when duti called

i kid of coursea far as i know this was inde beefjust not veri good beef

th hot tray hold the meat look like a relief map of the hawaiian islandssmal mountain of meat rise out of the ocean of brownorang greas that was the real bodi of the dish

but i was starv a banana for breakfast and noth els so i tri to make a taco

i decid to forgo the slot spoon that everyon was tri to use to fish some meat out of the soupi brine and use some tong insteadmi idea was to tri to squeez as much greas out of the concoct as possiblei was sort of success but in do so i probabl squeez ani flavor out as well

i got back to the tabl and tri a bitenot goodi ad sever shake of cholla and tri anoth biteand that was that

on of my buddi had decid to forgo the mysteri meat taco and order wing from the menu and offer me oneim not sure what the deal with the wing was but the wing i tri seem to be boil no not broiledboil and then dip in buffalo saucenot crispi just wetal the way through

i did like the sauc 

i may give them anoth chanc and then edit this review after that but it may be awhil until i work up the courag to eat there again

a day after eat here i nicknam this place thee pot becaus that where you will spend part of your day after eat herevisit 6212

so my quest for good bbq in arizona continues

w actual took the time to drive across down just to visit this locat  my friend recommend it base on prior experi from year ago  and also becaus it made diner drivein and dive  our hope was to find a better experi than our weekend prior 

we were veri disappoint  i had the meat combo  it is a sampler of all the meat  brisket pull pork chicken pull rib  both beef and pork ham and chop a mix of chop pork and ham  the meat had no appet appear  the tast was not much better  the meat was dri on top and dri through out   rib over cook as the meat on pork rib were fall off the bone the avail sauc on the tabl was basic and when i ask for a hotter version of the bbq sauc i was brought anoth bottl that came cold like out of the refriger and it was not veri spici  even for my friend 

the side were disappoint  the bake bean tast much like they came out of a can  the cole slaw was bad  like it went bad  tast sour and bitter  so bad that i sent it back

th onli good thing were the onion ring  these were veri crispi and fresh  

we went in about an hour befor close  there were veri few peopl there  but servic was slow  took about 15 minut just for the onion ring  and anoth 15 minut for the main dish  consid this is a bbq meat that is suppos slow cook for hour it seem like it would not take veri long to prepar  unless you have to go back and reheat  just think out loud here

ov all this was a failur  a wast hour drive for bbq that would have been better at some local chain locat 

mayb it was becaus we arriv close to the close hour  but then again if you seat me then serv me a good dish  otherwis dont serv me

fin would i return  mayb for lunch and a quick sandwich  will i ever drive that far again  no  are there other choic in this area yesthis place is gross their sauc tast like ketchup the food is alright but this is not award win bbq they must have stolen someon els award and put their name on them we went here caus it was on ddd and boy were we disappoint not to mention our waitress was rude and took forev to bring anyth to our tabl in the middl of the day the place was empti if you want good bbq dont come here becaus you wont get itif i didnt have a big pizza in front of my face i would have thought i order a big serv of attitud with a side of screw you

mayb it becaus we came in with a couponbut this place had more ego than a 15 minut celebr  

not to knock small famili own place usual i love go to place like that becaus usual you get a friend famili feel but for a pizza joint locat in a shop center next to albertson they sure want to make you think you were eat caviar

th not so awesome
1  whomev answer the phone didnt know east from west to be abl to give directions
2  our waitress couldnt give ani suggest on the food
3  they cant do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra
4  you pay a charg if you want to split a plate of food
5  attitud attitud attitude
6  tip was alreadi includ in our bill

iv never been to a famili run pizzeria that cant do a half and half pizza and the onli restaur ive ever been to that charg to split a plate of food are one where youd feel more comfort wear  a dress  definit not one in a strip mall like this one

i swear if the two waitress roll their eye or huf ani more than they alreadi did they probabl would have faint from lack of oxygen and vertigo

and last time i look i believ i was old enough to do my own math for your tip  if you were so scare we were go to stiff you on your tip mayb you should learn a littl someth call cusstoem surviss

foodwis the pizza was not the best ive ever had in fact it was a bit on the dri side   i cant say it was absolut horribl but neither can i say i was in heaven  the wing were much better in my opinion

for the pain of the drive and have to dodg eye dagger this is a definit nopeatrude owner
w have been go to grimaldi now grazziano for 10 year  we are a famili of 5 and my stepson who is 26 and husband are big eater they can easili eat enough food for a famili of 6 all by themselv today we walk out and vow never to return becaus of the owner rude behavior we love the wing and the happi hour special and alway support a famili busi over the big boy anyhoooo
if you order hot wing it must be in increment of at least 6 and you get a dress if you order in increment of 12 you still onli get one dress so my stepson has 2 order of 6 just so he can get his 2 dress well when they refus to give him 2 without charg him the extra 59 cent i mean the money wont break us but the princip of it all is crazi so he call the owner over and ask her as soon as she got to our tabl she was rude and told him in a tone so basic your want to get out of pay the extra 59 cent no i have never seen a restaur owner speak to someon like this then we call her back when the food arriv and she strut over to our tabl and first thing out of her mouth was now what realli that left a bad tast in our mouth and he told her forget it give me the check for the drink and salad we are leav she argu and say over 59 cent he say no over your attitud i did not need to be talk to like that she say you dont understand how expens ranch dress is in her condescend tone i was floor she lost our week busi for sure now as a restaur owner she should have written off the ranch dress as we have been loyal custom for year the other peopl who work there are nice and i feel bad for them if she treat her custom like this imagin how she treat them i hope she see this review and respond with her feedback she has no one to blame  for lost busi but herselfi search yelp to tri find decent sushi while visit phoenix with my famili my wife and i went here after look at review and we were extrem disappoint our server was veri polit and attent but the qualiti of the sushi was veri poor my wife like roll and i prefer nigiri we were worri when we got there and he menu show almost everi roll contain crab mix this is code for a blend of artifici crab meat and some kind of mayo or similar sauc  aka cheap filler we cross our finger and order anyway 
first we had appet spring roll and miso soup the spring roll were deep fri flavorless mush we ate one if the four the miso soup was so salti we couldnt finish 
the roll came next and like the spring roll they were mushi and flavorless so sad the nigiri was yellowtail and had a strong fishi tast which if youv ever had hamachi you know it suppos to be a mild flavor with no fishi tast 
this is the first time ive ever sent an entir meal back and ask not to pay we paid for our drink and left the waitress a nice tip wasnt her fault and left 
the owner  manag was nice but said he tri our food and thought it was accept   huh 
worst part was that we wast a rare  kid free date night on this place ive had sushi from venu rang from groceri store to fanci place in tokyo and this was hand down the worst attempt at sushi ive tastnever in my life did i think id be eat breakfast at rsc at 730 on a monday morn and how i got there involv spin a wild yarn about drive to chinl arizona on the navajo indian reseverv via winslow joesph citi and holbrook that start at 130pm on sunday afternoon if youv never driven through the res at night dont it terrifi honest scare me to death and i dont scare easily

aft wake up at 530am in flagstaff common sens say stop in flag for a bite to eat befor head down the hill common sens fail us at 8pm the night befor 

we got to rock spring and i was expect it to be busi hard 1 group of 4 eat breakfast after perus the menu i was in that state between hungri and readi to vomit and drool all over myself the server was nice enough and the coffe was good enough to stave off the vomit and drool 

i was hope for pancak but sinc there was no real mapl syrup no dice hfcs syrup is the worst no aunt ive ever met would condon that i settl on the western omlet it came with countri potato and toast the countri potato were the freezer store bag type precut omg there that vomit feel again serious no honest to good home cookin countri diner serv me frozen anyth that blasphemi honest no hash brown either they were out how do you run out of hash brown get a potato get a grater and get to work coffe cake no dice becaus they didnt feel like make it today i cant make this stuff up 

the egg were so weak averag that i left about a quarter of it uneaten it was just flat and bland 

and we paid 35 for the privileg no thank rock spring   

about the fruit pie theyr can the fill is the can stuff that you can buy at the store crust are flour water graham cracker ive seen them make the pie and my teeth hit the floor when i saw them pour can fill into a crust it was the generic shamrocksyscosouthwest food can fill i cant speak on the pecan pie but the fruit pie are can lemon merangu can rave about them all you want but know it possibl to make the same thing at home for a fraction of the cost we had been buy pie here for the last 15 year on our way up to the cabin the day i saw them pour that fill into their fruit pie that was it 15 year of loyal patronag all gone  

im all done with rock spring pie and allif your in search of food keep drive  
if your in search of pie drive to the pie hole in phoenix  

i use to go to rock spring cafe on a month basi with my grandpar when i was younger  that was our thing  take a sunday drive and stop by rsc on our way back home to grab food and a piec of  penni pie   penni was the gal that use to make all the pie in black canyon citi  i learn while we were wait for our tabl that there are new owner and oh my how thing have chang  from the appear and layout to more import  the qualiti of the food   

keep on drivin if your hungri and in this neck of the wood  j babi c and i stop by rock spring to get an earli supper on sunday after a day trip up north  i told him about how good the pie were and the food was in general  he was on board when it came time to figur out what we were do for supper   

j order the meatloaf dinner and i order the chicken  our plan was to feed babi c off of both our plate  good idea in theori  when we order i state i want a bake potato which was on the menu and the gal said that they dont serv bake potato until after 5pm  ummmit sunday and a holiday weekend  if one was go to sell a bake potato 4pm on a sunday would be the right time  no where on the menu did it state that bake potato werent avail until after 5pm  

j get the soup chowder and i get a side salad  you realli cant screw up either of those  j said his soup was pretti good  

our dinner come out a few minut later  we were shock to say the least  we both dig in and j immedi is repuls  his meatloaf was lukewarm greasi and the gravi on top was congeal  gag  my chicken was more like a cornish game hen  see photo for the world smallest chicken leg  it look more like a drumett you know the kind youd get with an order of chicken wing  the veget that came with out dinner a half ear of waterlog field corn  an ear of corn a bad ear at that hard constitut as veget  i was think wed get green bean pea carrot or someth  

the waitress came by and saw j was not pleas  so she took his plate and ask if he want anyth els i told him to skip the regular food and to just get a piec of pie  if he was hungri we could get him someth at the outlet in anthem which was where we were stop by on our way home  j like this idea and order a slice of banana cream pie  

when the pie came out he took a few bite and that was it  he said it tast like imit banana and was not cold but slight warm  i serious doubt this was a true penni pie  more like a bad knockoff    

the onli posit thing out of the whole trip was the waitress took his dinner and pie off our bill without us have to ask or talk to a manag  

we stop by the general store but the guy there didnt seem interest in help us  or at least help me  but yet he yack it up with j for a minut  when i walk over to the counter to tri a sampl he was push j did he acknowledg me  nope  so we left

and we wont be return  if were out for a drive and are in need of foodwel drive to anthem  

and  if you realli want a good more like awesom piec of homemad pie go to the pie hole in phoenix  my wife our friend kathi rand i came here for karaok and dinner again when we arriv there was onli a few peopl in the saloon have dinner

when our meal final arriv they were either lukewarm or cold kathi told us to tri a bite of her fish there look to be two small piec of fish that wouldnt satisfi a child so we declin we did tri the home made potato chip they were a littl abov lukewarm kathi said the fish was bland and if it didnt come with tarter sauc it would have had no tast at all  she said her dinner salad was better than the last time she was there but her appl pie tast like it came from a can certain not like home made or someth that would be famous

carol dinner honey fri chicken and waffl and a slice of coconut cream pie  the chicken was cold so were the waffl bake potato and the corn she offer me a piec of chicken to tri and sure enough it was cold it tast awesom and im sure would have been enjoy if it was hot like it should have been she onli ate one piec and the waffl befor becom so disgust she had enough she ate her salad a bite from the corn and her pie she said her pie was veri good 

mi entré grill liver and onion when my dinner arriv the bake potato was so cold it wouldnt even melt the butter so i didnt eat it the corn on the cob was the same way and i left that as well i did eat most of the liver but didnt finish it becaus it wasnt hot  there was also a small dinner salad that came with my meal which i ate

w were all go to send our dinner back but our waiter disappear for so long and we were hungri we dug in like i said we were all hungry

kathi r ate her salad her fish dinner was two piec of small fish and lot of home made chip she ate the fish after smother it in tarter sauc her salad and some of the chips

im surpris when our waiter final came back to our tabl he didnt ask how our meal were or comment about all the food that wasnt eaten nope he didnt even bother mayb he figur it was better not to ask i dont know

food portion are ok although our friend kathi fish look like it came off the kid menu it was so small servic slow slow slow but it wasnt our waiter fault it is manag our waiter was actual hustl and do his best conclus  we all decid everyth consid when we return here for  karaok we would stop somewher els for dinner none of us want to give this place anoth tri especi in light of their price i dont mind spend my hard earn money at a restaur if the food is good this place doe not deserv our continu support if i could have rate this experi on a scale from one to ten one be bad id rate it a  minus 20 return factor for food 0

in town for spring train my husband and inlaw decid to tri this restaur due to the glow yelp review unfortun from the minut we walk in the experi was disappoint we arriv for dinner around 830pm a late dinner i admit and no one was at the hostess station there are mani diner and the waitstaff is whizz around but no one is pay attent to the door we stand around for around 5 minut until final someon notic us we are seat order and dont receiv our food until close to 930pm we ask the waitress what go on she say they have a parti of 12 on the other side of the restaur that caus the slow down the tabl behind us is also upset by the long wait and ask for some free wine ballsi but i guess they have a point though i dont believ the restaur ever offer them anyth when we do get our food my mother inlaw chicken is raw serious i was shock and even tast a piec to be sure yuck raw chicken we sent it back to the kitchen howev my mother inlaw was turn off to chicken all togeth after that she end up ask for just a simpl pasta and sauc as we ate our food no waitstaff to be seen no water glass refil no one come over to see how were do our side of the restaur has been abandon to the 12 person parti on the other side did i mention this place is incred noisi too the acoust are horribl it a struggl for us to get our bill sinc no one is around my husband mention to anoth staff member someon higher up than our waitress unsur how disappoint we are in the qualiti of food and the servic but that person just doesnt seem to care youd think mayb the restaur would comp the simpl pasta my mother inlaw end up get to make up for the fact that they tri to serv us undercook food but they did not we were still charg and that place isnt cheap

mi food was pretti good  crab and shrimp with red sauc on pasta and i believ my husband and father inlaw food was also good howev our whole experi was taint by the poor servic i am veri awar we probabl caught this restaur on a bad night  but we wont be go back or recommend it to anyon this place is not cheap and it not worth go hereim not usual one to review the chain but this outback is so far off the norm i feel oblig to warn other run hide you have tastier options

whil the server here are pleasant and quick the kitchen is not so effici and the manag seem to back up their cook instead of listen to custom here are my three experiences

visit one order the mahi mahi which appear thick and succul on menu photo receiv thin dri piec that smell of ammonia and rot sent it back manag told me she was sorri i didnt like the fish it not that i didnt like it it was bad 

visit two hubbi order the coconut shrimp his longtim fave at outback throughout the countri lo these live up to the name shrimp they were half the size they were elsewher entre was fine order a salad bake potato and steam broccoli becaus i am a wild hog had to ask for broccoli sever time befor it came out cold ate it anyway 

visit three coconut shrimp again and these look bigger yay boo same tini shrimp bigger bread boo hiss

ord a rare ny strip with salad bake potato and broccoli receiv a medium steak with salad and potato no broccoli waiter came to check and knew befor i told him that steak was overcook offer to let me keep potato but then he wouldv had to carri steak in his hand or teeth remind him about broccoli 

manag return with new steak rare but so tough and fill with gristl i was stun broccoli hot yum tater hot yum until i discov a huge rot spot insid when he came back to check on the replac dinner i show him how hard the steak was to cut but said i would eat it anywaymi husband was alreadi done with his dinner show him the potato and he said it was just a piec of skin 

um no this girl know rotten when she see it he gave in and brought me a new potato but seem clear mif that i was so picki 

i am not a whiner realli but when thing are rotten or are not proper cook i do send them back at this outback the manag seem irk with custom who exercis that right sad realli becaus it is just as easi to exercis my right to eat elsewherrolf  i hate to give ani busi a 1 star rate especi when it a local own but after two differ visit to hot bagel  deli in surpris i view them as a potenti health hazard  

our last visit start off on the wrong foot with the owner have a convers between themselv and ignor their custom  we order two bagel sandwich for lunch  asiago chees bagel with ham  chees and a side of chip and drink  they onli offer two choic of chees swiss and american which i dont like either my friend order a turkey  swiss onli choic on a jalapeno bagel  

half way through our bagel sandwich i notic littl blue dot on bottom of his bagel and they were not jalapeno rolf  the bagel were old chewi and came with a bit if penicillin apparently

thi was my second bad visit and dont plan to go back  i tri to tell the owner about our experi and she turn away and walk off wowserdo not go to this bakeri  the staff is veri unprofession and rude  my father who is legal blind with diabet went in and ask if he could possibl put in a special order for canoli made with splenda and then the staff start cuss and yell at him and told him to go somewher els  we will now go to roman in phoenix  my daddi bakeri need to be shut downit almost as if cucina tagliani doesnt even exist despit it visibl locat right off the loop 101 freeway ive never seen a wait to some that might be a good thing in my opinion if it too easi it probabl not worth it and cucina tagliani prove that it isnt worth it time and time again 

let start with first impress tacki and unorigin the whole interior is decor to look like some small italian villag or someth oh gee ive never seen that look beforeoh wait isnt that what everi italian place look like 

the food is soso noth special at best and downright disgust at worst they dont even have spaghetti and meatbal this place fill the italian restaur stereotyp to a tee and then they dont offer tradit italian fare it just doesnt make sens 

the servic is just terribl they never have enough peopl to keep everyth run smooth and the waitress are so fake work in the food industri myself im not the kind of custom that ask for three side of ranch after my food is alreadi at the tabl but even if you order the simplest item the waitress will still treat you like theyd want noth more than to poke your eye out with the roll utensil 

with this dead combin it no wonder oliv garden has a 45 minut wait at ani given time and tagliani cant even fill the dine roombuca di beppo is liter italian restaur hell you know how all big box chain restaur throw junk up on the wall in an attempt to make the space feel vintag buca di beppo throw junk and knick knack and statu and anyth els italian they could find in the chines warehous where they load up these good it a terribl horribl mess and you end up sit in a yardsal of italian paraphenalia while eat your veri bland pasta


it embarass how truli flavorless the food is here thin flavorless alfredo sauc thick slab of lasagna with less tast than what i can get out of the frozen section at publix i went with a larg group and across the tabl bland food

when they seat your parti they guid you through the kitchen area where the cook play along and say a welcom hello deep down you know they hate this whi are we in the kitchen sure it nice but id rather have them concentr on make the food and make it good of cours the food at buca di beppo seem to be far beyond ani point of return to tast good it just dead dead food no life no flavor not emot i get more flavor from the 99 michelina frozen lunch package

far from claim anyth authent italian buca di beppo even pump out bread with no tast eat at buca is like eat food from an assist live facil no salt no sugar no butter no fat it all gone along with anyth resembl tast sure buca has huge portion and the setup is nice for larg parti and famili  but they might as well just buy the familys pasta pack from the frozen section and bake it at home even that would be better and they wouldnt have to the mandatori gratuiti say what you will about other italian chain like macaroni grill or oliv garden  at least their food tast like somethlook let face it maggi moo you never even stood a chance

your flavor are pedant and unimagin your servic is lacklust and dishearten and your price defi logic

it fuck ice cream and not even good ice cream i wouldnt know mayb if you took better care maintain your merchandis it wouldnt tast so terrible

wheth the flavor too soft or too hard it requir you take the reserv tray out of the freezer and serv some of that to me instead 

so appar your display case is just that display

your mixin are lame and stale mms and sprinkl gee dont give yourself a fuck aneurysm with all this creativ 

so you realli didnt have much go for you alreadi by the time your cashier call me sir twice 

the second time was my fault though i tri to interven and correct her

i that all for you sir
umit maam actual im a girl
oh im sorri sir

if i hadnt said anyth i wouldv onli been offend the one time mea culpa

it not entir that girl fault im give you one star but it certain help convince

youd be well inform to know im write a letter not to your manag or anyth 

but to coldston creameri beg them back

i figur whi be with a knockoff of a piec of garbag when i can just be with the real deal you know

ha ha who am i kid 

this one event will probabl deter me from ice cream all togeth 

ill need to set gelato  frozen custard on the ice cream orient box on all my social profilill start from the begin when this place is busi for some unknown reason the park is a nightmar due to the lack of space and the inexperienc driver the absolut worst thing was me wit the valet girl stall someon car i realli couldnt help but laugh  whi would you be valet car if you didnt know how to drive stick

when you walk in everyth is kind of new and trendi look i notic a lot of younger peopl like to go here so if that not your crowd then this isnt where you want to be after 7pm i person dont like trendyyoungandcool sushi spot ive onli gone for dinner time so i cant speak for what it like at lunch 

the few time ive been here the sushi wasnt all that great  and i feel im a pretti good judg when it come to the sushi depart i tri to give new place a chanc so ive been here mayb 3 time sushi still wasnt all that our servic alway left someth to be desir and the last straw

i could not believ after mediocr borderlin poor servic our waitress had the nerv to hand me our bill and circl the suggest tip she wrote down serious i alway tip my server well and accord and a whole lot more when the servic is excel i round out my bill to the next dollar and will never come back here againit been a while sinc i have eaten here but when i last went i had a horrif experi  i got the chicken salad which was full of dark meat bone gristl skin etc  i had to run to the bathroom and get rid of it  when i return to the tabl i calm explain to the manag i was unhappi with the food you could see that the qualiti of food was realli low  the manag was rude and i had to argu with him to remov the meal and my drink from the bill  i would think that after a custom was caus to vomit he would have alreadi taken my meal off the billat the least  id never go back  i wrote a letter to the head chef of the chain and copi the manag and got absolut no respons from either  poor food  poor servic  poor manag that goe all the way up to the highest levelhave to complet disagre with the first review  as a southern this place is an insult  a total sham  1 it filthi  2 it filthi and 3 it total overpricedoh did i mention how dirti the joint is

took some southern cowork all the way from unlv for lunch  wont do that ever again  the wait was 20 minut for the gal to step out from behind a counter to bring us a menu we were the onli one there    hello  

the menus were sticki  the place smell bad  they had clean chemic out on the same counter where they serv food  final put them away about midway through lunch service

w were hope for someth authent lunchwis  like a meat and 3 plate  in the south it easi to find about 20 mom and pop that offer this for oh anywher from 3 inclus of tea and pie   to 6 for a fanci joint where tea and pie are extra

no meat  3 here all a la cart  so to replic that were talk your in for 20 easi for lunch im serious  

bad fri chicken bad mac  chees bad green bad can bean bad bad bad tea that was so sweet my teeth still hurt

sham on you kathi  real southen know betteri would love to bring my mama here when shes feel homesick  but this will just make her sick and break her heartthi place truli has no soul

to add insult to injuri when it was time to pay the check they have this ancient system that charg a set amount  plus a servic charg to run your card it such a scam 

i realli want to love this place  as it stand now it probabl top on my list of place that ill never give a 2nd shot hope this save you a triplivid  they need a zero star rate i came in and was polit when they quot me a 710min wait time i said no problem and sat patient and had my money in hand intend to leav a littl extra as a tip
i ask for hash brown with green pepper and mushroom and explain no onion due to an allergi to go with a coffe they gave me a box full of onion onli no hashbrown w green pepper  they also gave me a togo coffe cup with creamer and sugar fill with cold dark pepsi and a bill hope i would pay without check my order befor leav  they rush me to pay and when i stop to check my order they liter ran scream oh no  shes check her food disgusted

mi stomach just growl in pure agoni at the idea of slop they packag as some sick joke on my limit time to head to busi and it hour later treatment like this should not be toler and believ i wont be shi in protect other from such a unwarr spite cruel and uneth experi im keep the box in the freezer should anyon at this establish take a moment to review the poor experi mention thus far about this particular locat on green valley  ive seen zero respons to other patron to date which paint a pretti clear pictur as to just how this type of behavior continu  

this is not a person opinion a food critiqu this is a huge slap in the face to a local with a big heart for support her communiti but a bigger mouth when it come to cruelti not let this one rest

th phone has rang approxim 20x for me to call in what happen  no answer  they pick up somewher between ring 20  30 inform me the manag was gone for the day not come in tomorrow doesnt have an email and to call back anoth time after put in way too much out of charact work i receiv the contact name of chencho and hope he will be just as appal by the behavior as i wasami realli didnt think i would ever have a reason to rereview this chipotl locat nor did  i ever dream that i would have a reason to give it such a poor rate  howev my fiancé recent got terribl food poison from this place  he went to the hospit and test posit for salmonella after eat a chipotl chicken bowl  it was all he had eaten for mani hour so the result of his test were pretti conclusive

i went in to let the manag know what happen i didnt want anyon els to get sick  when i told her what my fiancé had experienc she said oh that imposs  our chicken is allnatur  it cant make you sick  oh so it magic chicken  i didnt even know what to say that so wrong so i suggest that mayb it hadnt been prep proper then  her respons  you are mistaken  all my employe do everyth right  so then what am i left to think  she basic accus me of lie  i dont know how you could given that i have conclus medic test and the linger smell of vomit on my shirt to prove my point  i was nice about it when i came in  i didnt want anyth more than to be assur that expir date would be check and safeti procedur reinforc  instead i was dismiss and made to feel like a fool

to the compani credit i contact the nation headquart becaus i felt like we were deal with a pretti serious safeti issu  my complaint definit didnt fall upon deaf ear  within the hour i receiv an email that they had launch an immedi investig of this restaur  some pretti egregi issu were found with this locat so we wont be back  regardless i have to give credit to the compani for take swift action to address our concern  

still it is sad that i had to go to such length to ensur that safeti protocol is follow  i cant believ a manag would dismiss my claim rather than just take a minut to check expir date on the food  i didnt get so much as an apolog  i dont tend to take thing lie down and this time was no except  i have it on good author that the manag is no longer with the compani and some staff retrain will be occur  i can sleep better at night know that mayb just mayb this wont happen to someon els  my fiancé was veri veri serious ill for a while becaus of this and i wont forget what he went through next time i even think about step food into a chipotlit sound like the food here is spectacular and i wish id have been abl to tri it unfortun im not cool with be point ignor when i walk in somewher and say hello to the person behind the counter 

long stori short i walk in was ignor went to counter was ignor got order taken tri to use a coupon the ladi said no i cant use it no 

oh alright

i was order the daili special and want to use an entertain coupon id have understood if she had been realli nice and just let me know that she would be lose money on a coupon then id have pocket the coupon and went about with the order i just dont like be treat like a stupid jerk i get ignor and given attitud like this when i wear a name badg i dont need it when i enter an establish to spend money so i told her id just go somewher els and she shrugged

no big loss for either of us i supposwalmart flew over the cuckoo nest everi singl employe here freak me out this weekend i am sure it doesnt help i had just left heaven otherwis known as in n out burger but still do they get their fuck employe in the twilight zone 

we walk in through the garden center and are instant greet by a smile employe hose the plant she earn the star for the store good job next we brows the plant pot etc the plant were veri poor qualiti and half dead we ventur insid and that when it get ugli our entir mission was to see their select of outdoor rug dure the summer in vega most store do carri them sinc we all spend more time outsid in the sun by pool bbqing etc this was my first visit to this specif locat so i had no clue where the desir rug section may be i look for a friend face in a green shirt to assist me as im walk in circl 3 peopl in odd color green shirt quick walk pass me with empti zombi like express on their face almost as if they are walk into the light and i dont exist ok i decid i was go to keep look without ask for help then my partner in crime got brave and approach one of the walmart zombi and ask where the rug are the zombi sayswel your on your way huh wtf kind of answer is that sinc we were serious wonder in circl we didnt know which was the right way then i inquir about outdoor rug the zombi look at me as if it was a trick question do you mean doormat indoor and outdoor rug are the same at this point i was livid and could not respond my friend said thank you and shuffl me away befor i slap a ho sinc the outdoor rug was a fail we then made a half ass attempt to find big hefti trash bag with zero success both of us gave up and ditch our cart of random water noodl pot etc 

what even more upset is befor i start write this review i googl patio rug and low and behold walmart actual doe have a huge select of outdoor rug now if onli your employe knew thiswhere do i start

wait a long time to get seated
wait a long time to get drinks
wait a long time to place an order
wait a long time to get our food refil etc
wait a long time to get out of here
w basic just wait and wait and waited

lobst and crab were cold and like rubber no hot melt butter it was noth special  worst part of it was i tip 15 and the girl still call me out in front of everyon oh was everyth ok becaus you onli tip this much blah blah blah and on our way out we she was still complain i was be nice when i tip realli should have given them no tip or a bill for wast my time  i dont know what she was think but someon clear doesnt belong in the hospit industry

definit the last time at this locati have heard noth but good thing about this restaur so when my gf saw a groupon for it we decid to tri it out 

first impress the woman who greet us at the door was the owner wife we arriv 30 minut earli she sat us but overal i wouldnt describ her as warm or welcom  mayb she was have a bad night who know but leav your negat at the back door  

it a veri nice look restaur warm color romant light but there is somewhat of a steril feeling

th server zack was great he was veri accommod to my gfs dietari restrict and was veri friend all of the other servic staff includ the owner son were also friend and servic was veri smooth 

the food the bread that come out i delici danger delici there is a pizza type of bread that has marinara and chees the textur was light as air the other bread was equal as good 

there is a yelp check in offer for a complementari bruschetta the flavor were great but the tomato mixtur was ice cold

i order the brodetto the flavor were also veri good but brodetto mean broth and the sauc was more of a marinara sauc thick not a broth by ani means

i had the ossobuco milanes it was veri delici the saffron risotto was perfect cook and a perfect compliment for the ossobuco

they have gluten free pasta which is great for peopl who eat gluten free like my signific other they serv it with a mushroom cream sauc which she enjoyed

dur our dine experi we notic the owner gaetano walk around talk to all of the regular when he did stop by our tabl it seem like it was almost forc he bare look us in the eye not exact the warm welcom we expect for patron his restaur 

in the end we ask for our check when the owner wife present the check she told us gratuiti was includ not onli that but the gratuiti was ad on the after tax total not the befor tax subtot this is just tacki not someth you should do to local tri out your restaur for the first time yes it say they add gratuiti on the groupon but groupon  also say to make sure you tip off the nondiscount total  sinc zack and the staff were so great i ad more to make it an even 20 which is what he deserv i think a parti of 2 shouldnt have their gratuiti ad this left a veri bitter feel toward this restaur just write about their auto gratuiti polici is get me mad 

it seem this restaur has all the right make of someth great it nice look has good food friend staff  but the owner attitud and polici ultim leav the final impress of this place someth to be desired

a a local restaur you should tri to make sure your custom come back and feel welcomed

w wont be back and wont recommend this place to anyone


p pleas look at the 29 review not recommend at the bottom of their page they are an eye open look into how the owner treat their patron i dont know whi yelp doesnt recommend them but pleas read themthis restaur use to be great    it was recent sold and the new owner have made some chang that we realli feel have made this restaur a no go for my husband and me 

first i have given this place a second tri hope that the new owner was just get it togeth    we arriv on what appear to be a slow tuesday even   i had to wait for 5 minut befor be seat  this is a small place and they were not busi   i was final shown to a tabl which was next to the kitchenhello could you have given me a better tabl toward the back   

i sat and wait for my husband to join me about 10 minut later    the food we order was extrem salti    when the owner came over to ask how our meal was i told him the sauc was extrem salti and i couldnt eat it   he then get this told me that onli senior from sun citi anthem tell him this and they arent a veri good judg of food due to their age   what    he also said that he hear this about onc a monthreally

btw i order the chicken parm dinner and the present was aw and the chicken was press process chicken    

never return to this restaur     if i could give this restaur no star i would have done that in this reviewshould be advertis as allwewillmakeyoueat

y i eat a lot of sushi yes the sushi here is good yes it is allyoucaneat for 2195 for that you would think there would be more star but read the fine print 

you get charg for what you dont eat includ the extra bit of rice left behind

i can understand that if you order like 8 roll and leav sever piec from each it a wast but that was not the case for us out of the 4 of us 3 myself includ order allyoucaneat so they were alreadi get a decent amount of  from us what we didnt appreci is that everi time the guy came to our tabl he would warn us that we had to finish everyth we charg extra for leftov or we charg extra for uneaten rice or i told you we charg extra right 

the worst part was if he wasnt at our tabl warn us he never stop stare at us he would stand at his podium and watch us eat then hed go back to his sushi chef and make comment in japanes specif he kept his eye on me and it made me lose my appetit he serious made us feel like we were tri to pull some scam it was ridicul who want to be stare down and made to feel uncomfort while theyr tri to eat ive been a server and bartend for 5 year and i never treat ani of my custom even the deserv one the way the server there treat me 

im a laidback person and im generous with my review but this was by far my worst sushi experi i will not be backim never go to eat at this place again  we usual come here everi vega trip but this last trip we found a cockroach in our calamari  total disgust  

bewari guess after the rapid growth of busi pho kim long start have some issu on their qc and custom servic last time me and my girl went there we found a cock roach in the soup and told the server about it and guess what he came check out the bug bodi and then took it away then he claim that it was just some pepper they use to make soup and left a check then walk away i cant believ this is how they treat their custommy stomach hurt so bad as i write this review i am definit torch this place 

this place is terribl my whole famili got sick after eat here as i lay here feel full of regret and in disbelief of how disgust our dinner was here my stomach is extra tender and sore and my mouth is numb and dehydr 

im full vietnames and this place is such a huge embarrass and a disgrac to real authent vietnames food 

first offens  the goi cuon shrimp and pork spring roll summer roll were tini and bare had ani fill insid a piec of lettuc a tini bit of noodl a sliver of meat and 3 sliver of shrimp oh and that so call dip sauc was so gross super water down what a ripoff 

second offens  msg was never realli an issu for me and it never realli caus me ani problem until i ate here also my uncl is realli sensit to it and he had a lot of issu with his pho he didnt drink ani of his pho broth becaus it had too much msg and by the end of dinner he start to feel sick 

third offens  the nuoc cham fish saucedip sauc was so water down that i end up ask them for 3 bowl for my meal  but even 3 bowl was not enough and i final gave up it was disgust bland i was pretti much pour sugar water onto my rice 

fourth offens  my pork chop was dri and the marinad was bland the char on the pork chop tast artifici 

fifth offens  our tongu is all sort of numb and shrivel up after eat here i guess msg doe that to you were extrem weak thirsti and dehydr now 

sixth offens  the chow fun beef noodl in gravi hu tieu xao bo was so unappet and unapp i was in disbelief they serv it to us they overcook the chow fun noodl so they broke up into a billion of small piec when you tri to pick them up with chopstick the gravi was all wateri and goopi it was not tasti at all 

with so mani option in vega to get vietnames food late this place is not one of themi use to think this is my favorit pho in vega but now im not so sure  i recent went and order the dac biet with extra tendon  

the broth is pretti good it not as sweet as pho kim long and not as salti as pho saigon 8  the extra tendon i order was way undercook  so it was yellow and a littl chewy

th worst part of the meal was that my server decid to sit at the tabl next to me and start clip her finger nail  i was so worri that a littl piec of her nail was gonna get in my soup that it ruin my dine experi  she had her back to me and im pretti sure it was her fingernail she was clip but i kept worri it was her toenail  either way fing disgustbecaus mani known yelper like mr tofu we tri to go there tonight sad it wad close we decid to tri out tofu hut sinc we have never had their food befor  see that it has 35 star i thought it should be ok 

the furnitur was old and raggeti look especi the torn up cushion on the chair but nevertheless i should tri the food

th menu need some wipe done sinc it was cover with sauc  ewww

anyway we decid on the beef seafood sundubu and a plate of kalbi  when the older ladi waitress came back to take our order she was so impati and short  we want to understand their spici level so we ask if the spici level is korean spici she said it not that spici  so we continu to ask her at what level she would order it and she said she dont know sinc she doesnt eat spici  wtf  her illmanner and major bad attitud continu and i want to leav right there and then but my friend want to tri out the food at least  ahhhhh

when we paid the bill she walk by and hurri grab the receipt  i was piss that my friend tip her becaus truth she did not deserv a penni for the crappi servic she gave

food was subpar noth special  i will never ever come back to this crappi place with this crappi ajumma waitresslast april this busi chang hand befor it was authent tast done and was in the upper echelon of indian restaur in vega ah the good ole day 

the current establish is a farcri from the previous one first off the decor is well tacki and not even in a cheeki vegasway either it is a bit gaudi and done in a kitsch fashion resplend with do not touch sign on on touristi sitar and i dont think have a sink full of rock in the bathroom sink is veri hygien hello health code violat 

i understand menus cost money but to have halftorn cover with handwritten higher price scribbl in is not a good first impress my second impress was to have a skinni guy lean over me like a vultur tri to get me to order  i found out he was the new owner  and the other server look like she step out of biker bar  blue jean emporium replet with unkempt dang hair and see her reach over peopl food made me cring hair tie anyon 

against first judgement i make the plung and decid to stay sinc when doe an authent indian restaur serv mango lassi with ice and the garlic naan was thin almost tortillathin most burnt and tast like it was sit in the back for a bit under a heat lamp 

it got wors for the entre they were slop in their bowl with dirti side flatlysp and overcook and the rice was sit there like a mound of white blandless solid lamb curri isnt suppos to need a chainsaw to slice through and the chicken vindaloo was cut in strip a la fajita pound and dens and i thought the lamb was tough the waiterown ask how it was and i told i would tell him when we were done he never ask again 

how i long for the old place it was cozi and authent the exact opposit of what it has becom and anyon from somewher other than vega would be sore disappoint with this restaur as it is now instead of the samosa factori they should renam it the samosa tragedi 

mi tast bud agre ive been robit a wednesday night and i didnt feel like cook what a hungri guy suppos to do you guess it go out i check around to see whos avail for some good cheap  eat a friend of mine get back to me say she receiv a free birthday burger email from red robin whi not i say i dont mind be the buy one that me get one free that her person in this deal

w get there around 730 the place is huge busi it was normal i guess for a wednesday night worker ton 

tabl for two pleas i tell the young male host just a moment he repli he then goe around the half empti restaur talk to the differ server he come back and say pleas have a seat in the wait area i will seat you when the next tabl is available

i might of been a littl tipsi from drink befor hand but serious when the next tabl is avail i might not have the power like haley joel osment from sixth sens to see peopl in the empti tabl but what i can see is about 30 tabl which i could be sit at so we do what we can do wait

about 5 minut later we ask the host if we can sit in that empti tabl next to the nice peopl who seem to be enjoy their meal ill have to check with the server of that area say the host

about 8 minut later the manag come out and ask us if we have been help sinc were the onli peopl wait for a tabl i assum hes talk to us yes sir were wait for a tabl appar it stand room onli in here tonight i smirk come with me he say 

we walk across the restaur and he seat us in a booth sweet we go to the onli tabl in the restaur where the lamp over the tabl is out i dont mind the mood light but can we sit someplac where i can see my friend face i request i know i know im just ask for someth to happen to my food but im pretti much past that point

th nice waitress move us over a few tabl and everyth seem to be at peac in the univers now we crack open the menus and decid on two good look burger our order goe in and we wait and wait and wait

th famili next to us who appear to be wait for a long long time final tire of the wait and get up to leav the manag quick catch them and ask if he could do anyth for them the father explain that they have been wait for like 30 min for their food and their kid are hungri and they are leav to get food the manag offer to pick up their tab if they agre to sit and eat the famili leav great im stoked

eventu our food come out after a care inspect we eat we pay we leav 

oh and my burger was alright i got the a1 peppercorn burger the descript say sizzl hickorysmok bacon melt pepperjack chees a1® peppercorn spread crispi onion straw onion and tomato on an onion bun it a tast explosion

i was upset that i couldnt give this place zero star but i guess the burger was good enough for me to give them one star i also thought it was cool that if you sign up on their websit they send you a free burger coupon on your birthday fyi i read somewher that the peppercorn burger is one of the unhealthiest one you can order there great it just keep get better

to see the yummi burger check out the picthis place use to be my favorit chines restaur in vega what the hell happen i told myself that i wouldnt mind pay a 15 dollar cab rideon way to chinatown to eat here but it was terribl this time the won ton here use to be great the roast duck was awesom it just not the same anymor i hate to say this but i think mgms grand wok is a lot better than this place not onli thatth price are compar to casino restaur after the cab faresam woo is probabl more expens 

a real disappointment

for a real decent chines restaur off the striptri joy hous  they have the best soy sauc suprem shrimp  it more of a dinner place but i love their foodim veri disappoint with sam woo
thi use to be our must stop whenev we were in vega and my famili and i have been come here for a decade
wel the last few time i ate here i recal have a bad experi water left alon food came at super differ time waiter ignor usetc but noth beat our last experi which was last thursday 5102012

we arriv at 12 pm and be a weekday the place wasnt crowd at all we stood there wait to be seat for a coupl minut now we look around and no hostesswait to be found just peopl eat star at us then to our left we saw this ladi at the counter where you pay and she made direct eye contact with us and clear saw that were stand around dumb yet she reach her cell and sat down
i was heat final the waiter came and sat us down 

we wait some more for our water and by the time we were readi to order he was no where to be found onc again then we saw him took two tabl order and we arriv looong befor those peopl ugh

w order the combo duck pork and chicken big mistake

i honest could finish the whole thing alon how do you expect 4 peopl to eat from such small serv then we didnt get our rice after flag him down for rice he ask how mani wth 

our bill came to 34  rice was 430

what a disappoint end to our trip booooooso im just gonna say that this place has been close down multipl time by the health depart and my friend found a cockroach in his fri riceok so dont go here it that easi there were so mani thing wrong with my dine experi it hard to even figur out where to begin

1 servic i went on a sunday even and sat at the bar so i could watch footbal the poor bartend doe everyth here  she had 9 peopl at the bar was clean glass answer the phoneget our food  and she has to make all the drink for the waiter and when i say all the drink they come up to her for a coke they dont even have a fountain drink machin for the waiter to do it themselv  needless to say it took her a while to get my food order there also was a group of 3 guy that sat next to me that were order food and play video poker too hold that thought

2 drinksthey have video poker at the bar fine by me they dont comp your drink at the bar unheard of in vega i lost 40 buck and still paid full price for my 2 glass of wine

3 foodbread they have bread here base on the other review appar they do we didnt see ani bread at the bar carb free for us my meal came out befor my salad noooo bueno  also about 25 min after i order my meal arriv whi so long you ask becaus the bartend has to leav the bar and go get the food herself i have never in my life seen a restaur where the bartend goe and get her own food  the reason for my salad come out late the waiter were get there befor her and sinc the caesar are made to order i luck out  let talk about the foodi order the combin mealpetit fillet salad veggi  shrimp scampi to the tune of 65 

outback has better steak then this place it was realli dri see pix there wasnt even ani juic on the plate when i think of shrimp scampigarl white wine shrimp butter and parsley come to mind  this was not that  it was gelatin kinda like shark fin soup  the tail were still on the 5 shrimp  side of broccoli extrem undercook it need 2 or 3 more minut in the microwav from where it came from

guy next to me start laugh when my food arriv then i one up them told them i bet their app come out with their foodwel i was sort of right their food came out but there were no app with it so poor littl bartend now has to leav the bar for about the 5th time with 9 peopl at it psit onli seat 12 and onc again go get our food 

ps i complain about the order in which the food came out hostess did come talk to me she might have been the manag instead of apolog offer me a dessert take off a glass of wine she told the bartend if she start to get behind let her know and shell help out  i mention to her too the same thing happen to the guy next to me she offer no apolog and didnt even go speak with them

mind you we are drink eat and play at this place  my meal cost me well over 125 and was worth about 30 in my opinion

again stk or botero are much better option i also have no idea how anyon els had a good experi here as this might be the worst experi ive had in vega and mayb in a restaur periodi just receiv the worst servic experi in my year of eat at high end steak hous the food was good overal but i dont need to be disrespect and insult on top of mediocr servic when im drop a grand in your establishment

w had a group of 8 get togeth for a post viva las vega dinner pleas note that while this is a rockabilli convent we all dress up to the nine for a classi dinner experi at the golden steer when we arriv we ask to have separ check becaus as with mani high end steakhous the item are serv ala cart thus it make figur the bill at the end a nightmar with this mani peopl the excus was the comput system cant handl itand appar write it down on paper is too hard as well for the 200 dollar tip our group was not loud nor over demand yet had a lot of troubl get servic in general as other have mention in review recent 

as expect the chao begin when it come check time we get hand one copi of the check and are basic told you need to figur it out after lot of ask we final got multipl copi to tri and make sens of the confus bill this whole process take us 40 minut of struggl with the staff to clarifi the bill as if it just too much troubl for them despit the place be less than half full we end up miss a show in vega we want to attend deal with this fiasco

a we start pay the real fun begin we are told by one of the server in a veri condescend and rude tone well mayb they do that at denni but we dont do it here in regard to the poor servic with the check it seem to be a person shot base on be from the convent also when ask whi we are not be taken care of as is a server job he repli is it my job as if he would be do as littl as possibl for the 20 percent tip the older waiter over hear the convers was clear embarrass by his colleagu remarks

sorri but there are too mani other great steak hous in vega to deal with lazi and insult staff perhap he should not have been so judgment i work for a fortun 100 compani and like to take client to dinner i make a good live and i am high educ i dont eat at denni thank  i dont need this garbag guess who isnt take ani client here anymore

p denni probabl has a spot on their overnight staff for your rude server he obvious cant handl this gigspent our anniversari weekend in vega with anoth coupl  husband uncl is a local he say you gotta go to the golden steer forget about gordon ramsey place  he say you get the same thing for 65 a person so we all gave it a tri  

the atmospher remind me of an old time piano wine bar from the 70s80s but a littl run down in need of some updat  waiter was weird and had an attitud that kept grow throughout the night  he told us how hed been there quit a long time but had left for a while and come back etc make a point i guess that most of them were there for 20 year  

we got a bottl of wine and then order  i had the filet which was nice cook and the twice cook potato  the potato was actual about the worst i have ever had becaus it was obvious that it had sat in the oven either all day or for hour  it was complet burnt on the bottom but not in a good way  you know how you can total overdo a potato skin to complet crispi brow that it crack apart but it still tast good  ya well not like that this was burnt  could not cut it with a fork burnt  had to use a steak knife to get through it sooo cuz our waiter was weird with attitud i wasnt go to say anyth about my 10 potato  

the waiter came back at least 5 time aggress ask if we want anoth bottl of wine  it start to feel like it was a demand rather than a request which we all notic  at the end we all got dinner drinkscoffe and dessert  the drink came out right away and we had a nice convers while we wait for dessert  the restaur onli had 3 tabl and i notic 2 waiter and a coupl busser as well as the guy do the salad and dessert so when we finish the drink we ask where dessert was  we were hope to have it with the drink but  it like 30 minut or more later and the waiter respons was realli snotti that they onli had one of those dessert tray and the guy was go to get to us  we were there at 7 pm and the onli peopl on dessert at the time  

we didnt understand the realli negat reaction we were get so we were do our best to be respect respond with yes sir etc  it almost as if he mistook our kind for weak which seem to be happen a whole lot these day when you go out

so i watch the dessert guy make our dessert and i notic he was make cherri jubile instead of the banana foster we order so i said someth about it in a veri nice way lol that doesnt seem to matter  the respons was almost like are you ef kid me  this bitch make a mistak i gotta fix  he didnt say that but his bodi languag sure did  the dessert guy went away the waiter come back with more attitud and do you want anoth bottl of wine again  he seem piss at us that the guy was make cherri and that we didnt want that as well  

they final made it right and i tast one bite and not good  we make it better at home  everyon at tabl agre we make it better so good thing i got the tiramisu becaus that was pretti good

thi is the import part  i would never have bother write ani of this until this part happen  the waiter bring the bill and most of the time my husband just take care of it but this time i had a funni feel about the waiter so i look at it and thank the lord i did becaus that dude doubl charg us and charg us extra for stuff that alreadi came with etc for instanc my husband order asparagus with hollandais sauc 11  the waiter charg us for 2 of those 22  hollandais sauc 5x 2  10 so his asparagus was 32

when we point out the error to the waiter he seem intens aggrav  he respond veri quick like he was expect it  i bet he was  i bet they do that all night long  he said oh when they put it in they must have made a mistak like someon els rang his order in and like it happen and he will have to go straighten them out  bill came back minus 150 but i am posit we still paid too much becaus that extra sauc crap didnt hit me til we got home that the asparagus alreadi had hollandais on it and i just look it up on the menu to be sure and yep sure enough  

bottom line  these peopl can cook a steak but so can the keg and firebird etc

do not trust your waiter  go over your bill    they are look for suckers

fair restaur price on bottl of wine

non of us would ever returni call to inquir about their menu and was meet with some resist the person who answer the phone would onli tell me to come in and see the decor and and menu i thought it was a joke and ask again but to no avail didnt get anywher this place put a bad tast in my mouthsshthis was the worst persian food i have ever had the servic was even wors than the food i will never go there again i have been in mani persian restaur in la and the bay area this one stand at the bottom of the list i recommend anyth els but habibi stop write review on yelp becaus it was too time consum but after eat at this restaur i cant help but tell the world about our experi one that i hope will make other peopl wari of come here

w arriv at osaka on a typic saturday afternoon 1pmish and was shown a tabl in the back room where the tabl were larger  as we walk past the first room upon enter i notic that it was fair empti but it didnt struck me as odd sinc there are so mani restaur to choos from in las vegas

w sat down and were given multipl menus each one with someth differ in it  i guess this could be a good thing sinc i like have lot of choic  we order our drink hot green tea and ice green tea and brows the menus for omakas which we heard from someon ahem that it is worth come here for

aft everyon in our parti arriv there were 5 of us we ask the waitress about their omakas and she complet hesit i thought that was strang consid this should be a simpl question  she said shell be right back so we sat there think mayb shes just new or someth  but even so oo

sh came back and in broken english ask us if we want sashimi or sushi and we said a littl of both  she then proceed to say that it 100 for all four peopl that want it and i confirm if it was 100 per person or if it was 100 for all four peopl becaus that make a huge differ  she said 100 for four peopl so we agreed

aft order the omakas  i realiz that she must have order us the plate of normal sashimisushi that was on the menu  i rememb see 50 for 2 peopl for someth so with 4 peopl she just doubl it  i thought sure whi not  we were go to tri their assort of roll but given that the omakas is suppos to be good i decid to give it a try

th first plate of sashimi came out look decent  im not too familiar with the name and the translat for the type of fish so im just go to say that i tri just about everyth on the menu and onli a coupl item tast okay  there were quit a few nasti bite in between includ one in which i had to spit out  now im not a sushi snob at all but when i have to do that it mean it not good  my companion agre and anoth person had to go thru that ritual later on in the meal as well said one of the fish tast graini too  fortun our napkin were right in front of us  

as an addit note we receiv 2 addit plate of sushi roll which were suppos to be part of the omakas deal  we thought it was just soso as well perhap even bad

at the end of the meal we notic the 100  70 on top of our other charg  we ask about the 70 and they said it was for the 2 plate of sushi roll that accompani our sashimi omakas plate needless to say that 70 was a surpris becaus we were told  it was 100 for four peopl  if they told us they were go to bring addit sushi plate for 35 each i think we wouldv either said no or order or own roll  ugh  i hate when messup like this happen

w told our waitress about the issu and she left to talk to the ownermgr  the ownermgr came by quit awhil later to ask us what the issu was  we explain clear about the unexpect charg and the miscommun but he wouldnt budg  in fact he brought up how good of a qualiti the fish were and given that this is still a good deal  the whole time i kept think if i should tell the truth about the qualiti of his fish but i kept my mouth shut in case he was go to give us a break

i suppos we all couldv said someth becaus at the end noth happen out of the negoti  he wouldnt even take the charg of one 35 plate of sushi off so we paid left and vow never to come back  

ive had a lot of sushi befor but i would rank this as the worst sushi and experi ever  there are a ton of other great sushi restaur in vega so look it up on yelp and go there  you will not regret itinconsist servic seem to be what komol is serv up late at the time i write this im current hold the duke status on the yelp app from all my checkin and ive been a fan of komol for almost 2 year now servic over that time has seen some rough spot but my visit today was a first i walk out without have been serv the main part of my order 

a littl backstori while komol has an extens menu with great offer like their curri and vegetarian fare it the chili mint chicken that my comfort food of choic ive order it so much that most of the staff know my orderthey dont even have to hand me a menu 

so yes i know komol and when they are on their game they total blow away their competit across the park lot but then you get day like today where you ask for an extra egg roll and never get it or it take them 35 minut to attempt to put out a simpl plate of chili mint chicken that can normal be done in under half the time i understand the place get busi or they have call in order but ive been there when the place was even busier and didnt see the delay i had today and what make it even more frustrat is my last visit was perfect in almost everi way but the visit befor that was almost as bad as todayand this is all in the past 2 week 

thank there is a mcdonald down the street so a quick unhealthi big mac fri and a sweet tea kept me from go back to work hungri but now that i no longer have an empti stomach i wonder how can i get a messag across to the komol staff that their servic need to improv the onli option i have is to drop some starsand express my frustrat where it will get notic and hope act upon 

come on komolfix this mess until they make some changesyeah eek me think not one star territori seem appropri it harshbut then again i didnt feel so hot leav hungri eitheri was veri surpris by all the high mark this place got  i just recent went here with my hub and mom  we were veri disappoint on what we got  we went here by chanc becaus we need to eat i didnt exact know where seafood citi was and i didnt want to drive up and down sahara  come from sd and i have mani select of differ turo turo point point place and never realli came upon a place that wasnt good  so i didnt think much of this place on not be good  there were ppl insid eating

first off they make you get a tray  the tray i got smell like it was wipe with a wet dirti towel  it had a disgust sour smell and i didnt understand whi they want ppl to eat with it  the guy behind the counter was pretti adam on us get a tray  i got the tray but i didnt want to put my food down on it  so gross

what i got
i decid on their beef steak  the guy ask if i want sabaw okay the sauc on my rice heck ya  i just want one entre choic with my rice  

whi it wasnt good
first the rice  it seem like old rice they reheat and put too much water on becaus it got too dri out  my beef steak wasnt good at all  the sauc of the beef steak seem too oili and it didnt tast fresh  it also tast like it was cook a long time ago and just reheat  they just look like they cut up fresh onion and top with it to look like it was recent cook 

what the hub got
h got paksiw na lechon and sinigang na halibut  yea that right they put halibut in with the sinigang  i never had and now i know whi  if your go to make ani type of fish sinigangfricken make it with bangus  i know they had bangus becaus they had one all fri up in the front    

whi it wasnt good
mi husband is on of those filipino who love realli sour sinigang  when he ask the guy if it was extra sour the guy had no hesit to say yes  when hub went to tri it the sabaw soup was bare sour  he also agre to not eat sinigang with halibut it just didnt tast right  as for his paksiw that also tast like it was cook a long time ago and just reheat  the sauc of the paksiw was way over power and didnt tast that good either

what mom got
sh also got the sinigang and she also got afritada  i didnt tast it becaus i was alreadi disgust with my food and my husband  i doubt that tast ani better 

i dont know if they were lazi to cook stuff for a saturday even and again and just reheat old food  i surpris that so mani ppl like the food from here  but i will definit not come here again and will make it a point to find seafood citi becaus i heard there are more place to eat around there  

ppl from vega or ppl visit vegasdont go hereseriouslyyour lolamomauntielolodaduncl or youself who know who to cook will be disappoint with the food from here  this is not how filipino food should tast likeepic food fail  zero stars

i came here after check yelp and see friend sing the prais of thai grill i went in excit hungri and so happi to find a wellreceiv place not horribl far from where i work the bar was set high sure but not unreason so

i order the shrimp and veggi tempura to nosh on while i wait for my friend to show up she was drive an even longer distanc but i was too hungri to wait i had a shrimp that seem too soft and a coupl small piec of zucchini a this was not tempura batter there were two style of batterbread on the plate b the batter was so thick that there were wet pocket of uncook batter on the insid c some of the piec look like they had been refri at some point

when m show up she ask me what the hell i was eat and i explain that i was send it back with the abov explan the waitress was nice enough to listen to me and replac it with some thai dumpl too larg dri and with a wrapper that was soggi and fall apart they did have an ok flavor but it was just ok

th thom kha soup was decent not my favorit but edibl they love their fish sauc here the flavor are way too obvious other than that and my person prefer that it be a tad creamier it was the spice level i want and general ok definit the highlight and that not say much today

th shrimp panang damn near kill me and not in a good way i took some of just the curri then with some veget so far i kinda like it a littl bland but i figur i could spice it up a bit then i had a shrimp even as i bit into it i knew it was go to be a problem the shrimp was bare cook take all the sauc off of it and it was still grey transluc and in need of more time in the kitchen

w point that out and end the meal thank i had allergi med in the car i had a few decent bite of the curri in which the shrimp was cook then the shrimp itself and i question the tempura too bad juju and a bad reaction

th cook appar said this was her specialti this is how she alway doe it noth about the respons indic a bad day or an off dish or an off ingredient

th waitress was nice enough but that was the best thing about the whole experi the servic was slooooooooooow 2 hour for lunch and at one point i had to offer to come to her to get her help we had to ask for water refil then after the meal is over and were sort out the semiok part we are inform that they can onli take cash today of which neither of us had ani on us becaus their system was broken when we said we onli had card with us she want to take a card and run it on a system in the back no receipt mind you and what system would this be and we could come back and sign for it later

i said i wasnt comfort with that arrang and wonder whi no one said anyth dure the two hour we were there that and given the failur of the whole experi found us suggest that this meal be taken care of

not just no but hell no it was my first and last time there disappoint doesnt begin to cover itcheyenn cross location
thi is a pretti decent walmart at least they keep all the shit pick up off the floor but they still have the same ada employe who dont give a shit about anyth i mean when you ask a worker for help  they say i dont work in this or that dept and they walk away they should be pick up their last check  go home serious peopl it not real hard to do your job give a littli dont know who think this is real bbq they must have either 1 never eaten real bbq or 2 never had food with flavor before

thi crap is disgust bad locat no flavor brisket sandwich had no flavor or bbq sauc and all fatti meat the tritip was just a few slice of fatti meat with no flavorth hus puppi were ok kinda burnt for 25 buck id rather eat anywher els what a wast of time and moneyi had a realli bad experi here 

i had been die to tri the appl pancak that i had heard mani good thing about so i head to the origin pancak hous the servic was terribl the server practic forgot my tabl exist i had to wait a long time for anyon to even approach the tabl when she final did i order a coffe and the appl pancak my coffe came out and ew there was lipstick on the cup unfortun i didnt notic until the waitress had alreadi wander away from the tabl and when i was final abl to get her attent again it took her far too long to return with a fresh cup 

when my pancak arriv it was enorm i look down to get my fork in prepar of my first bite of appley good and was appal to find my fork was dirti i again had to tri to get my waitress attent to replac my fork which again took forev  final im readi to eat the flavor was noth spectacular and i becam bore about three bite in 

i realli dont have too mani posit thing to say about this place and cant say im particular motiv to tri it again after this negat breakfast experithis place use to be good about a year or more ago it seem to me they have chang ownership or manag or someth the food qualiti is bad now they have a menu item that has a bunch of bacon the bacon use to be crispi and thick not it couldnt be more thin and under cook they give you a huge plate with two item on it and it make it look like they forgot part of your meal ive tri everyth here noth is good 

i had the sausag and hash brown the hash was undercook despit ask for it to be crispi the sausag was cold seem they put it onto the griddl frozen and it didnt cook all the way or someth the pancak alon are okay the thing about pancak waffl and french toast are they are onli as good as their syrup well the syrup is the cheapest tast syrup substitut ive ever had you can tast the sugar corn syrup in it it has no smoki or mapley flavor to it not even fake flavor 

servic is fine noth to get excit about mayb 35 star the food is just so horribl that it brought the rate down that much 
mi famili and i have decid we will not return unless there are no other option my warn is just becaus you had it befor doesnt mean it is close to the same i mean there wasnt even a piec of orang or parsley or melon on my plate like there usual is when you order breakfast at ani other breakfast placethis place has given me one of my best cross cultur misunderstand and i dont mean that in a good way what a flop mr chop chop 

mi wife and i went there for lunch recent and when we walk in there on a tabl off to the side was this amaz dish sit there beckon to us it had this whole fri fish and was surround by bok choy and beauti steam veget it gave off this spici rich aroma i thought it was an offer tabl 

so i say to the gal i want some of that she repli oh that not on the menu i said oh too bad are you sure to which she say that a special tabl ahhhhhh so we order some item we think will be close to as good as that smell 

what we got was won ton soup it was a disappoint it was gummi the meat was harden the broth tasteless we also got some dish that was so unmemor that all i rememb is that is was dri flat tast and the rice crunchi i was get realli put off at that point then the kicker the chef and all the worker sat down at the beauti decor tabl and proceed to consum the fish dish with gusto and relish 

but we the custom were succinct ignor and feed what amount to a rice bowl to go serv that was overpr horribl cook and poor serv way to go mr chop chop 

not onli did i feel cheat on what you serv but you save the best for yourself right in front of pay custom and myself tell me what you think of your busi and the rest of your food 

the best i can say is you suck suck mr chop chopthe person who recommend this place either has veri low culinari expect or a pervert sens of humor both the tacki threadbar decor and low price should have tip us off to what lay in store for us  a spread that was mediocr at best with food that was overcook underseason except for salt    lot and lot of salt and lukewarm fatti grist meat greasi chicken can veget and wilt salad were among the better offer and strawberri jello was the best dessert we felt like we had wander into a pot luck supper in a whitetrash trailer park each night has a differ theme but it seem unlik they could pull off anyth as exot as spaghetti and meatbal or enchilada at 999 theyr charg about 6 too muchmy experi at grape street tonight was veri disappoint becaus of the servic my boyfriend and i receiv when we first arriv to the restaur there was a group of peopl wait to be seat and the hostess was nowher to be found for about 5 minut which is complet understand as i work at a restaur myself she was pretti nice and courteous and thank us for wait multipl time the restaur was veri beauti the ambianc of it was romant and we had a nice tabl by the window which was great becaus we were celebr an anniversari but as soon as we got sat thing went downhil our server seem veri unhappi to serv us after we mention we had bought the 54 dollar 3 cours meal groupon which i am not happi about and will bring up later not onc did he smile at us and his respons to our question were one word it felt immedi uncomfort i assum that mayb he was have a bad day or someth but nope we saw that he was smile at other tabl like the tabl right next to us and peopl at the bar but for some reason it felt like he did not like us at all i would not say our server was rude but he was definit not nice to us after our meal he drop the check by say check no thank you or anyth  the onli thing that was good about him was that he was attent he did check on us everi onc in awhil with a you guy ok 

now to the groupon my bill would have normal came out to 77 dollar with the appet 2 main cours 2 glass of wine and 1 dessert i did not save much with my groupon cost 54 dollar which is fine becaus save ani money is good  but no where on the fine print anywher doe it say tip will be ad on it own the server ad gratuiti and make it an extra 20 dollar total that i spent here 74 dollar if the groupon had state that there was a requir gratuiti percentag that was fix on the bill this would have been a bit more fair oh and fyi with the servic we got this definit was not worth it 

oh and besid the servic the food was okay i order the tripl cream brie pasta it was good but veri unhealthi and i will need day of gym time to work off that meal the bread pud dessert was okay i feel like i have had better bread pud at vega buffetim probabl go to get rake across the coal sinc this is def a local favorite

good luck you are go to need it 

brien mceahernwhere do i begin my husband and famili and i have been come to mb for year we even had our wed rehears dinner here but it has just continu to go down hill this is what happen yesterday
  1 when i arriv on time for my reserv there were onli two tabl occupi on the upper patio but the hostess proceed to sit me at an end tabl right near the walkway cram in by the planter certain this was not a tabl anyon would want to sit at unless it was the onli option  the waiter move my tabl upon request
  2 my father was serv water and ask for lemon upon wait about 1015 minut for lemon my mother had to liter summon the waiter to our tabl to request the lemon again his respons it is be cut  it seem veri odd that an hour in to brunch servic they dont have lemon alreadi cut 
  3 i order a cup of coffe it took 20 minut to get a plain cup of coffee
  4 we ask for bread with our mussel which a nice waiterbuss brought but onli after tell us that the new manag said no bread with brunch servic 
  5 my dad french toast might as well have been bread and jam  it was dri bland and cold
  6 the manag came to refil my mimosa and overflow champagn all over my place set but he did not return with a towel to clean it up instead i had to take napkin from the empti tabl next to us
  7 my brother order the crab and asparagus benedict which is on the menu but was brought what look like a sloppi regular egg benedict which is not even on the menu  upon receiv the correct meal his egg were so undercook that he could not even eat it  this is not onli a lack of concern for custom but a serious health risk you would think that given the recent salmonella outbreak at a differ restaur they would be extra cautious when serv food the tabl next to our sent their meal back as the egg were far too undercook too 
  8 when i final got up to speak with the manag insid he was snotti and rude which i can onli assum is a trait he learn from the owner who spend more time drink wine with custom than manag their restaurant
  9 upon receiv the bill my brother benedict was still on the check  consid it was screw up by the staff and then replac with someth ined i had to request that it be remov ani good restaur owner andor manag know that you comp part of the meal if it is incorrect 

last the femal owner decid that it would be smart to talk to my mother and i in the restroom about our disgust excus for brunch but instead of be concern and ask what happen immedi she had the gaul to suggest that this restaur is not a fit for you and you should not come back  frank after what happen today i never want to come back to mb 

mb need a refresh in manag and the first lesson the custom is alway right  we had an aw brunch today and the owner could have care less  instead she tri to make up some stori about how we were loud and peopl complain  no one was loud at least not until she bombard us in the bathroom 

it has to be said that when other tabl around us were upset about their food and servic too see lauren gs review i believ the peopl complain about us were the wait staff and manag becaus they did not like be calledout on the horribl servic and crappi food specif the use of frozen potato be pass off as breakfast potato for a place pretend to be upscal and highqual everyth today was appalthis is an old time restaur that has some charm  i have been a regular at this place for year but i have notic that the last year or so the manag and owner simpli dont care ani more   the cook cant get the temperatur of a steak right and alway tri to make you feel that you dont understand the differ between mid rare and mid well  

i normal go to the restaur for their prime rib which use to be in my opinion the best in town  the problem now is that they tri to pass medium as rare  the cook attitud is horribl and as i said the owner is never there and nobodi care except for a coupl of server that are helpless to do anything

their lunch have gone down hill as well this place has no charm left and is not worth spend your money ati will never set foot in this place again worst servic ever wait 25 minut to even get notic by the server 

i was so excit that i was final go to tri this place out sinc i drive by it all the time and want a place that serv some prime rib total disappoint when we were seat no one approach my fianc and i after see this famili get servic befor us i was like oh hell no that did not just happen i went to the hostess to tell her weve been sit here for 20 minut and no one has approach us not even a drink order or anyth i want to walk out she final got the server but the server did not apolog for the wait or anyth this place wasnt even pack she ask for our drink order and i told her weve been readi to order i order the prime rib with the twice bake potato it was okay  

bob taylor ranch hous you total disappoint meim so glad this place decid to treat my friend and i like scum i love that

that isnt funnii truli hate to give a bad review to a neighborhood place that ive been to mani time befor  but tonight dinner was unbearable

w usual order kebab  chicken for my husband and kafta or chicken for me  but tonight we decid to shake thing up and the coupon did us in  there was one from one of the mailer offer two dinner for 1495  kebab wasnt one of the choic but chicken shawarma was  how differ could it be from chicken kebab which weve alway liked

step 1  call to order for takeout  kid on the other end im not sure we have enough rice left for two dinner  it 815 they close i think at 10  put me on hold for quit a while  final  yes we do  so i order them with one vinaigrett and one creami for the salad dress  five minut and itll be readi  no prob we live close by

hubbi sick so i pick up the food  back home i open my contain to see the usual yellow rice pickl cabbag and turnip chop raw red onion the usual hard driedout pita and a whole mess of dri and shrivel chicken piec  i tast one of them  first i choke on the dryness then my mouth shrivel from the salt  so much of it that two piec and my lip were sting as if i were do a dead man float in the dead sea  it was complet inedible

it was when i notic that the salad  fresh romain two slice of cuke and one lone grape tomato  came with not one but two vinaigrett  no creami for me  i was then complet piss and call the restaur  got the same kid whod taken my order and ask to speak with the manager

i was put on hold twice  the second time for a verrrryyyy long time  how big is this tini place that he cant find the manag  final the clerk get back on to tell me that the manag isnt there and he doesnt have the author to issu ani refund  but the manag will call me later this even if not then tomorrow  he didnt call tonight so im wait until late tomorrow afternoon to post this review  i suspect that i will have wait for nothing

wel i was right to wait  i never heard from sultan grill  i had plan to give this meal two star becaus i do like the chop veggi and the salad when i have the dress i order  but i believ that a food busi shouldnt be in the busi of sell ined food and if they do they have a duti to respond to complaint  im not even ask for a free meal just an acknowledg that they drop the ball  a busi that doe not do this doesnt deserv ani star so ive revis my rate downwardappar the hooter hotel has 24hour 3 blackjack tabl i mean there are banner post against the build outsid there are sign abov the slot machinesth hooter hotel is suppos to have 24hour 3 blackjack tables

mi friend and i walk into the hooter hotel
w look for these 3 blackjack tables

ther were no 3 blackjack tables

on star for fals promot 
i was look forward to cheap gambl toohere my lil adventur at hooter casino hotel

w had been in town for 2 day and were stay at ti  on our trip 6 month ago my wife and i went to hooter and enjoy play on the cheap 21 tabl  my wife suggest let go down to hooter and tri the chicken wing again to see if last time shitti wing was a fluke and play some cheap tabl  it was a plan we fill up our yard we bought from walgreen and start walk to hooter  onc we got there the line for food was about 45 minut  we had no interest in wait that long for anoth possibl let down

plan b  cheap tabl it is  although the cheapest tabl we could find was 10 min  at this point we were happi to just be abl to sit next to each other at the tabl and play  we realli didnt wanna play that much per hand so we laid down 20 and said screw it  welllllll about  two hour later we were both up to 200 dollar each  we were so shock we just had to keep go  after lose a few and win a few and feel drunk we mutual agre it was time to cash in and mosey back toward the ti where the bed was much closer  

from the point of get color up to walk to the cashier i black out for about the next 1011 hour and was out of commiss about a day and a half  i didnt rememb a damn thing from walk out of the door to get in a cab to walk to my bedroom and pass out  it turn out at some point it was rufi  now pleas understand folk i can handl my liquor quit well and often wake up earli the next day outta habit and becaus of my daughter  the next day my bodi was absolut exhaust my wife told me my pupil were blast and i simpli did not feel right  this was no hang over that my bodi was tri to kick  

as fun as it was to win money the fact that someon had a differ night plan out for us was kinda disturb  now here i am post my review and im feel like an ass for not yelp this place befor i came here  you dont see too mani review as bad as this place has  and for damn good reason i see

raymond b mention he was get eye the whole time for give his wife money right  the pit boss at the tabl was give me and my wife the eye after we start win that much money almost give us a feel like we shouldnt be win money anymor  we play 10 tabl at the ti a few night later and had equal as fun of a time and play till 6am  

avoid hooter it not worth the risk of get drugive stay in some of the worst roach infest seasid motel in california and this was easili the worst hotel ive ever been in 

it las vega so you realli arent go to spend a ton of time in your room howev the abil to shower befor you go out is sort of a big deal the shower in our room wouldnt drain and quick fill up with water i tri take a pen and cram it down the drain to see if i could fix it  i pull the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it 

the drain was plug up with some bitch entir weav or someth perhap a dog we call down to the front desk and were transfer to the wrong depart transfer to a voic mail and hung up on twice befor we were abl to get them to send someon out 

they sent out two mainten guy to fix it and they spent a half hour blow air down the drain with a hand pump this did noth they left say it was still slow but work a littl better it didnt all it did was make us late 

it wasnt just the bathtub malfunct that was a problem the place was disgust there was some sort of small turd near the entri the vent in the bathroom look like there was a 1000 year old dead rat insid the air condition sound like an asthmat and the bust tile beneath it was cover in dirt there were all sort of stain all over the carpet and anyth with a surfac was cover in layer of old dirt top of door frame mirror headboard etc 

everi shower curtain ring was broken as well  it felt like some sort of joke  like we were on some sort of realiti show someon just want to see us crack

sad the room was 150 per night becaus we got there on a busi weekend i suppos other peopl onlin had report pay in the 30s for their room i wouldnt have felt right pay 30 ani more than i felt right pay 150 i took pictur of everyth and brought them downstair in the morn to the manag who act relat nice i show her the pictur on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of clean staff who look at them and shrug at me dismissively

in the end they comp my room they shouldv given us ticket to someth or gambl money or offer a free night in one of their nicer suit had they done anyth more than comp the room i wouldv tri to be a littl more understand as it stand though they did not 

i paid noth for this room in the end and it damn near ruin my vacat it not worth it at 150 90 60 30 dollar not even zero 

if your a colleg kid who is happi drink bud your idea of ballin is win 50 cent in the penni slot and you are in vega to throw televis through window and pee in the hallway you have found your ideal hotel for a cheap thrill get in the elev and ride it as high as it will go  you will fear for your life

fuck this placewent here in aug veri cheesi what you expect from hooter enough saidas a vega local you expect good servic right wrong last night myself and my girlfriend went in what a mistak we ate in the hooter restur like we usual do when we visit the casino so we order out food curley fri with chees sauc for an app philli steak and chees no onion for my girlfriend and 10 wing bread mild for myself 

about 20 min after we order all the food came out at onc the fri were ice cold and hard as a rock my girlfriend sandwhich had onion on it and my wing were over cook as per usual on a slow night we have to stop a hostess to find our waitress  who was horrid miser to come over my girlfriend sent her food back and after about 10 more mintu she get her food 

she goe to move her pickl out from under her fri becaus come on who put a cold pickl under fri right and much to both of our surpris there is a 3 inch long piec of black hair stuck to her pickl so we call the manag to come over 

we explain the situat to david and he offer to remak the food for a third time and claim to see no hair after i pick up the pickl and show it to him we say no we dont want to we want to leav so he say were more than welcom to leav our food has been comp 

so we leav as we are leav i see david talk to anoth guy who keep look over at me and nod his head so i stop david walk back over to me and i ask what the problem was he said noth but you are more than welcom not to return to the restur i ask him whi he said oh becaus we obvisiouli cant make you peopl happi ok fine 

i go back today and speak with bill the general manag he also tell me everi time you peopl are in here there alway an issu you are alway talk to a manag or complain about someth it would be in your best interest not to come back 

ok first off the custom is alway right second you peopl is kind of demean to me and i take that as an insult third i myself and my girlfriend know most of the peopl in the restur person that whi were alway talk to manag 

i will not be return to hooter anymor until the higher manag staff is chang or they will admit they were in the wrong i have never been treat so poor in my life and will make sure this get out to hooter of americai know this isnt burger king where you make it my way but when i ask for no mayo and you say ok i assum you are confirm that you understand and are acknowledg that there will be no mayo on my sandwich

i realli dont see how it can be so difficult to make a hand of burgers

i mean the place is deadnobodi insid or  in the drivethru

i realli have low expect of the food here but ive come to expect so much more of the servic after all this is the onli fastfood place in the chinatown neighborhood where most everyon speak english

i use to count on this place for midnight munchi with some deepfri taco for 1 but now im just too piss too go backpuke palace

advisori this locat only

i use to come here on my lunch break becaus it was right next to where i use to work i would walk here almost onc a weekjust for conveni we onli got a half hour lunch so i had to go somewher close and the onli other option was mc donald and im not a big fan 

so hmmm where do i begin yes it that bad 

ok the 1st time i came here i order a bacon chees burger combo which after tax was like 800bucksomg it took 20 minut for me to get my order which meant i had to scarf this nasti sicken burger down in 5 min becaus i still had to walk back to work and clock in 

not to mention on top of it take forev to cook it was under cook i saw it was rare pink i was so piss off and had no time to complain i just ate the thing and left to work 

i tri this place a few more time onli becaus i didnt have time to eat anywher els 

the second time i ate here i tri there chicken strip ummm they were tasti but had blue dot stream through themnot sure what that was but hey im still live 

after tri various item i came to realiz the onli tasti and safe thing to order was their chili chees fri which after tax came to almost 6 buck for a larg 

luckili i do not nearbi anymor and will not be return 

nasti food 
over price 
dirti and filthi dine in 
drug out employe 

ps the employe are all nasti and drug out 

i wit an employe with dirti finger nail also no wash of hand or glove while touch raw and cook food this locat seem more of a health depart issu than anyth els 

pleas if you can avoid eat at this dairi queen pleas avoid it at all costthis was onli the second time i have been to cathay hous i came for dim sum year ago and didnt have much of a desir to return but i couldnt resist give them anoth chanc recently

w arriv around noon and they werent too busi i felt rush to order even though we kept tell them we want to wait for our entir parti to be seat we order hot tea and water all around and then proceed to order from the cart that came around 

they push the ginger scallion lobster with pasta on us and although a good valu at 1599 it had to be reheat befor they serv it to us the lobster was chewi and the noodl felt like total filler didnt have much flavor and were overcook the highlight from our meal were the custard bun and crab ball the rib had to be reheat for us befor serv which was a turn off

th rest of the item we order werent veri memor and i wouldnt recommend most if ani of it the coconut bun egg custard bbq pork bun and smelt were all complet forgettable

servic was ok although refil were a littl hard to come by for our water and tea there are other dim sum place in town i prefer with fresher item so i dont see myself come back ani time sooni drive by this place everyday on the way to work and it alway smell so delici when i drive by in the afternoon but i think the catch is that ani caveman can throw a slab of meat on a hot surfac and our inner carnivor will growl a quick yummmmm and then move on i wish i would have taken the move on advic in this case 

i suggest we order lunch from this place for work and we pass the menu around in amaz at all of the option that we had and the order began onc lunch was pick up and brought back we all quick dug in and then we all quick stop dig in there was a mix of thing order chicken wrap 3 piec plate and side like mac and chees and ceaser salads

i am not over picki but i will say the chicken in my wrap was extrem dri and there was absolut no flavor to the entir wrap the cowork to my right stop eat his plain chicken and chees wrap after he pull 4 bone out of it and to top it off one of my other co worker could not stand to eat his mac and chees becaus it was so runni 

i apolog now to all of you nevada chicken lover that may be read this but this place was absolut horribl and i think we will be go back to order el pollo loco as sad as that isahhhhh just got home after get drive thru at this locat i realli consid turn around and go back but gave up on the thought i order a spici chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fri with a side of bbq sauc 

here what i got

a spici chicken sandwich with ton of mayo and a broken bun becaus of all the disgust white shit everywher 
a medium fri that was liter half full honest me say it was half full was exagger it was about a third full 
and guess what no bbq sauc but an open ketchup packet that got everywher 

bravo bravo and this is whi i rare eat fast foodi appreci sur bartend as much as the next person but im sincer when i say fuck the fuck lava loung  what i onc thought was an amaz respit from the campus crap that is locat near univers ave i have just realiz is full of lame ass poseur and bull shit bouncer case in point my dear friend was assault today by a bouncer for insist that he drink his drink he just paid for at 130 am befor legal bar time but after lava bar time  despit the fact that the regular and employe were allow to finish and order more beverag we were violent and rude usher outsid   the bouncer grab my dear friend by his arm rip his shirt  forc him to drop his drink and then threw him outsid  the peopl outsid assault him further until someon sober enough final listen to us and realiz that we were not drunk just peopl who enjoy beer and unfortun thought we should enjoy it at this odious establishment
fuck this place do not come here unless you enjoy be harass becaus your not a pierc tattoo regularmy overal experi with jolli bob was pleasant and im disappoint give them one star but the servic was so appal that this review is necessari 

the major of the even was fine i was in a larg group for my friend birthday for some reason it was a big problem for them to squish 2 tabl togeth so our two tabl sat kiddi corner from each other our tabl had fair decent servic and they were even kind enough to honor our request from bread 2 time the other tabl had slower servic and kind of a snotti waitress howev the birthday girl was at the other tabl and was present with a birthday shot which made up for the aloof attitud 

the food was decent the bread was divin our main cours were ok and the drink were pretti good we all order a varieti of blend cocktail and fruiti beverag 

so we were all readi to leav and on our way out the door when the waitress stop two in our parti and question whether their servic was adequ becaus they felt their tip was lower than the servic they provid they felt that they went abov and beyond by tri to seat us togeth and go out of their way to give the birthday girl a shot even though they made it seem as though it was a typic jolli bob birthday custom it your birthday you get a free shot or a free slice of pie my friend were truli appal by this confront and repli the tip reflect the service

aft the servic so rude approach our group the 3 5 star rate i previous consid was shot 1 star for horrend waitstaff 

also if your a cash onli establish you should consid more cashfriend priceim a madison nativ and have been to jolli bob a few time it not a terribl place but tonight as i was walk in i saw a long dress code i thought it was a joke at first becaus in addit to no doorag they said that no white shirt were allow i thought they couldnt be serious

that is until i got turn away at the door im a white guy but i can recogn that polici like this are clear racist theyr tri to keep out ghetto guy and have end up with a laughabl dress code i honest felt like i was in the 50s and segreg was in full forc  it was just a bizarr sad experi especi after live in brazil for 3 years

add to this the fact that as i stood there at the door tri to get my sister attent i saw a woman in a white shirt and point her out to the bouncer the code is onli for men he said ok that make a lot of sense

thi is a racist polici that peopl shouldnt support im definit not go in there again  no matter what im weari am sorri to give this review but over a year later this experi still stick out in my head my boyfriend and i went in to jamerica and the owner was right at the front chat up some peopl we stood for a minut befor decid to seat ourselv we sat for a few more minut befor get our own menus we then help ourselv to our own drink from the cooler after about 10 minut of not be acknowledg by the owner or anyon for that matter who was mayb 5 feet away we walk out and went a block down to jolli bob the owner and his friend stare at us as we walk out but what did they expect i think it was the first time they even look at us i have heard the food is great i dont know i wouldnt go back becaus i felt realli disrespect and jolli bob is also amaz caribbean food and so nearbiparthenon was recommend to me by a friend so i decid to final check it out but despit the prais for their gyro i was complet disappoint by the food here

in fact it was practic ined i took mayb two or three bite befor i had to quit and throw it away 

i went with the classic gyro that serv with tomato and onion and lettuc with sauc on the side and it was the most disgust thing ive eaten probabl ever 

i dont know what was up but the meat tast like it had been soak in clorox or someth of the sort

given that this place is open till 3am everi night parthenon certain cater to peopl that have been out drink all night those who consequ dont notic the fact that what theyr eat tast like bleach super eww

nev againcongratul state street brat you nail it and by it i mean be just aw last night some friend and i went to brat after not be abl to acquir hockey ticket we want a semiridicul sportscentr atmospher so brat seem like the logic choic wed all been in colleg and thought we knew what to expect nope

aft grab a booth upstair and sit around for awhil a waitress came by and ask if we were interest in order after tell her yes she told us that they were cut their wait staff so we had to go to the bar to order not a huge deal but there were some flaws
1 the wait staff that was suppos cut were aimless wander around the bar for the entir time we were there
2 when you order they told you to just come back and check if your food was readi  no estim of time no notif system and again no use of their employe mill about
3 after our tabl had order and check for food a few time the tabl behind us got waiter service
thank for your outstand custom servic guys

to top it off the food was as lack as the servic the nacho were basic a pile of oil the chees curd eerili resembl bad bread chicken use at fast food chines restaur and the burger basket were a ripoff while the burger was okay the 2 upcharg for fri was a joke for 250 you can get an entir basket of fri but the two buck they charg to add them to your burger onli get you about fifteen soggi fri while the portion size was okay i ate about two befor decid they were too gross to continu on with it nonsens that they charg you so much for a tenth of what come in a basket that you could just order separ for virtual the same price 

at the veri least i learn a veri import lesson state street brat is best enjoy by high intox colleg student and my time there is overlet me prefac this by say that im not a food snob but i do enjoy cook and when i eat out i like to order food that offer me someth that i can not easili creat myself  we are new to madison and just the week befor we ate at tutto down the street from portabella for the first time  tutto is almost exact the same pricepoint and we had good food a great atmospher and a wonder time

when i took my wife famili to portabella for her birthday i was expect someth special  the restaur had equal good review for food and absolut rave review for atmospher  when we arriv we were prompt usher into that room that is typic set asid for famili with children or the underdress  no problem there a littl tacki but the servic was still attent and we didnt want to ruin anyon els romance

in short we were still prepar to be impress  we were veri surpris to discov that the food was absolut lousi  not just bad cheap cater wed banquet bad 

to give you an idea of what i mean the chicken breast in the chicken rollatini was not proper dress and still had bit of gristl attach  it also had that peculiar soft textur that come from sit in a steami warmer for hour befor be use  the procuitto in the rollatini was actual slice smoke ham  the walnut pesto was so oili that it began to separ on the plate and the red potato were a soggi pile of pepper potatoand oil  the entir plate was an overcook tasteless and oili mess

if the rollatini was an embarass the lasagna was simpli careless  it composit was sloppi  the noodl all two of them were so liquid heavi that they did not hold their textur  the sauc was thin and ran out of the lasagn onto the plate which made the entir dish someth like a chunki soup  the entir thing was a sloppi mess  a person annoy that doesnt necessarili indic poor craftsmanship was that there were chunk of meat the size of my thumbs

our other food was similar flaw but it was the sangria that ruin the even  my wife love sangria  she love it enough that she isnt particular picki about it  i can total understand use cheap wine and tripl sec instead of a premium orang liqueur for the drink  i can even understand ad a littl juic to thin it out if it too strong  what i cannot understand is ad water to dilut it  typic if my sangria tast a wateri i assum that it icemelt but this was a degre of wateri that i have onli tast befor when i went back to a glass sit in the hot sun that wasnt worth drink anymor our sangria was liter 13 water

thi is one restaur that has either confus it cater busi with it sit down servic has gotten sloppi or think that it ambianc is sterl enough to make up for lousi food  whatev is the case i cant imagin ever order food there againi need to prefac this by say that the compani was awesome
i love ya kristen if your read this i do 
and it was a blast get to celebr your birthday with you 

but other than that 

this place is rrrrrrrrrrrough 

1 a young server who couldnt make strong menu recommendations
2 a negroni that look like a shirley templ and tast like noth i want to drink
3 the most flavorless flavuhless chicken parmesan i think ive ever eaten 
4 this weird noodl the name of which i cant rememb that theyr suppos to be known for but i cant forget soon enough over cook meali melt in your mouth like you dont want your pasta to do 
5 and honest overpr for the qualiti and portion size 

this place remind me of caruso in tucson httpwwwyelpcombizcarusostucsonhrid6nmdn4voj43v98n5if3pq also italian also an institut and mayb good back in the day 

sometim when thing get older they age grace and other time they suck harder than a six yearold on a jolli rancher 

i know these one star review are hard for folk to digest but so is porta bella when i think about my scale for go as low as ive done so here i think is there ani redeem qualiti that would make it so i would return 

methink noti wish they had negat star becaus that what they deserve
worst place i have ever been to
i came with my 7 year old son to celebr my birthday my son fell asleep so they kick us out

that said let get to business
michael is madison local independ custard joint  it been around sinc the 1980s and has a solid histori in the monro street neighborhood where this locat is locat  as far as frozen custard goe michael is pretti good but it just not what it onc was  even i have to admit that rapid expand yet wisconsin base culver offer better custard today  ive return to madison from los angel for a coupl week everi summer for about 10 year and michael has gradual lost a lot of it appeal

th custard  it not as creami as it onc was but the real problem is that the flavor are lose creativ and fail to come togeth as they onc did  case in point my wife mint chip had no chip tonight while anoth patron was overflow with chocol chip  the qualiti control is not there  the textur is lack the creami so import in good custard  and the flavor rare have fresh berri  a sign that the custard is just not made fresh like it onc was  

the employe were onc local teenag usual west high student or edgewood high student that look like they were have fun and engag the custom  today employe are disengag and give you the impress theyr just go through the motion  they do the jobbut that it  

the store itself is reason clean but it the detail that count  the fluoresc light are cover in bug and spider web the park lot is deterior and the store basic need some invest bathroom light landscap etc

thi take me to my final point the music  it drive my total crazi  whi is a frozen custard stand in madison wisconsin that is cover in kitschi 1950sesqu décor blare club music everi time i go there this has been a constant for sever year now  if the custard was perfect and the custom servic impecc fine ill live with it  but michael is a restaur that has disengag ownership and function as a conveyor belt of cash to the owner pocket  it the worst kind of independ retail retail that doesnt care about custom becaus theyll keep come back  in the end it sad to admit as a proud madisonian that my milwauke friend are correct  kopp is better  oh how i miss what you onc were michael frozen custardthis use to be my goto place anytim i was meet friend for a casual dinner  the pizza is veri good with an excel select of top  howev i will never repeat never step foot in this establish again and here is my stori   bad servic and rude management

i was meet two girlfriend there  when i got there the manag advis she would not seat me until my entir parti arriv which was kind of rude but understand  they fill up fast and the seat is veri limit  when we all arriv we were seat  the first interact we had with our waitress came was a snide comment from her i thought there were go to be four of you impli we had no right to be seat if our entir parti was not there

when the waitress took our drink order my friend order a lemonad  this waitress pipe up the lemonad is homemad and is veri tart  do you still want it  she say with a sigh of impati  my friend say yes  the waitress come back about 3 minut later explain that they are out of lemonad would she like someth els  my friend explain that she could not drink anyth with carbon and did the waitress have anoth suggest  she did not and my friend stuck with water  after our food arriv my friend then ask if they have ice tea as an option  the waitress with the same amount of snide say i think so  we brew it fresh and it sometim run out  also it is veri minti  do you still want it  my friend say yes  and now im start to wonder what is with our waitress  everi time we ask for someth she act like we are inconvenienc her and whi didnt she recommend the ice tea when my friend ask her for noncarbon drink options

twenti minut later our appet of garlic chees bread came and it was good  anoth 15 minut after that our pizza came  complet wrong  i had order a 16 pizza with all mushroom all black oliv half sausag and half pepperoni  the pizza came out with all the meat on one half which is not what i order  i indic to the waitress that this was wrong and she then proceed to flip back through her order pad and with anoth heavi sigh start read my order back  i stop her and told her that i knew what i order and this wasnt it  she offer to have the kitchen make anoth pizza but it would be awhil as there are other pizza ahead of this  i could just feel her beg us to just deal with it and not make her go back for a new pizza  one of my friend had been visit a friend in the hospit and was go to return to her as soon as were done with dinner so we didnt want to wait for a new pizza and just tri to pick around the stuff  as it turn out onli 12 the pizza got eaten as it was just too difficult to deal with  

we never saw our waitress again  anoth 20 minut pass and then the manag sneak the bill onto our tabl and walk away  i stop her to explain that our pizza was wrong and i felt it would be a nice gestur for them to give us a reduct on our bill  the manag stop me abrupt and indic that she had heard about the mixup and felt that her experienc waitress could not have been wrong  what excus me  i then told her our side of the stori which she was clear not interest in hear and then state that sometim we do offer a discount but would not in this case  when i explain i was not some street person tri to get a free meal just a discount to show their concess she didnt care and walk away  

if i am go out to dinner to pay five time what it would cost me to make the same meal at home i expect that some of that money is for custom servic and the luxuri of be wait upon  i couldnt believ this complet disregard for their custom  they didnt seem to care if i would ever return  well now they have not onli lost an exist custom but i will do everyth in my power to ensur that i have some impact on whether they get ani new custom  

i guess the onli way to make my voic heard is by write about it here  i felt sick to my stomach when i left there as if i had actual been rob at gunpoint  for a place that reli sole on repeat custom and word of mouth they have a veri high and mighti attitud  pleas avoid the greenbush at all cost  if you want a uniqu and casual pizza place with creativ pizza and italian food visit villa dolc in middleton  you will have an excel dine experi without the attitud and park hassljust left the greenbushbar in madison our group of 7poc  1 wait a half hour for a tabl then a group who came in after us got seat first

th manag when confront said she decid wed be more comfort near the ac and that whi she gave our tabl away she didnt ask us she didnt stop and inform us we onli were awar when she was ask about the tabl that had been given away

i did not see ani poc in there dure this entir durat as we were leav the manag came out and was like oh we have a love tabl for you but it was pretti fuck too late for that bullshit so we went to qdoba instead

so you might not want to patron this place if your in town for wiscon or everi went in to buy 50 gift certif but the guy sell it to me did not want to take my credit card that they have to pay 3 on the transact so he turn down 50 wow busi must be goodive drop a lot of coin at steve  and i mean  a lot  ive bought a ton of extrem highend whiskey bourbon scotch and tequila along with enough microbreweri beer to compet with a bustl tavern

rec purchas have includ pappi van winkl 23 midleton veri rare glenmorangi oban 18 buffalo trace and 1942  just to give you an idea ive purchas from steve 4 time in the past 8 day  

the servic has never been warm and fuzzi  despit know a fair amount about various liquor and wine im no expert the staff at steve is semihelp and semirud  id expect a gruff interact if i were buy swill from a campus liquor store but not from a place like steve on the corner of junction and miner point

despit the less than consist and less than friend servic i like steve and i wouldv rate them at a solid 4star  until last night

a small group of three adult each of us 40 were in the area at about 845pm and decid to grab 2 bottl of wine and some soda  we race over to steve and were reliev to find it was still open  as we approach the door an employe stern told us you liter have less than 1 minut to buy your sht and get the fck out of here

w said pinot grigio and pinot noir  he didnt answer  so two of us dash for the wine i made a bline to the soda area  

there were 6 custom in the store each was in line with their item we were first up in line  the two bottl of wine were rungup by the same dude who greet us at the door with obscen  

i approach with my soda and the same employe turn to his cowork and said fck this  were done  were not do this sht now  dont sell a fcking thing to ani of these peopl  im not fcking do this  not tonight  everyon out  everyon out  now

i look at him with my soda in hand and said not even a soda  and he said get the fck out of here

wow  i wish i was embellish or exagger  

i was shock as were the other folk we set our thing down and file out  the guy then slampul the door shut as we left

i vow that i will never buy anoth item from steve ever again  im glad to know that this locat is be closedannex soon and i can onli hope that the coloss douch bag who was work there that even land his next job scrub portapotti at the counti chili festival

i fulli realiz that we were there danger close to 900pm that our bad and it total on us  but whi even let us in  whi not say hey sorri folk  were at 900pm  youll have to see us anoth day

instead he let us in swore at us and then made a scene in front of everyon in the store the other custom were older folk as well  a greyhair gentleman with a 12pack of miller lite and a coupl that had a bottl of what appear to be wine  that unprofession in ani arena

so adio steve  i wish i could return the stuff i bought from you earlier this week  id expect crappi servic from the drone at woodman liquor store but never from steve  believ me when i say that im done and that im still shock some 20 hour lateri was so pump to check this place out after i found it by complet accid i read up on it and was realli intrigu by the histori behind the place and how this might be one of the oldest restaur in phoenix they must be do someth right yeah as well as be the onli thing stand from the citi histor chinatown but serious this place did not live up to anyth to ani of my expectations

now i know some might argu that this place serv american chines cuisin and that true howev this is some of the nastiest chines food ive ever had some might complain about the decor but i actual kinda like it i felt like i was in a jarmusch movi so ill give the place some point for that as much as im into dive this is a littl bit higher than a place i ate call won kok which i am convinc is the butthol of los angel chinatown to be honest all i that had at sing high was the chow mein and the wonton soup the wonton soup was just old cabbag boil in water and the chow mein was just a plate of oili noodl needless to say i felt like i was give birth to the antichrist a few hour later

go to sing high for the experi of say you were there but keep your mouth close at all costmy florist cafe is misunderstood  by near everyon live in phoenix you get use to how thing are if you own a food spot it either a coffe shop a bar or restaur much like the clear zone line between residenti and commerci phoenix food spot are either this or that and rare allow to be anyth els  it would be too confusing


so while the complaint about my florist cover a varieti of subject from the lousi menu the lousi food and the lousi servic it onli compound by the fact that when you enter my florist your expect to enter an actual restaur someplac you can get hot food drink and listen to jazz music while sit there pretend your in a complet differ citi one that more metropolitan one that more urban and cool one that doesnt shut down at 10 oclock

mi florist cafe fail consist and miser odd year of bad servic bad food and surpris bore bread havent stop peopl from give this place a chanc over and over again

sur they have one of the best jazz pianist in all of phoenix at least that you can find easili without have to be in ani sort of music circl but is that realli enough with the server dress up disappear regular and deliv plate full of hard near uned bread while have no knowledg at all about ani of the wine theyr suggest whi do peopl continu to frequent this place

i think our expect are too high take away the bad servic dont expect too much out of the food disregard ani of the server suggest regard wine and what do you have probabl one of the more uniqu atmospher you can find in phoenix for the price and the locat there realli isnt anyth like the ambianc youll get at my florist cafe

with an upscal decor enough tabl to comfort fit a small group the jazz piano in the background and the hum of covers fill the room i would dare say that there isnt anyth like this anywher els in phoenix sure there are differ place to go such as chez nous but compar the two would be wrong where chez nous is a great dark soul rb loung my florist is excel open and bright

howev in the end my florist cafe has spent year and year unchang you can onli say a restaur could be so much more for so long after a while you decid to give up on it you decid that it realli wont chang you decid that for some unknown reason the server are differ everi week and so are their manag  but at least the woman play piano can general be count on

mi advic tri my florist onc a year dont order ani food and definit dont order ani bread bring some friend order a bottl of wine of your own choos not the server suggest and have a great time in one of phoenix few uniqu cafeim pretti sure ive figur the conundrum of my florist out becaus it is noth if not a challeng to logic reason everywher 
 
see if you agree

peopl who rave about it  becaus you know theyr out there weve all heard them  live in place like scottsdal or temp or gilbert or mesa or peoria or chandler and theyr woman of a certain age demograph and they wear floral print and drive a lexus and have abov averag but spiritu empti occup they have a coupl of kid who excel in school and play sport for these wonder women who i dont understand on ani level it home it a place to go and eat the food theyr suppos to be eat and drink the ice tea theyr suppos to be drink and talk about their live and enjoy each other 

one recommend i hate hate hate valet park i hate it so much onc they broke my convert top and addit couldnt figur out how to drive my prius i wont turn over my key to them i park across the street i do what i have to do get rid of it die die die 

so anyway the food is blander than bland the server are friend enough but it alway been slow in my experi i just dont get it other than it fit exact one demograph and they drag the rest of us there im sorri if ive offend you with this analysi but if the shoe fitwhi beat around the bush this place suck you can tell that someon just bought the build and thought yeah old florist shop turn overpr restaur oh this is awesom just becaus youv got an antiqu sign with flash light doe not mean qualiti and in this case it certain doe not mean atmospher everyth is overpr and ridicul underwhelm what were they thinking

what they were thinking

 im gonna open up this realli cool restaur that use to be a flower shop now what are we go to do about food
 well my son know how to make stuff
 really
 yeah hes four
 what can he make
 well hes realli good at roll these snake out of playdoh i dont know if
 stop drill youv hit oil were buy tabl a mega piano and we are make this happen

just stay away from this place unless you plan on be adventur and move your wine circleoprah book club meet outsid of scottsdal for a changokay i feel bad bc i see a lot of great review for this place but honest i had the worst experi ever here so im give this  a straight up 1 star  

let me make a few thing clear befor i get start 

1 i arriv befor the lunch rushway befor the lunch rush i was like the 1st person in the restaurant
2 i was meet friend there for a brunchnetwork thing it was four of us all together
3 the bad experi start after i tip as most bad experi do

th food was okay i had an omelet which was decent but it hard to beat fez egg white omelet in my heart but the omelet was okay the atmospher and decor was amaz the servic was exact what you expect as a customer

then right when i put in my mental todo list to give this place 4 to 5 star on yelp the waiter come and tell us after we tip that the tabl we had was for someon special who by the way didnt have a reserv and we had to leav wtf 

how do you tell pay custom and good tipper that they need to leav befor the ink even dri on the receipt  we were pretti upset and ask to speak to the manag who wasnt present but the act manag basic gave us the boot as well 

first time ever i was ask to leav a restaurbluf
got it to go and glad i did the chicken was ok but onli for the first coupl of bite  the red velvet cake was awe 

background
yelp let me down on this one  i order the three piec chicken meal expect to stuff myself content with fri good and slip into a glycosid stupor from a crimin size slab of red velvet cake  let me say i didnt have to watch the scale worri of well earn weight gain from this meal  

the chicken was an initi hit but was short live  i didnt finish it nor did i want to  the waffl did not travel well either it was soggi by arriv 10 min to the hotel  arrgh  nor was it flavor in ani manor i would liken it to the generic bread slice use at other joint for sop up the greas  the red velvet was a crime  it too lack flavor was heavi beyond understand and it hurt me to say this  was onli deserv of the trash wa wa waaaa

20 for soul food that was so baddont let the rate fool you the food is great i have onli eaten at the scottsdal locat but my comment is for the central location
mi mom and i went in there this even after have lunch at the scottsdal locat we stop in becaus the scottsdal locat had run out of banana pud and i was crave it i call ahead to make sure the central locat had not run out as well i told the hostess on the phone that i was head in to get some to go upon arriv we walk in and advis the hostess that we wish to place a dessert order to go she prompt repli that they are not do ani to go order huh i advis the hostess that my mom and i onli want banana pud and a slice of red velvet cake plus had call just 10 minut prior again she remind me that they had been advis by manag that there would be no to go order becaus they back up the kitchen and delay order even for dessert that take 2 minut it would seem to me that if you do not have enough staff to fulli run your busi then you should probabl look into hire anoth cook but i must have mistaken the establish for a restaur silli me after check with manag the hostess return and reluct took my order i ask my mom if she want the red velvet cake or the soc it to me cake the hostess interrupt to advis me that they didnt have that there i remind her that the sign outsid state that it was one of the special today 
it took longer for the hostess to take my money and give receipt than it took to get my order packag to go

i love lolo my famili and i eat at the scottsdal locat 3 time a month we get the best servic there i have been to the locat on central twice and twice they have fail to provid ani servic even close to the servic in scottsdal i am uncertain if it is the locat and blatant disregard for custom or a manag issu either way i will not be return to the central locat i live in central phoenix and would still rather drive to scottsdal where my money and patronag are apprecii will never go again i went with a larg crew intown for bike week i first brought them to this place a few yrs ago befor they rebuilt the new place downtown the owner was nice and humbl appreci all 30 plus peopl that came in each yr they now come into town they all stop in and eat 

this yr they rebuilt and everi singl staff member act too good or busi includ the owner i order a salad  how hard is a salad with chicken never came the owner was veri rude and did not care i will never go again 

one thing peopl shouldnt do is forget who you are where you came from and who got you there black peopl  sorri not about racebut black peopl have been support lolo and religi go from jump all the sudden you get alil chang in pocketand chang   you are never too far up to fall down 

fail 

ps this review is late and onli now thought to do it as i want some lolo todayand recal the rude and saidno gothree strike your out portlands

an employe threw his dirti apron onli a few feet from my plate as i sat at the bar i should have never came back

th 2nd visit i arriv at 930 and was told they were close soon and couldnst seat me as i go back into my car i saw two get seated

i call and complain i was given a comp for two and went for lunch the fish we order was still frozen inside

i will never step foot in portland again unless i have to pee dure first friday      weekend brunch buffet  o      


they have brunch buffet here on saturday  sunday so i stop in this morn to give it a tri  the first anomali were that this is a regular restaur yet they had me pay first  then hand me a plastic picnic plate tini plastic knife  fork  a tini throwaway plastic water cup

i place the brand new magazin i had brought to read on my tabl but when i went to get some chip  salsa under the limit one bowl of chip sign the unfriend server threw my magazin away  then toss a bunch of greasi garbag on top of it

meanwhil back over at the tabl my one bowl of chip  salsa from an unmark select of salsa sat while i went for food with my picnic plate from the 14 tray of hot food minus one that had run out  was not refil until near the end of my visit  the two pair of tong to get bacon or sausag were both too hot to touch  i would have just use the tong from the pancak but there werent ani  everyon had to just use their hand to take a lukewarm pancake

in the other tray were some salti refri bean greasi corn tortilla greasi hashbrown  a few other notverygood thing  i did go wait in line at the regist again though to beg for anoth plastic picnic plate to get a littl more becaus i was still hungri  meanwhil the unfriend server clear my tabl again  i had to beg her for some more tini plastic picnic utensil to eat with

on top of all this it cost a high 975 plus tax without a drink  we have much better choicnever again 

the fish here is as cheap as you can get prefabr fish squar that are slight better than mcdonald filetofish the shrimp that i order were flat like pound out flat who know what this crap was the fri  were limp and flavorless the onli thing that made this ani better was the special sauc which i believ to be hot sauc  ketchup

thi place is super cheap and the food reflect whi there is no reason i will ever eat here again peac out pete im a huge fan of most berto type joint i occasion enjoy have lard drip down my chin after bite into a question beef taco       not here 

the oil veri obvious hadnt been replac in who know how long it was pure sick i am not a picki eater by ani stretch grow up with littl  has it perk in that way someth has to have zero redeem qualiti for me to not just eat it anyway

i usual love fish taco at place like this but these were fuck aw not crispi sauc tast like straight mayo taco from hade      blech
i wont return im take a long break from ani berto as well after this experi my heart and cholesterol level thank you eribertosad  we had a horribl experi there tonight

let me start with some background  i am a phoenix nativ and have been to mari coyl more time than i can count  my sister work there mani moon ago and i live mere block away from the store   i desper want this to be a success ventur for the new owner and most of all i want a great goto spot for my husband and my kid grandpar aunt uncl etc i have a fantasi that this place turn into a great joint to bring client for lunch and a solid place for food and ice cream

tonight i went with kid  me and three kid to celebr my daughter birthday  what could be better  i wasnt look forward to the dinner menu but i was hope that the new ownership had improv the mediocr food and the time we spent have dinner would pass without incid to get us to the main event  ice cream

110 minut after we arriv we got up and went to the regist where our server and the manger were station  no one had come to our tabl to ask how our food was to refil our beverag to clear our tabl to take our ice cream order or to even walk past  my kid went to the ice cream dure this time and got sampl of the flavor and had decid what they want to order  we wait and wait and wait  i call out a polit excus me to no avail as our server walk by  final from our booth i call a nearbi ice cream shop to see if they had a wait  i was told they didnt and i gather my kid and went to the regist to leav  i said to my server  you never came back to my tabl you never came back  we sat and sat and you never came to our tabl she said to me  your total is 21  that was it  that was my even out to celebr my daughter august birthday at my neighborhood joint with her brother and her best friend  im stun  i want this to be a great place but i would settl for a good place  i hope that one day it is that place but it will take some time for the bad tast in my mouth to go awaybland bore mexicanesqu food 

warn sign 1 all white peopl dine there
warn sign 2 salsa that bland as ketchup
warn sign 3 no hot sauc on the table

th three of us each had a differ item from the lunch special yet our plate look almost indistinguish from one anoth on each was some configur of flour tortilla mountain of shred iceberg lettuc and a slick of pale refri bean all top with  orang cheese

you can get more flavor mexican food at del taco this place is more like mexic food ulgh i want my 525 backwe have never had a togo order that has been correct from here ever

number two horribl enviorn ugli pink wall with horribl dollar store decor the booth seat were waaaayyy to close to the tabl which made for an uncomfort sit experi the sneez guard were dirti weird smell and stupid layout with a coupl of booth too close to the employe person area and some too close to the again small buffet line

issuesconcern 
1 dinner parti was seat 20minut befor ani water or bread was brought out first came the water then 20minut later the bread then 20mintu later the drink order then 20mintu later the meal order then 20minut later the appet and so on im okay with a leisur dine pace but this was ridicul 

2 initi onli one waitstaff was assign to our group of 20 until we complain to someon from that point on we had 15 waitstaff assign i dont fault the waitstaff they appear to be do their best 

3 we were veri lucki to get the separ dine area so had a lot of privaci after the one other occupi tabl depart for the entir durat of our stay over 2hour that dirti tabl remain load with dirti dish and uneaten food even though the restaur was relat slow 

4 we never did see the shiftmanag one would think that with a parti of 20 a 400 dinnertab on an otherwis slow sunday afternoon with a guarante 18 gratuiti includ in the bill that had been prebook for 23 week in advanc that the manag would exert a littl extra effort to make sure our parti was taken care of to make it a memor event given it was such a special occas for our parent 

5 brotherinlaw request the waitstaff to bring one bottl of red and one bottl of white wine for each of the two tabl upon initi entri 30minut later after he ask again it was brought out and set on end of the tabl with no offer to pour or serv when we rangout we were surpris to see the normal housewin charg at 30 per bottleseem veri high for hous wine 

6 we were all instruct to use the crayon and circl our menu choic on the menu sheet like we were in 1st grade veri classynot 

7 appet were general tasti but portion seem small

 i could go on but you get the point 

in my opinion there are too mani other dine choic in the phoenixarea to wast ani more of my time or money at ramono macaroni grill again this make me sad becaus i had some great dine experi there when they first open in my opinion the fishstinksfromtheheaddownthi is a manag issu that need to be fix by corpori was on my way to port of sub but it was crazi pack and i hate crowd so i kept drive and found this place thought id give it a tri oop my bad the kid was nice behind the counter when i ask what was good i order what he suggest a 6 inch italian type club for my meat eat brother and a what seem harmless enough a stuf tomato w egg salad for myself along w drink chip and a cooki for the kid to go it was 17 he even gave me a box to carri the drink safe 

i get to my bros and we sit down to eat i open my box and it was ahem a layer of lettuc on the bottom with a total unrip light pink tomato cut into wedg w the egg salad pour on top ummmm it was bad folk i couldnt even bare to take a pictur there was noth good about this or worth the 6 it cost my bro is like mikey he will eat anyth well he ate the sandwich but it was drench with ranch wtf i dont rememb ask for ranch it also had the same pink tomato in it honest not sure how this place stay open when even subway would be better this place get 2 thumb down mayb breakfast would be betterafter wait a long time which is expect on a weekend we get walk to our tabl and ask the unnecessari question is this your first time here when is the last time you were here blah blah blah we get sat in the waitress section and she take about 10 minut to get our drink order mind you she onli had 3 tablesinclud our well it turn out she knew the peopl at one of the tabl becaus she spent a lot of time talk to them by the time our food got to the tabl our drink were empti she left them empti she ask if we need someth els we told her what we need she was gone for at least 10 minut and came back with noth my husband had to take all of our empti cup to the bar for a refil my steak was over cook but that wasnt my biggest complaint it was anna our server she was horribli never thought id be leav a review for a groceri store but last night experi at the deli was so godaw 

i had to pick up a few item for the hous and sudden crave fri chicken rather than go to nasti kfc i decid to pick some up from their deli

th ladi who take your order is rude she was talk to a cowork while i was wait to place my order and didnt stop talk to said cowork until i said excus me  should i come back

then i order the 8 piec for me and the famili with two side the side arent list on the menu so i ask her what the side were she proceed to without even look at me point to the right and said there

th side were terribl the mac n chees was almost gone no mash potato i was left with seafood salad and coleslaw i take everyth home and was so livid when i took the first bite of chicken there was no chicken on the insid how is that even possibl it was just burnt skin 

i would have been better off at kfcok never go back to this place again easter day noth open heard about this place figur it would ok the host that walk us to the tabl and left without a word mayb an enjoy would have been nice he then tell a server i sat you server look at our two top and grunt nice im alreadi so happi to be here it just get wors the food tast aw our server sneez into his hand twice and kept work we ask for side plate and he ask anoth server if there was anoth and she said this is the onli one here and i dont know if it clean talk to the manag after and he said sorri thank for let me know but he never even ask where i was sit never againok  i made a visit albeit still skeptic  i absolut must point out first and foremost that anyon who view this as a good destin for anyth relat to new england or seafood is one of three things

1 owner of the restaurant
2 never had good seafood before
3 never had good seafood before

th clam chowder is a pasti concoct that doe not begin with baconsalt pork has bit of chewi rubberi clam is tasteless and overal would reciev a boost with the addit of a coupl of can of snows

th fri clam were horribl  the onli plus was that they were not strip  they were actual belli clam but i use that term veri loos  price will alway determin the qualiti when it come to clam  they cost a certain amount of money and there is no way to get around thatunless of cours your not use ipswich clam  there is no way that these are from ipswich shellfish co  the batter is terribl as well  whi would anyon choos to fri a clam in anyth but an evapor milkcorn flour dredge

ani new england who has had a good chowder from legal sole etc or a clam from the clam box essex or ronni know that this place is not your fri clam destination

wait  i almost forgot  the tarter sauc was horribl as well  can i give zero starmy grandma love me

thi grandma onli offer me     margarin  

realli  in today day and age and grandma has no butter  it not just about scienc here it about tast  unfortun grandma didnt have that either

th hashbrown were flavorless  the ham was onli cook on one side  the french toast had a form of cinnamon in it but it still lack in flavor explain to me how that is possibl  im still perplex  the mapl syrup was a far distant step cousin to anyth mapl  the coffe a measur in ani restaur was miser lacking

w went to grandma kitchen base on the two review here on yelp and i was sad sad misl  my grandmoth werent this rude and their cook was infinit bettertast  dont wast the trip  i order egg that had absolut no tast to them  the waitress went out of her way to be rude to me and other guest there  

horribl horribl servic i think they are mental ill and veri bad foodi went here with my father in law and my 9 year old daughter i order the chilli and it was serv in a cup and cost me near six dollar along with it came two packag of two cracker i start eat the chilli and it was a littl spici so i ask for more cracker well you would have thought i ask for the goos that laid the golden egg i have never come across a more rude grandma in my life she made all kind of remark and face becaus i ask and then brought me two more cracker she then proceed to tell a stori about a man that use to come in all the time and he was alway dietingsh laugh and laugh becaus even though he diet he was still fat i couldnt believ what i was wit none of us at the tabl were fat either so i have no idea where that stori came from

needless to say we will never patron this establish again there was noth special about the food servic or anyth els and i along with everyon els in the world can live without the meanessi use to go to this restaur long ago
i stop go to this one long ago
that becaus of the follow event
i had taken a larg group of peopl there for a get togeth includ my entir famili  we place our order the waitress got us our drink our food was brought to us in a reason amount of timebut  she brought us no napkin  we were eat bbq you must have napkin with bbq  well we were eat it anyway without them  eventu our drink ran out  me and bbq must have fluid lot of fluid

thi was go on 25 minut without a waitress show up and i final got up and got the napkin  i then start refil the drink at the counter  yup just help myself  dunno what happen to the waitress but this deal was begin to put a damper on the festiv spirit and i was determin to deal with it myself

wel that got that attent of manag who came storm over and demand to know what i was do there  i look at this guy squar in the eye and ask him whi he hadnt been so incred concern about the servic at our tabl  which was nonexist  if he was pay so much damn attent to what i was do at the drink bar which is suppos to be for employees

wher our waitress it been 30 minut now and no sign of her we have been wait for napkin and refil i final decid to get them myself sinc your employe arent go to do it for us  

you wanna know what happen to our waitress  reeeeeeealli her shift was over and she went home  i can laugh about it now i was piss at the time  this woman just up and left us strand  we had just start eat when she had dump the food on our tabl and took off  it not like we had been sit there for half the night and it was time for us to leav  this stupid manag still had tude written all over his face  his apolog was pathet  his offer of a free dessert was even more atroci  give me 50 off the meal and ill be happi  we didnt eat their free dessert everyon at the tabl was equal as appal at this restaur that manag and the waitress  

i foot the bill and we left and i have never gone back to that place

edit here the realli funni part for me i am a realli good tipper when i get great servic  not unusu for me to dole out 25 to 30 tip regardless of how larg the bill is  i was at denni the other day and got such great servic for the kind of place it is i tip 25 for a 11 meal lol  hey you gotta tip em  they arent make ani kind of hour wage what is it 400 per hour  just throw that in there if you are go to go to a restaur and you get good or even okay servic pleas tip that person  without the tip they sink well when your waitress goe home and you get a manag with a pathet attitud what do you tip  yup the ageold penni  if im go to be insult im go to dole it out right back to emi will never go back to this restaur becaus the owner was the biggest dbag you have ever met he was so obnoxi and loud tri to entertain everyon that walk in i dont need a clown show with my dinner i think the music in the restaur is purpos veri low so he can hear himself mispronounc italian word on top of this he gave me a glass of wine that smell and tast more like vinegar and feet i told him veri discreet and polit that my wine doe not tast right he made a big deal out of it there was 3 other tabl there for dinner and he put on a show for them by yell that he just open that bottl and he check it himself the tabl next to us was an older coupl that were his friend and even they join in and made some rude comment i couldnt believ it this is a nightmar i am pay to be insult everyon was stare at me and it was extrem embarrass 
seem that this place has surviv so far becaus the owner wife is the chef and she doe a good job the food was great 
mi advic to her get your dead beat of husband away from your custom hes more suit to clean the toilet then interact with peopl he said the word perfecto a thousand time he is annoy cheesi and rude he doesnt know sht about winemy husband and i live close by and decid to tri alessia when we walk in we were greet by the bartend who said the hostess would be right back we wait a few minut and she never came i was hug my husband and this waiter decid to come up behind me and say hello as if he were go to seat us i immedi let go of my husband onli to find that he was just say hi the hostess still was not there so after a minut the waiter seat us and told us to sit where ever we want so what was the point of wait at all anyways

w brows the menu and note realli seem that appet to me my husband ask the waiter how big the portion are for the fettuccin alfredo the waiter look at my husband like he was an idiot for ask such a question and said  i dont know like averag  doe that make sens my husband was piss but blew it off as to not ruin the even we order the fettuccin alfredo to split which came with a salad the salad was good but the alfredo tast like easi mac i would have sent it back but i didnt want to make my husband feel bad becaus he chose the restaur and i was hungri the alfredo wasnt enough food so we decid to order calamari from our second waiter yes they have multipl waiter as if they are tri to be a five star restaur which they are not even close then our first waiter came back to ask us if we want dessert when we had just order someth i just think it is unorgan and confus to have five differ waiter i felt like no one knew what was go on and that we kept get interrupt 

normal at italian restaur the calamari is fri but not here they set it in front of us and i was horrifi i did not want a nasti rubberi ring tomato soup we sent it back and decid to just forget order anyth els we receiv our bill and notic there was a 4 charg for split the easi mac this place is such a rip off we paid 18 for a two small bowl of easi mac we did not see on the menu that there was a charg for split meal becaus if we had we would have not split a meal i will never in my life come back to this place ever againi came here with a big group on a friday for happi hour  our waitress was aw  it took forev to get a drink and i was onli the third person to arriv and the place was still empty

th food was okay but i wish there was smaller option especi for a happi hour  the drink too were just okay

th real problem was with our bill  for about 12 of us it came out to be 80000  my friend and her mom split a meal  when they brought it out on two plate both of them start eat them  after they were halfway done the waitress inform them that one of those plate was actual for someon els  ok fine but that not my friend fault  they should have either split up the one plate for them or not put two in front of them  she ask the waitress to take it off the bill and my friend was told to get out of her seat and go talk to the manag  what  then the manag told her that sinc she ate it she should have to pay for it  i have never heard someon act so rude as a manag  he should have easili taken the 15 off from our 800 bill  i would never come here againthe peopl who give this dump a posit rate are probabl the same crowd who patron arbi mcdonald rigatoni and the myriad slop shop that abound in a state that has absolut no culinari savvy

th servic is second rate at best with waiter who could not care less about your satisfaction

th foodwel if youv just been releas from dachau or treblinkayou might find it palat warm when it should be hotspic so that all you realli tast is the spice it unimagin uninspir and not italianrepeatnot italian it an approxim of what someon who has never tast real italian food might offer up as authentic

a for the wineswel if you understand what the term terroir mean youll realiz that with all the soil be  the same in their vineyard there can be no real distinct in their purport variet you do know what im talk aboutdont you so if you like your white to have the same under flavor as your red and with scant differ between say a cab and a zinyoul love the previnegar serv up by their socal wine expert of cours youll forev brand yourself as an eater and drinker of the lowest form of comestibles

sotourist and arizonan revel in your culinari ignor and go hang your bib and hit the trough this will leav room at tabl for those of us who have taken the time and spent the money to garner some culinari knowledg god know there are few enough real restaur to go around
unfortun a no star rate is not an option this place is suitabl for the homeless and other unfortun who need a meal at ani cost on the plus side the food is not poison see even i can find some good in almost anyth as well the manag will not respond to ani critic that is not couch in glow term i sent them an email reflect of this review and my brother simultan sent a posit one guess who got answer i told the owner in no uncertain term that he knew just how bad the place is and that it was sheer arrog know that it would probabl not affect his busi as there alway an influx of new and unsuspect touristsmost from the midwestwher culinari savoir fair are just meaningless furrin word on the other hand the nativ of this state who go more than onc present a quandri i had some guy in a cowboy hat still on his head ask me whar hairi cot vert were i had to hide my grin as he was bigand you knd of know how a guy who keep his hat on indoor will react so i smile sweet and explain that they were green bean and veri good for a grow redneck 
ps i have no idea what meant by ask if the photo below are help help for what oh wellstop in today with my boyfriend and our 6 year old  i order the green chili burro chimi style  sour cream and guac on the side  as i cut into my burro it liter deflat  my curios led me to open the chimi where i found 5 cube piec of green chili beef 5 5 quarter size piec of meat in a full size tortilla  i order the burro chimi style caus i like a crispi shell  this was not the case  after finish my 5 with meat bite i ate mushi tortilla with some semi par green chili sauc and onli becaus i hadnt eaten all day and i am pregnant  and for 7 i couldnt throw it away  but i will never buy it again

mi boyfriend and the wee one both had shred beef taco noth terribl pretti decent i would of rather had the taco  he origin want a shred beef burrito san bean  the guy look at him and rather rude repli well we can do it but the burrito wont be big  seem like a pattern here  in addit if your charg me for a steak burrito i dont want a bean burrito with some steak in it i want a steak burrito with some bean in it  if your inform custom that without the filler it wont be much of a burrito it isnt a good sign

they also dont take credit or debit which is a huge pain  it wouldnt be as bad if they had an atm but they dont so we had to order base on the littl cash i had in my wallet  

we got my meatless fake chimi 6 taco and 1 soda for 21  the taco were not that big  skip it  or drive the block or so extra to rositabugger bagel that gross right but that what i call this bruegger on az ave this is go to sound super mean but everyth about this place is gross like gag me with a spoon gross the kitchen isnt clean the tabl are never buss and the bagel are alway a littl crunchi and i cant tell you how mani time ive seen the staff here handl food without gloves

exhal ok i feel bettersorri to disagre with all the gangplank boy but well i strong disagre chuck and i stop at coffe island on our way to gangplank this afternoon and i realli wish i would have just spent 3 minut make sandwich at home and save us the 13 

i had the ham  swiss chuck had the southwest sandwich and i could have easili made the same sandwich at home for a fraction of the cost  the sandwich were good but not amaz our beverag were 2 can of pop diet coke and dr pepper whoa turn out those are both found in my refriger as well and had to pick a chunk of mold off of my bread

next time ill definit choos cook myself over throw money down the drain at coffe island 

although on the upsid the 2 peopl work there were extrem nice bring out extra dill pickl and stir up some convers in the 10 minut it took to make a frickin sandwichi was walk in old town wait for my hair appoint later in the afternoon i was look for the mandala tea room but found the picnic compani first there were about 10 polic motorcycl out front and i figur they knew what was up food wise in the area 

i felt rush from the second i walk in the door the employe look like they were in a hurri and i felt pressur to order fast i quick glanc at the menu not want to get a sandwich i decid on the sedona salad for 650 

the salad was slap down on the pickup counter and when i got up there it was the most unapp thrown togeth mess ive ever seen at ani establish that call itself a restaur first it was extrem small second the spinach feta nut and red onion were all just thrown on there as though it went through some fast food assembl lineth vinaigrett tast bottl i could have made a more present salad that tast better with produc from frys that cost me less than a dollar 

who know how their sandwich are im sure theyr decent consid all the cop in there i wont be back to find out 

i was so hungri after eat this sorri excus for a salad i walk over to the mandala tea room and ate anoth meal ughjulio gs resid at the veri bottom of the barrel when it come to mexican food in the valley from the outsid the bright and vivid color build might make you think that it some tasti independ own hole in the wall but dont fall for the mirag your walk into a dungeon of greasi food and bad servic 

it took about five minut to complet be turn off by this place we sat down and were greet by what had to be one of the most disinterest waitress ive ever had she had this vibe go that made us feel like we were inconvenienc her just by be there her nondescript facial express and attitud were overshadow onli by her terribl servic which could best be describ as go through the motion even that is give her too much credit though open the menu yield even more dissatisfact the menu itself was drab and gimmicki and was full of unflatt pictur of the food make it feel like a chore to even pick out someth that look appet one thing i notic immedi that should have been a red flag was that for all of their chicken dish they charg about three dollar extra for white meat that never a good sign 

we eventu settl on a chorizo breakfast quesadilla and their sampler platter which includ one of just about everyth on the menu the breakfast quesadilla was massiv it mustv weigh about three pound the tast was okay but it was drip with greas and after just a few bite it was hard to stomach ani more of it our other dish the sampler platter could best be describ as a plate of hot garbag the assort of food was thrown on the plate and absolut smother with chees way too much chees in fact the plate itself was liter swim in chees which almost seem to be liquefi more than like just an arteri clog mixtur of melt chees and greas the meal was such a greas bomb that we probabl ate about 20 percent of it yet we felt like our stomach were go to explod when we were done there is that nice full feel you get after you eat a well made meal at a good restaur then there is that feel you get after you eat someth like julio gs that feel can best be describ as where the toilet to wrap up the love meal the waitress mess up the bill and charg us for both of our drink even though one of them should have came free with our breakfast quesadilla at that point though it was a mute point and we didnt have the energi or patienc to tri and explain what had happen to her at risk of caus her brain to short circuit 

this is a place i can firm say i wont be return to under ani circumst julio gs is a poster child for everyth a restaur should not be bland and bore greasi food huge portion but zero qualiti and a wait staff that youd swear just woke up from a long nap to top it all off the price are a tad steep for a mexican restaur so basic there no reason at all to ever tri this place youv been warn blehi bought a groupon for bravo bistro after read other posit review on yelp and elsewher the groupon was 44 which includ a dinner for 2 seem an amaz deal it was suppos to includ ani appet ani 2 glass of wine and ani 2 entre the groupon explicit state that the valu of the deal was 124 up to 16 appet 2x16 wine 2x 38 entree

when i sat down to the tabl and explain that i was use a groupon i was surpris when the hous menu was taken from my grip and replac with a small green piec of paper detail the groupon menu on this menu the most expens entre was 22 and none of the larg 2 person appet were includ my 124 valu groupon now felt like it was worth much less

needless to say we were furious i ask to speak to the manag the manag came over an act veri smug while he explain to me that this was the groupon menu that i had to order from

th manger listen but seam to care littl that the restaur was complet mislead custom with the groupon deal after a 10 minut argument he agre to to accommod us and gave us the normal menu back i then order the veal ossobucco my favorit dish and the reason for us come to bravo bistro in the first place

im then told that they are all out of ossobucco of cours how conveni and they also wouldnt allow us to order ani of the special either

w paid for our two glass of wine left and refund our groupon by email supportgrouponcom

wel never go back

ther are plenti of great restaur in the old town area id recommend stay far away from this place  dont be temp by mislead groupon dealfirst off  i usual reserv use yelp for restaur i realli like and tri to keep thing posit  this is the except  i feel so  violated

i am also a person who went on a groupon  it was given to me from my dad  we went to bravo bistro excit base on the few thing we had read  that what groupon are great for right  to tri new things

th waitress was veri nice in fact the servic was just fine

it was the food  we look over the menu listen to the special  and everyth sound great  we decid to get the chef chees plate as a light appet befor the heavi main cours was due  

i am not sure who chef toni is  but the chees plate was describ simpli as select chees fruit nut cracker 

 fine sound simpl and tasti  now i am think or envis in my head was a few artisan chees  some almond simpl fruit and nice craft cracker  what we got and this pretti much set the stage for continu disappoint was what look like a chees plate one would get from safeway   serious  long slice wedg of pepperjack and american cheddar  with two strawberri cut in half and not a singl nut to be found   the cracker were one varieti of the most generic kind  terribl    

i didnt even realli know what to think  i dont normal send thing back or caus a fuss so i endur through it  this should have serv as a warn  a veri obvious warning

i bold order the cioppino  when it came it look great  when it enter my mouth it  didnt tast like anyth  total bland  edibl but bland  i dont normal ask how much the special is when the waitress is done describ them   i think it is tacki  but this time it might have been a good idea  i paid 36 for the worst cioppino i have ever had

needless to say we skip desert  i guess we learn our lesson

tot bill for total sht and 3 glass of chianti  98  yep that is 2 entré a total crappi chees plate and 3 hous chianti  98  i was absolut floor and furious  

this place suck do not go there 

i dont even feel better after write thisfood still tast like doo doo

and the servic is still on par with the food

caveat emptorold town tortilla factori patio and outdoor ambianc is beauti romant on a perfect arizona even in the spring or fall it an excel spot to enjoy the comfort climat one star award 

but if you do anyth besid sit on the patio you will be disappoint four star deduct   

our server took our order after we had been seat for about 1015 minut then it was like she complet forgot that she had to actual bring us our margarita and food total space cadet we ask for thing like water that never came 

call me crazi as most peopl do but i was also high irrit by the fact that the chip and salsa here are not complimentari that someth i expect from a mexican dine destin for the top shelf price they could at least throw in a measli chip and salsa bowl on the hous yeah their tortilla with cube of butter are suppos to replac the chip and salsa but tortilla and butter methink not methink that id much rather have chip and salsa

th food is mild to bland yet it cost a pretti peso i order the el tesoro del mar  a salad consist of most iceberg lettuc ick spici honey chipotl dress waaaaay too sugari with too littl spice pico de gallo corn black bean tortilla strip and larg gulf shrimp onli 4 shrimp and they were hard larg more like small to medium size this disappoint of a dish cost about 15 overr i can honest say ive had a much tastier shrimp salad at baja fresh for half the price and doubl the shrimp nonetheless 

i tire some of the enchilada that matt order and they tast forgett at best ive had better enchilada sauc from a store bought can and then my mother who was in town visit for the weekend order the grill salmon she was so unimpress by the meal that she didnt even finish it and she alway finish her food it take a lot of skill to mess up someth like a grill salmon 

as far as their margarita go they are good but with the 850 to 11 price tag im just not convinc that they are worth it ive had better margarita at place with better menus i can honest say that after eat here onc i have zero desir to ever go backyou know how your wife or girlfriend is alway whine about how you never listen to them this of cours as a shoe come whistl past your cranium
wel the tortilla factori must have the same listen skillstheir manag never listen either

you would think that after 111 review someon over there would recogn there a problem with the servic 
nope
thi would lead one to conclud noon in manag know about yelp or and i suspect this is more the case they cant read

prior to write this i read some of those 111 review in an effort to see how my experi last night pairedup
uncannili it was true to form explain whi this place get two and a half stars

servic was bad with waiter onli stop by to sell more drinks
had to ask for the tortilla twice befor ever see themappx 20 minut wait on the free tortillas
hey tf do i need to remind you of your namesake

and the price for the amaz tasteless food will stupefi you i sampl everyon food in our parti of eight 

old town tortilla factoryyour realli one sneaki bastard
lay in waitfor all the unsuspect scottsdal visitor look for the mexican food experi and instead ambush them with your bad servic high price and tasteless garbag you call food

but you do have some nice attribut which is whi similar to my situat of never listen i still have a wife
on im not sure how a fountain larg patio and a cutesi margarita cup are go to keep you in business
oh well who caresright
therel be anoth plane full of visitor head your way tomorrow 

are you relat to rustler roost by ani chanc 
you both have so much in commonthis place should now be call old town tourist trap 

brought outoftown famili seven of us here for what we thought was go to be a nice dinner out on the patio ha

her a summari of the even a wednesday night no less the crowd was most spring train basebal fan and it was fair busi we had a 7 pm reserv tabl readi when we arriv this is the onli star they get

th margarita were water down  basic glorifi juic box and this place is suppos to be famous for their margarita 

dine area too mani tabl cram togeth includ a waitstat extra plate silverwar clean rag napkin pitcher of tea and etc in the middl of the dine area nasti and to top it off way too mani backwat and clean staff  cant tell you how mani time they bump into our chair walk by with their bucket of dirti dish manag need to streamlin and reduc the number of employe on the floor bathroom a mess  water all over the floor and trash overflowing

decor and ambianc christma light wrap around a dead tree that should have been remov year ago and replac with a live tree leftov over christma ornament are still left on the other tree realli in late march tabl cover with vinyl sticki brown vinyl wait staff attir and look is sloppi and dishevel 

we order appet  noth special tortilla came with butter that was practic frozen nephew practic ate a whole basket of tortilla chip whi becaus we wait for an hour we watch four tabl come after us and finish their dinner  two had alreadi left for our dinner to come 

our waitress samantha was practic nonexist and spent the better part of the even hit on the three guy at the next tabl  she should have spent the time yell at the cook to get our dinner out and send the manag to us to apolog side note the tabl next to us the three guy got their dinner within 15 minut of sit down their food arriv right after our did

aft an hour the food arriv  mine and my nephew enchilada were luke warm i want to walk out at that point but partner did not want to make a scene in front of the kids

not onc did samantha apolog for the el crappo servic nor did she bring the manag over to apolog and mayb comp the dinner or drinks

bottom line wont be come here again and i high recommend both the local and tourist to avoid this placelove restaur but below averag food i was surpris they didnt offer offer one vegetarian entre on the menu as most restaur now do  tortilla were cold and tough to chew the taco meat entre that came with rice and bean includ that i request a vegetarian substitut did not come with rice which is beyond me in term of reason  i had even ask when i was order to make sure rice was includ  fiancé had the carn de fuego which did not have ani side or tortilla with it which we would have expect below averag servic took 10 minut of wait after we were done befor ani one notic to take our plate away  it a damn shame we had such a bad experi as it is a nice look properti and we were think of possibl have our rehears dinner here  unfortun we wont be backthis place realli should get 5 star but it doesnt even deserv 1

why

wel for starter unless you go there when it open it pretti dirti with napkin and bit of food on the floor and on the seat no excus for this  second the bathroom are alway disgust  honest i dont know how it pass inspect with the bathroom alone

it is a great locat and the ice cream is pretti damn good noth fanci it old school ice cream and for that it fantast  the nonic cream item burger sandwich etc should be avoid just get the ice cream

fin like other have said the owner not so much the staff are on the rude side  i have seen custom get yell at becaus they ask for their tabl or chair to wipe down  mayb over the year they have becom jade see the countless number of drunk come in here and act like they own the place  i can tell you that when he was yell at the custom abov she was veri polit and it was in the midafternoon i hope that someday this place get bought by someon who love custom and much as mani peopl love this place out of nostalgia for the past sever year this place has lost it sparkl and i realli would like to see it return to it former glorifunni thing when you perus all of yelp non recommend review for this place  most of them are pretti bad and all say the same thing 
lousi servic check
in attent rudeuncar staff check again
dirti menus and establish ewwww
sub par ice cream and food yup
a sens of disarray and no organ saw it
i think the onli thing this establish has go for it it kitchi pink decor histori in old town and the long ago review of the way thing use to beappar you can onli ride that for so long this place is just aw now too bad bill keen would be disappointed
even the owner himself was unfriend shameyuck and i mean that will all gusto behind the word i absolut did not like this place it veri rare that i dislik a place this much i usual can find someth redeem like los olivo doe have some pretti damn good salsa but i could not see myself go here ever ever again unless my famili drag me here they of cours love this place 

yum that what my famili said i ask them what i should say in my review my dad love los olivo and said hed rate em 45 star he onli deduct the 12 star becaus they took our chip away befor we were finish with them i guess it was a barter system your entre for our chip 

perhap i order the wrong thing after all i didnt want to drown in greas so i pick the shrimp entre that came with rice i pick at the soggi rice i nibbl on the burnt garlic toast and the shrimp well let just say i wasnt expect to have to work for my food i had to peel the shell off myself how do i do that i ask horrifi still a shrimp novic i had no clue you grab their littl leg and pull i near had to excus myself to go throw upthank you for ruin my saturday afternoon

it been 15 hour sinc i ate here and i am just now start to feel normal again  ive been eat tum and chase them with soda to settl my stomach as well as make sever bathroom trip  i have never been this sick from eat anywher  i think taco bell would have been far superior and they dont even serv real meat
    
the chip and salsa were okay  my bf and i split the chees crisp with beef first mistak  the beef look grey  and the chees look old and overcook my entre was the chicken burrito  i think they use chicken in a can bc the meat was so dri and shred  the waitress offer a sauc on top and good thing i accept bc otherwis i would have had to choke down the dri burro  

gordon ramsey need to take over and revamp this place  the locat is prime but it seem like they were just be lazi all around  i think they need to pare down the menu becaus there are too mani choic and most of it is the same crap just reword  also i kept see so mani server stand around shoot the shit  if you dont have ani tabl you could be help out in other way     this place realli lack warmth from the staff and i think it import to make your custom feel welcom 

i realli dont see myself come here ever again unless they make huge changthis is a tough review to write  the locat was great and im sure the dinner wouldv been good too base on the other reviews
unfortun my team didnt like anyth on the preset menu and the restaur didnt want to work with them on find altern  
i was a restaur manag so yeah i get it  the food has alreadi been purchas and prep etc  but there were onli 8 of us how hard is it to be flexibl  how hard is it to say yes of cours but we will have to charg you separ  when a group that is spend a coupl thousand dollar on dinner tell you theyr go to leav befor you even bring the appet out doesnt that concern you  wouldnt you send a manag over
if your cowboy ciao the answer to all of these is no  what a bummerwhat is up with peopl who like schlotzki deli my famili think it good that when you put their pizza or sandwich in your mouth the experi is enjoy they are wrong it as far from enjoy as i am from tradit and even though they are wrong it all fine and good except for those rare occas when i dont have the choic about whether i am also forc to eat there like birthday i dont want to throw my mom under the bus becaus i cant even fathom what this say about her to the unknow reader but for her last bday she want schlotzski i know i know 

it just so bad what do you like the sandwich that ridicul bread 30000 cucumb slice the pizza is so banal i cant even comprehend everyon like artichok heart but it cant just be that on a veggi pizza you must also includ flavor 

but peopl like it i do not get it on ani level i want to i just dont 

i activ dislik write bad reviewit break my heart to have to write this review of a restaur that use to be one of my favorit place to eat in scottsdal 

today we were have a sunday brunch for my besti who live in texa i had fond memori of the food and especi the sopapilla we arriv at noon it wasnt terribl busi so we sat outsid on the patio 

first off we order margarita and sever other decid on the bloodi mari bar the margarita were gross salti and sour w lime that were long past their prime the bloodi mari drinker were made to waitand waitand wait for their glass to walk insid to make their drink 

we order our entre at about 12301245 and didnt get them until after 130 when i receiv my carn adovada burrito it had been nuke beyond recognit the rice was shrivel and was burnt onto the plate as were the black bean my first bite of the burrito was a hunk of fatthat pretti much end it for me also the sopapilla i order for the dish came out 20 minut later after i remind him the sopapilla was not at all like i rememb and was more of a flatten piec of naan than anyth els  

the rest of my parti had vari issu with their meal to add insult to injuri my lunch cost 55 for one gross burrito 2 drink and a piec of bread pud due to whatev gratuiti they ad the waiter was surlywhen he was present at all which was rare no water refil complet unapologet for the various issu with our experi and never took away the offens margarita he serv in the begin 

needless to say we will not be return what the hell happen to this place ugh bummerthis place is aw i wish i could give it no star i had a terribl experi here and wrote my previous review earlier this week their pr person contact me and ask more about it so i told them they ask if they could pass my inform along to the director of operationsown and i receiv a two page letter degrad me and basic tell me that i am a selfright btch who know noth about custom servic and i onli care about myself 

todd goldman the owner who so kind took the time to teach young girl like me life lesson about custom servic and the restaur industri and point out that i get so mad and take it so person that i fail to think ration while i struggl with the idea that i am not the most import person in the world appar my myopic viewpoint and exagger opinion of myself are stagger whatev he may feel about me i do know one thing about him i will never step foot in one of his establish ever again this doe not seem to bother mr goldman becaus as he told me in his letter from this even accord to him i feel that i am so influenti in this communiti that my post will dissuad peopl from visit their establish i onli wish i could attach the pdf letter that was sent to me that includ all of these love morsel of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasur of read it 

i cannot imagin ever send someth of this magnitud to an upset custom and yes i do hope that peopl read this and see that they should pick fox sport grill half moon blue 32 firehous bar and grill duke american junki or ani of the 1000 other sport bar in scottsdalephoenix to enjoy their bar food beer and sport view it is unbeliev behavior come from a busi owner and mr goldman should be asham of himself

thi is my 3rd review for d  c see the other two belowgreat food can be found anywher great servic is one in a million these day this place get an a in the most aw servic i have ever receiv and if you havehad a groupon for this place like i did dont even bother go youll be treat wors than a bothersom fli on a hot and humid day

it simpl busi put  their name out by work with daili coupon site like groupon livingsoci etc to garner new and potenti repeat custom instead after go there with my handi coupon i cant help but drive by this place on the way home and think noth but the horribl experi i receiv 

i went with my boyfriend and bought the groupon becaus i was impress due to onlin review and decid to splurg on a good ole prime rib we sit down am impress with the old school decor and then the server from azkaban appear we tell her that wed like to order off the special even menu where it a littl cheaper and tell her joy that we found this place through groupon and that it our first time wrong thing to do i dont know if it becaus past groupon dont tip well or someth but i could swear her smile immedi turn 180 degre in an instant 

it took our food the chicken and prime rib almost 33 minut to come out all we did was nom  and nom  and nom on the wateri coleslaw and gritti liver which isnt to blame sinc i was never a liver fan not onc did our server come by our tabl we watch her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tabl it was anoth server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustrat go sinc it wasnt her fault and there no use in call her out for noth we ask if she knew where our server was and she said she would look for her 10 minut later noth yet it was the new server who kept come back ask if everyth was alright like a normal server should 

then it was time for the check and we just want to get out of there sinc we were basic ignor 17 minut pass no check came even though our  tabl had been clear our server was still mia so we ask a random server to give us our check he said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didnt even want to see her face so anoth random server brought it back

w had a tabl of 4 sit next to us who even lean over and ask us whi we were be so calm when our nonexist server was treat us like crap we didnt even want to bother wait anoth 20 minut just to talk to a manag sinc appar the onli way the server here communic is by play telephon so we just left after pay the tabl besid us told us that they were go to complain for us sinc we want to leav but whether they did or not i didnt even care at that point 

to be honest i cant even rememb what the food tast like which isnt quit fair in a review i went here a coupl of month ago but i have never had an experi where servic overrod the tast of food im pretti sure prison in a cafeteria get more attent than i did

mayb it wasnt even the groupon who know all i know is that we ran out of there like usain bolt and tell anyon who ask about our worst dine experi that this is the place to experi itupdate
don c the owner repli to my comment with this dear anthoni c thank you for your rant over 2100 guest redeem their groupon in the 90 day it ran sinc 1981 i have run dcs with the guest alway in my thought veri happi to honor the 2000 you spent best wish don carson

mi repli was this
veri happi to honor the 20 i spent is groupon fine print polici so of cours you are happi to do it by not honor the full 40 valu you lost ani chanc of my be a custom and all of my friend which sinc ive live in oldtown sinc 2004 and go out daili to it restaur and bar is not a small number of peopl there are too mani other place that serv a great steak bandera citizen public hous cowboy ciao etc

you are correct mani other peopl did not get confus like i did and i am happi for them they are appar more clever than i i tri to come in i heard your messag on a monday i got confus i lost out if our role were revers i would honor the full 40 groupon for you even if you were the onli person who got confus tri to come to my restaur becaus i thought the purpos of a groupon was to get new face in the door  especi one that live walk distanc from my establish and yet has never been in

fin you say you alway have the custom in your thought call my review a rant is not good custom servic i hope that as folk read your repli they get a clearer pictur of your custom servic style  in my opinion my review describ event and my feel about those event in a logic way not as a rant

now here is the best part
groupon refund me the 20  so while don and char accus me of rant groupon who has a far larger custom base heard my stori and decid a happi custom was worth the refund  they could have ignor my request given the huge number of client they have and bare notic my decreas spend with them  that is excel in servic and i will continu to be a veri loyal groupon customer

groupon had this to say when i thank them for my refund when dc fail me
hey anthoni 

thank you so much for the feedback we appreci feedback in all form but it all the more gratifi when it posit 

youv made my day and were so happi to have a custom like you thank for your continu support 

take care

groupon custom support

thi is what fantast custom servic mean groupon has my busi forev not so dcsi have travel the world to eat in hundr of amaz restaur some mediocr and some not so goodhowev this was actual the worst restaur experi and food ive ever had
to begin my wedg blue chees salad had a long black hair buri underneath the wedge
i order chicken schnitzel
two of our parti of four order petit filet cook medium well
th waiter brought out three out of the four entre order  
the chicken dish was actual cold tough complet tasteless and disgust  i didnt touch it after the first bite
on of the two steak was miss and the other was not a filet  when i ask the waiter what cut of beef he deliv he had no ideah didnt even recogn that it was a slice of beef and not a filet
then after inform him that it wasnt a filet he took it back and the manag came over  the manag said the waiter had written down the wrong order and they were go to start cook the filet now
thirtyf minut later the waiter came back with two filet  one was butterfli which no one order and one wasnt  of cours the waiter didnt notic that the two steak he was deliv look complet differ  when i ask him whi one of the steak was butterfli even though no one had order it that way he didnt know what butterfli meant and sat there with a blank express on his face and mouth open
when our friend cut into them they were both bloodi and almost raw  
the manag came over again and said they didnt cook them right and they were go to cook them again
bi that time we all decid we had had enough  the two attempt at cook the steak proper for over an hour was so frustrat that no one in our parti want to wait ani longer
th waiter never onc mention ani problem or apolog about anything
 hair in the salad
 cold chicken
 two complet failur at cook filets
 one and a half hour in misery
honest if i could have rate this restaur with a zero i would have  ive have never hadnon of us had ever had a wors restaur and food experience
p  the waiter put the uncook steak in a doggi bag that was drip blood out of the bottom of the bag  we were given 100 of certif to return which we have decid to give to the homeless  we would never consid go there again
tri citi hall  excellent
tri capitol grill  excellent
tri ruth chris  excel by comparison
pss  i forgot to mention as ice on the cake that we never order the waiter was cough dure each visit to the tabli have such conflict leav a 1 star review for uncl sal whi becaus i love uncl sal food i have been eat here off and on for year and live close by make no mistak it some of the tastiest italian fare aroundi have never had a bad meal the problem a cockroach infest yesinfest one need onli keep one eye open in june i went to eat for my birthday as we were sit await our meal a small cockroach scurri across our tabl okon measli roachi can handl that as an anomali but when i went back again in about 4 week with a friend for lunch we wait in a back booth for 20 minut i might add for someon to take our order that a whole other storyseem the lunch wait staff becom somewhat frazzl when they get a rushan acknowledg or a simpl havent forgotten about you will be right there would have sufficedw sat wait and as we both look at the brick wall over the head of a tabl of some gentlemen have a biz lunch we both notic 23 littl roach dart in and out of the crack of the wall my friend and i simultan said are you see what i am see and agre in unison to leav as we pass our apparit of a wait person on our way out i inform this person that we were leav and whi she simpli look at me with veri littl express and said i kid you not oh i know we have roach they are just activ becaus we spray recent i inform her that one scurri across my tabl a month ago as well she just shrug sigh sorri to do this to you uncl sal but until you can have someon get in there and bomb the place and claim you are roach free i simpli have no interest in share my meal with an armi of 6 leg buggi i can onli imagin how mani of them could be lurk in the kitchen and i am no wuss bewar sad state of affair i miss you uncl sal but not that muchif give this particular locat zero star was possibl they wouldnt even receiv one 

i place a custom order on 211 to be deliv on 213 i paid an extra 25 to have it overnight to ensur it would arriv in time i explain 214 would be too late becaus the person they are for has an earli morn flight that day

i final call becaus it 3pm and it still hasnt arriv to see if i could be provid with ship inform and was told the packag was sent out this morn and i will receiv it tomorrow 

instead of offer me some type of solut i was transfer to the manag aliciaa name i see repeat in these negat review simpli told me well im the manag and there noth that can be done at this point clear you arent a compet manag becaus a better person would tri to fix the situat and make their custom who spent a lot of money on a custom orderdeliveri happy

ther is a complet lack of profession and the idea of custom servic complet escap the employe at this locatterrible

i brought my boyfriend here a while ago for a romant date out  i thought it would be great becaus they had vegetarian paella for me and plenti of fish and meat for him to tri  he doesnt normal get to do that too much sinc we go to most vegetarian places

w got an appet two entre and some sangria and even with a 25 gift card the bill was still over 90 with tip  now this would not have been an issu had the food been worth that  howev the food was terribl  it was stuck in the 80s  the beaus chicken look like someth you would get on an airplan and my paella could have been shown up by someth in a box mushi rice with frozen veg  the server also charg us for 2 salad that she just brought out  i dont mind pay for a salad but at least ask me

at one point in our meal my man got up and went to the restroom  when he return he told me that i had to go look at it  it was aw  it was wors than ani drive bar i have been to  the paint was fall off the wall one of the stall didnt have a door and the other bare lock the toilet were filthi and the sink was disgust  if you charg 2040 a plate you need to have the ambianc to back it up

nev go herei bought a groupon dinner for two as a christma gift for my mother  bad move  mom was upset enough to write her own bad review of the restaur  i didnt even know she had a yelp account

th deal sound great 49 for a dinner for two valu at up to 104 this includ two entre a pitcher of sangria and an appet  this must be some fanci restaur i thought what a nice gift for my mom

wel she end up not take her boyfriend but instead took her sister and sister husband  therefor instead of two there were three at the tabl unfortun pepin could not handl this chang grace and when place the order everybodi becam confus with the groupon deal

i wish they just told my mother your order for three is go to exceed the valu of this coupon which is for a dinner for two the coupon is for ani two dinner one appet and one pitcher of sangria  sinc your order more well give you the maximum credit for your coupon which is worth up to 104 that would have been simple

instead they made bill seem complic caus the custom to have to think too much about the bill they didnt give the full valu of the groupon and they ad a mandatori 20 gratuiti on the bill for three people

look back at the deal they gave her most of the valu of the coupon the meal cost a lot more than she calcul partial becaus she didnt calcul the valu of each item they order partial becaus the mandatori 20 gratuiti was a larg unexpect chang and partial becaus the price are overinfl 32 for a pitcher of sangria

i paid 49 for the deal and mom paid 86 in excess for a total of 135 suppos 50 off my mom and her two guest receiv one entre each they share a singl appet a singl dessert and a singl pitcher of sangria  that pretti spendi and for that much money youd think everyon would leav feel satisfi with the experi of the food and the servic  instead my mom thought it was a rip off and im left regret my purchas1030pm on a saturday night my friend and i tri our second attempt at sushi for the night see my review of pearl for the first place is hop we take a seat at the sushi bar

th waitress  are you girl go to be order sushi
m i have a sushi menu in my hand yes
waitress  would you mind put it in soon becaus they want to go home too
m what the fuck bitch uh ok

dear ra waitress

im sorri if i kept you or ani other employe especi sinc i finish eat my roll befor your kitchen even close it was complet ok to rush me even though i had no intent of stay all fuck night and even though plenti of new sushi order came after mine i was hard the last custom in there there were peopl all around me order sushi so im still unclear as to whi you need to rush me if you were in such a hurri whi did it take you longer to bring and process my bill than it did for me to eat your food mayb it was becaus you dont know how to count sinc you gave the wrong amount of chang and i end up have to tell you the correct amount sinc you couldnt count it on the spot i like ra for the atmospher someth you complet ruin thank for that   

sincerely
morgani regret went here for my birthday last night

ord the ichi roll and got a death mayo alien roll

thi was the worst thing i have ever tast 

1 it had at least a hand of mayo blahh

2 it had a pound of crab that look like redwhit spaghetti  soo gross

3 had the textur of a raw pumpkin slice in thin strings

4 tast like lick an old fish

w got the waitress to refund the sushi sinc it was uned 
when she brought the bill it was not item and we could not figur out how it came to that much
th entir time our waitress was never there never refil our drinks
w final flag her down to get a break down of the bill
sh came back with the same copy
w ask a differ person who grab her to help us
sh came to the tabl and ask do you have a problem with me wtf

we told her  ignor what she said  can you just bring us a breakdown of the bill

sh came back again with an un item copy

i would not have tip her but on parti of 6 the add 17 gratuity

which btw she ad 20 without permission

w were there for so long ad want to leav otherwis i would have disput that tip charg in full

you dont come up to custom and ask if they have a problem with you

not onli was the food the grossest shit ever the servic can suck my assyowza if i could give this spot 5 star i would

a mention in earlier review servic is truli nonexist  it quit remark at the level of who give a crap that is on display here

i took a cowork there for a holiday lunch as she has a dish there she is crazi about we arriv at one and are seat right away drink get to us eventu and we are abl to order my friend order a hous special and i order steak fajitas

whil wait for lunch to arriv our drink ran dri and we also ran out of chip while the restaur was slow with onli a hand of tabl occupi the servic was still a complet disast the wait staff was five feet away behind the bar hang out not pay ani attent to anything

eventu our food arriv and they must have invent a new strain of white beef becaus my steak fajita are white and look like chicken nugget onli drier i ask our befuddl server if i was look at chicken and he smile and repli that it was i remind him that i order steak at which point he made a gas face there was no attempt at servic deliveri make it right etc to end the silent standoff i told him i would just give the chicken a go

i am realli laid back and i like chicken so i thought it might tast okay as it turn out the chicken was so dri and it was shape like chicken nugget i have never seen chicken shape like that that was not part of  a meal you order at a drive thru move past the shape they were dri and truli tasteless to replic this dish you would need old chicken no flavor and a hatr for the peopl you were cook for

wrap up the cluster that was our lunch my friend order some takeout to bring back to her cowork we wait for anoth 20 minut and no one ever show up at our tabl so i went to the bar and ask about our bill and takeout final i was abl to pay and get the takeout bag which i gave to my pal i joke told her to check it and make sure it wasnt screw up too and she did  spoiler alert they mess up the takeout too it was complet wrong i brought the contain to the server who repli with wow everyth is mess up cheer to you good sir we agree

whil they went to fix it i saw insid the kitchen and it was pretti dirti i can truli say that was my last and final trip to frank and lupe the food isnt terribl but the servic price point and utter lack of give a shite make it a no go for me there clear is no one there to manag the busi and ensur that peopl are be care for and that qualiti control is happen do yourself a favor and find anoth spot  hell at this point taco bell on thoma  scottsdal is a better option at least you know go into it that the food will be mediocrin the order i notic things

1dirti sticki wall
2 larg amount of ant crawl around the floor
3 my carn asada tast like hamburg meat
4 fresh lipstick on my cup

i wish i could have notic our waiter but he was never anywher to be found 


nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooso i struggl with how to handl my emot and how to best communic my experi  let begin with the posit  it was a friday night april 6th mom was in town for the weekend and want to take her to a good mexican place i had been to mani time in the past  wait 30 minut but no big deal as we start on a pitcher of margarita  an interest note to begin with is the bar setup  they have decid to save 14 of the total bar space as a server prep station  when we start to drift over the tape line into this section on the bar we were shoo by one of the bus staff pretti rude imo but made me wonder  whi the hell would you steal precious bar space to have silver napkin and pitcher of water a place to sit  there are mani other spot that could have been creat for this purpose

on to the meal as alway love the option present and tri a new dish with an egg on top  love egg with my meal  my mom got fajita and love them as well finish off the meal and the origin pitcher was quit a challeng as the portion are veri healthi  the margarita was the hous varieti and not that flavor pretti much water down  that when the rate hit the floor

upon finish my margarita i set my glass down and notic someth in my glass whoa that a roach  not sure exact how it got there whether it  was in the pitcher of margarita or in my glass the whole time but either way complet disgust   at this point all the food was gone and so was the roach margarita so what to do  well sinc i realli valu yelp review and this is not someth i caught at the begin of the meal i decid to hold my thought for this review no get free meal or make a scene becaus honest the food was good and i dont like get stare at as i explain the circumst  so for everyon to see as proof im go to attempt to upload the photo from that night  if a roach got into my glass i wonder what els roach have gotten into at this restaur  let just leav it at i wont be go backat about 7 pm we arriv a bunch of pilot flight attend and mechanicsmainten  about 14 they were abl to seat us with in 10 minut i was stoked

w are all seat outsid it was such a beauti night last night it was soo nice the waiter come up and say hi but we had to ask him his name and he was way to relax not veri outgo at all he gave me the feel like we interrupt his smoke break my bad 

while we were wait for our food i ask for some bread they brought out a littl plate of mayb 810 piec of bread on it keep in mind we all have not eaten sinc befor noon that day and we all look at the plate like um ok 

when the food final came i was soo excit the whole place had smell amaz sinc walk up from the park lot which was kinda small and pack but i was quick disappoint the pizza was soo thin the top fell right off the pizza and there was virtual no sauc at all  the crust was the best part of the whole thing 

mi friend and i decid to get a piec of cheesecak to hope save the meal nope not even close i almost want to cri cheesecak is my all time most favorit dessert and it was ruin 
the crust was waxi and just gross the cake part tast a littl weird kinda like the crust and to mushi like they didnt give it enough time to set it was aw 

their menu has salad appet pizza and calzon and desert that it no pasta or anyth els so there isnt much to choos from  their water with lemon was my favorit part of the meal sad 

over all 
the bathroom were decent 
park was not to great
th food suck 
servic could have been way better 
and it was way overpr 

if i ever go back im just gonna order water with extra lemonrealli  5 star i smell a set up  the owner and staff have never been nice or polit or respect to anyon he onc chase a custom down the street scream like a littl girl to the custom  no one in the valley has receiv review this good  dont believ them he must have had his littl kiss ass chorus write them  what a jokewhen we arriv we order a beer each and some calamari to hold us over until the cal game start the gal behind the bar was somewhat rude to begin with mayb she had a bad day we then order salad and pasta for dinner with wine she was perturb that we were plan to share the order rather than order an entre each the game final start and fan for both team were rootingscream as usual and the owner came over to me and told me i was too loudeven though everyon els was cheer all the same we even bought a beer for the guy sit next to us who was bet on louisvill she wrote up our bill even though we werent finish with the meal nor possibl order of dessert etc and told us to leave

this was by far the weirdest worst restaur experi of my life these guy need to be shut down or need a chang of ownership you cant treat peopl the way they do and just get away with it becaus they are a  new york style restaur  ive been to new york and the cabbi have more class than this man their 3 12 star rate is a jokehorribl horribl horriblei that the soup nazi i see in the kitchenno it the owneromg stay far far awayif you look at my two other yelp review you will see posit review of a coupl of restaur ive been to normal if a restaur is lame which is rare i wont even review it but i am go to enjoy eviscer this truli repuls restaur not for the food which was somewhat edibl but for the dishonest price and for the jerk who appar own the place

mi girlfriend carol and i were walk through scottsdal it was just past noon on a recent sunday so we were think about lunch we pass italian grotto and saw a menu post outsid on the wall the lunch part of the menu had most entre at 8 ill treat you to lunch she said sound good said i

w went in and there were veri few custom three or four peopl were sit at the bar we were seat quick the server who was polit brought us menus the first thing we notic was that there were no 8 item on it all of the lunch item were price at 13 or more so we ask the server about the menu on the outsid of the build here what he said yes those are 8 item if you get them al la cart of cours al la cart suggest that you can get say the bake ravioli for 8 if you get noth els on the side but then the server ad but these item do come with either soup or salad hmmm it clear sound like he was say the lunch special was 8 and you still got a soup or salad carol and i look at each other and shrug our shoulder i order the bake ravioli she order a veget pasta disheach of these were 8 on the outsid menu but 13 on the menu he hand us he clear intim that we were order item as a lunch special we also order  a side of garlic bread and one ice tea that all we ordered

a we await our meal there was some person stand around the lobbi and i heard him say someth loud about jew which got my attent he seem drunk and a coupl of the server were stand around him so i thought some idiotand tune him out and rememb this was just after noon

th food arriv and was fine i got exact four mediums ravioli on my plate along with a salad the drunk guy was quiet but still stand around the lobbi like he own the place he look a bit like donald trump same age and attitud and he wore a coupl of rather larg gold earring in his left ear

aft we ate we got the check and were shock to see that it total 40 not onli that but the entre were written down as 14 each what kind of weird mistak was this carol who doesnt mind confront issu like this had me wait at the tabl while she went to find the waiterthen i heard the loud guy yap at her i did not hear what he was say but it sound at a distanc like he was argu with her as my attent turn to him my girlfriend laugh a coupl of time and i thought that this guy must be the manag or owner carol is from long island and is use to new york attitud so i figur all was good this onesid convers last 5 minut or so then she came back with the bill and roll her eye say let get outta here

a it turn out the owner onli deduct that extra two dollar from the bill from 14 to 13 per entre and accord to carol he reek of alcohol and act drunk and obnoxi he ask her to get a load of the queer at the bar and that was just the begin of his tirade

sh said that the owner wonder whi i the boyfriend wasnt pay the bill and that no woman should pay when a man can pay i have six daughter and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date the boyfriend would never be welcom in the hous carol think that the guy was just tri to act like a macho new yorker told him that she was from long island in respons he said long island isnt new york onli spoil brat live on long island i grew up in manhattan in chelsea on 29th and 9th 

he ask carol whi we were in scottsdal she said we live in tucson and have been visit arcosanti he said whi would you live in tucson it a dump i had a bagel busi on 1st ave in tucson and it was a terribl place he also ad i was at arcosanti a few year ago and it was dirti and hippi live there i suppos this was the point in the convers when carol laugh and walk away

a we were walk back to our car and carol was relat this stori we knew that this inform need to get out and see what mani other have written about this restaur i think you can see we arent exagger 

the owner of italian grotto is some drunken misanthrop name gari horowitz so whi his comment about jew and no one should be support his business

the waiter will was love howevin a nutshel this restaur has the rudest staff of ani restaur ive ever eaten at in my life 

i came here on a beauti new year day afternoon with my boyfriend and my dog befor sit down i ask one of the server on staff if it was alright for me to have my dog sit down by our tabl while we ate shes fifteen year old and was on a leash at the time which i explicit said he said it was absolut fine no problem whatsoev so i went to seat myself at the veri end of the patio furthest away from all the other tabl so as to not disturb ani other guest who might come along  it was total empty

about fifteen minut later while my boyfriend was in the bathroom i gave my mom a quick call sinc she was wonder what time wed be get done eat in the middl of my convers with her i heard someon talk loud and aggress next to me so i look over and he was stare angrili at me i ask him what he had said and he act like i had affront him so he even more angrili boom i said get off your phone now and move your dog now pleaaas i was utter confus not just by his psychot rude but by what he meant by that my dog was lay at my feet under the tabl not in anyon way at all he start talk about how it was his tabl and his chair and i had better get off the phone and was wave his hand and point at the chair where i had tether her leash all while my mom was talk to me in my ear veri disori but final i understood that he want me to tether her to a differ chair even though there were 40 other empti chair around us he could have use to seat the coupl instead in fact the tabl they were be seat at alreadi had two chair bizarre

i veri calm told him that he didnt have to speak so rude he start go off about how i have no idea what im talk about and i dont respect anyon els space and i was take up two tabl and it his chair so he can tell me what to do with it sinc i had final hung up it click oh this is your restaur i was total baffl how someon who actual want to run a success establish would treat his custom like common crimin yes maam mine that was all i need to hear we immedi left

im in total shock this guy has an axe to grind with his custommy husband and i had a nice dinner outsid howev when i went to use the bathroom the owner stop me  and told me i had  90 second to use the bathroom he had two girl bang in the door i told him he owe me a apolog and he call me a nasti name he was veri rude and i would never go back i would have call the polic but i was visit my veri ill brother pleas dont go here he should be shut down we spent 60 dollar and this is how he treat his custom i hope this post stop peopl from eat there and he shut downatroci disrespect insan mental unstabl and high on weed father son duostay away 

first off the owner let in peopl who came way after my famili and me the onli reason was becaus he seem to be more friend with them than his other custom we order and the servic was ok as to what happen afterward my daughter vegetarian soup had pork in it which we dont eat we told the owner and were expect a nice apolog no what we got was way wors he start lectur us about how no one perfect i didnt come here to get a lesson i came here for a peac friend dinner for my father in law birthday i have to make this short it too long to write at the end his demon son end up kick us out even though we were alreadi leav he tri to make it seem like we were be kick out unbeliev dont go here the owner yell even at childrenterribl 
two peopl two lunch one appet the app crab wonton was deliv first and had a good flavor sweet and sour sauc that i use to flavor the rest of my food one star for the appetizer
i see that even though you may order your food on the same ticket as your date the food come out one at a time which meant that my food was deliv and sinc my date and i didnt care to share dish we both sat there awkward wait for his while my food got cold 
spici korean was neither spici nor korean nor did it have ani flavor at all but it had a shitload of carrot for all you rabbit out there i find it amus that garbag restaur think a sprinkl of sesam seed sudden make food korean it doesnt and your market suck 
the crown jewel of this fiasco came down to a competit between the dan dan noodl and the bird while i was attempt to choke down my toosoft spaghetti drown in too much sugarysweet brown sauc littl grisli bit of chicken and a hand of bean sprout that i tri valiant to save with some hot sauc and fail miser the bird were stalk us one bird attempt to make his domin attempt known to the other bird by yip at them and follow them around like a nag old wife chase her husband with a roll pin this continu as they wait for us to finish our food so that we could leav so that they could attack the leftov i eventu gave up on my food and just stop eat it was that bad by the time we were finish and stand up to leav no less than fifteen bird were advanc toward our tabl we took the dirti foodfil plate insid to turn them in but that didnt stop the bird from descend on the tabl in search of ani bit of miss rice that may have fallen onto the groundthe view is awesom too bad the food and servic are not at the same level to complet the total package

i do not mind pay 300 for a great dine experi and have travel the world do so  element just doesnt match up

i made a reserv to celebr my partner 50th birthday base on review i had read on yelp  at the time of the reserv i mention the birthday event and partner name to see what element would do   the answer was zero no problem but just one of the mani place element miss the mark

w arriv earli and enjoy cocktail in the jade bar even ok that they deliv the wrong drink  at our schedul time we move to the dine room to be told that they were run late and would get a tabl as soon as possibl  i know this happen occasion  when i made the reserv i realiz that there were some primo tabl that everybodi rave about and i am of the belief that it is either the luck of the draw or be pushi and assert that determin seat silli me i thought a 50th could influenc  while we would have been comfort almost anywher we where shown to what has to be the worst tabl in the room  the tabl is at the back of the dine room situat between the two door that server use for kitchen access  in the 3 minut we were at the tabl there was a constant parad of server on both side of our tabl  the fact that this tabl exist speak loud about the prioriti of this establishment

our second tabl was primo and we thought that we were on to a great dine experi  the wait staff is cold and at time near rude  there was noth about ani of the staff that was welcom includ the bar host and server  after starter i went to use the toilet and when return found my dinner on the tabl not terribl but to me anoth faux pas that should not have happen  we were each given 2 piec of bread and when the plate was empti it was remov it would have been nice to have been ask if we would have like more

th food itself rang from veri good to ok  lobster red pepper bisqu was good though lukewarm pork appet was the best dish  my duck breast main was tough and did not have ani notic flavor ad just duck

w did enjoy the chocol dessert  when we request the check it was drop so quick no thank you for dine i hope you enjoy your even and the waitress gone that i did not get to hand her my in the readi credit card

i was all set to realli enjoy element base on the review but they seem to be quit busi so i am sure that will not miss my lack of return visitdonald s just remind me i had not review the villag tavern yet

eat at your own risk i can onli tell you my experi and you do with it what you like 

i la la la love the food here use to dine in regular and happi hour often until 

dun dun dun dun one even my girlfriend and i rendezv at the tavern for a littl happi hour it was not happi and we left in well under an hour just after be sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat it would have made ny proud 

we pack it in and disappear into the night never to return  sad tale for a place i love so much it like break up with someon you still have feel for but you know it the right thing to doive never actual eaten here so im not sure how amaz the food is and i will not be find out ani time soon 

here is my experiencei walk into the restaur for dinner and there was no one in sight the maitr dee ask my name for a reserv and i state i was a walk in he saidlet me see what i have but you may be sit in a room by yourself he proceed to say let me see to these guest and then ill tri to seat you  an older coupl was still outsid walk up that he felt where a prioriti over find me and my guest a tabl as i was stand in the doorway complet embarrass in front if my guest and think about how demean the person was i walk out and decid not to eat here 

this place may have amaz food and amaz cocktail but i was not abl to get past the servic  i will not be go back nor would i ever recommend someon subject themselv to that kind of treatmentseriouslyf this place  disgust food and shitti servic ambienc is great if you like to dine in a hot cellar engulf in stagnat air  truli it is over rate over price and they just under deliv  forget tri to order a drink here it will take forev to get and when it final doe arriv you will be readi to pass out from heat exhaust and lack of oxygen  how that for a head chang you dont even have to pay for it

i wont disgust you with the detail review of everyth i have tri here but to make it simpl it all suck  and after you get the bill you will be walk out with a sore ass  save your money and spare your self the disappointive eaten here mani time but none as bad as last night
servic was excel and high attentive
food absolut horrible

mi expect was they would serv a steak on par with their seafood after all they were charg 39 buck for a ribey 
what i was hope for was a 1 112 thick steak cook pittsburgh style as i had order 
what i got a a 34 in thick piec of meat that was most fat gristl and in no way resembl pittsburgh style 
salad similar to someth you could get at chick filet
veggi blah
bread basket ampl but day old and if not it certain wasnt fresh 

in addit to bad food we were cram into a small room where we were nut to butt with 6 other tabl listen to convers rang from someon recent bout with pinkey and anoth coupl who elect to speak entir in french until the waiter show up then it was like they turn off the french switch and sudden began speak english 

ive had it with this place
if im go to pay 150 buck for dinner itll be at morton or maestro where the steak are 112 in thick cook to perfect and half of it doesnt wind up on the plate as fat and gristlno way  went there in plenti of time of befor groupon expir date and got a stori that they are book until expir  they would not honor for the groupon valu after that date even though it was their fault that we couldnt get in  no i will not spend the lesser amount come back to salt cellar  they will get no money from me  groupon will refund my payment  rude rude manag  no desir to eat therefraudul barstaffjust move to the neighborhoodcheck this place out on a sunday afternoonfood was good servic was goodthought we could make this our local went back on saturday afternoon first bartend was awesom and put on boston celtic game for us  were quit enjoy ourselv hang with some canadian on vacat but the femal bartend was pretti rude throughout the nitetot not enjoy herself or the peopl she was serv  when we went to pay our check she was a right out cow  somi husband didnt leav a tip and the next day we found out she put through 22 buck for a tip even tho we fill in 0000 total unauthor  left a messag for the manag who eventu refund itbut never call  if it wasnt for the antic of the dbag behind the counter wouldnt mind headin back  just bewar and take not of your statement if you decid to hang out there this place has gone way down hill lately

 been go to defalco for almost seven year and i cant say ill ever go back after my recent experience

mi friend and i stop in on the afternoon of april 8th to get some food from start to finish the custom servic was offens the man take our order never made eye contact never thank us and seem to be more annoy than anything

aft about 20 minut of wait for our food one of the server came out to the patio where we were sit and call out my number again this guy seem almost to the point of be open angri with me for no appar reason he brought out my dish slam it down on the tabl along with my silverwar and storm back inside

aft five or so minut of wait for my friend food he went insid to ask for it when he got insid he discov his food had been sit on the take out counter when he had in fact order it for dine in when he check it to make sure it was what he had order he found that the order was not correct when he ask to have it fix the manag on duti question him sever time as if my friend was the one who had made the mistak again this guy seem anger by our presenc he proceed to shout back at the cook to fix the meal who then shout back at him a few minut later the same angri server brought our food out to the patio where i had been sit and eat by myself

th onli save grace was that the food still tast good howev i will definit not be go back to this place as long as the custom get treat the way we were treat that dayi am sit here as i type this  my wife her parent and i were visit from out of town and decid to drop by an italian deli for lunch  first this place is closer to a deli youd find on new york rather than one in itali  in line i heard two peopl order fettuccin alfredo for lunch 

so here our order  one prosciutto sandwich one if the few italian item on the menu  one italian sausag sandwich one portobello sandwich and one chees panini  while i was order  the cashier  the owner kept give me an odd looklik who do you think you order here  i also got a beer which was on display  when i ask for it  he didnt know what it was so i had to show him the bottl  also the request to have a doubl espresso and tea made later seem to give him and an associ all kind of inconveni  

here what we got
th prosciutto sandwich was good albeit a bit greasy
th italian sausag sandwich was ok
th portobello sandwich never arriv  instead we got anoth half of a sausag sandwich  when i told this to the server he said if you want portobello ill make you one  no apolog no care   when it final came out it was bad
th chees panini which had bacon in it was nasty

when i went to ask for a knife  the owner said that they should be out by the soda machin  i inform him they were not  he scream for ernesto to bring out the knive and told me the should be out soon i think  also got first apolog of the day

th espresso was atroci  it beyond word how bad it is   realli aw seriously

fin  to add injuri to insult we were overcharg 50c   this was explain as a comput error  we got the money back

wil never return this is the worst coffe shop i have experienc by far
mi best buddi mr s who is probabl read this review hola shashi  suggest this place sinc one of his buddi was rave about how good this place was wrong 
     the servic is unfriend and super slow i order a simpl 16oz ice nonfat caramel macchiato and they instead made it with whole milk and deni it was whole i was like serious this undeni is whole milk the color consist and flavor was scream out yes im whole milk cream chees in roll loud obnoxi music you have to scream to talk this is the epitom of trendi ra doesnt serv sushi they serv pretenti hype 

give me authent give me style give me an experi that doesnt make my ear ring 

simpli there are far superior place to go for sushi 

oh but what if you dont go for the food are you go for the social scene the drink to be with the incrowd oh then ignor my rate im onli concern with the fishim not a frequent yelp user howev this is best resourc i can think of to share my experi with rich who is the manag of raoff of mill avenu  i call into ra for a pick up order at 523pm i check my phone log and later had to prove my call to the manag for 2 roll  edamam the girl who help me quot 30 minut until my food was readi  when i arriv she told me they need about anoth ten minut she offer to give me a call onc it was prepar which was nice of her to offer too bad it didnt happen after wait back in my car for 1015 minut i still hadnt receiv a call i walk back in to ra and ask to speak with the manag  rich came out and introduc himself and i explain that i was still wait on my food and it had been 50 minut now for two roll come on one was a california roll he left to check on it a minut later the hostess return with my food  rich return and said oh good you got your food i said yes i did howev it took over 50 minut  rich respond with well what do you want me to do isnt it manag role to ensur custom receiv good servic  i call in my food at 523pm mind you the receipt shown to me by rich was timestamp with the receipt print out time of 538pm i then show rich my call log of when i call ra  he left me and proceed to check sever of his comput and return say your clock run fast the food onli took 28 minut to come out and werent you told it would take 30 minut i have att iphon 5s which provid time from a satellit  i said you are insinu that the att network cant keep time and not that the hostess rang in my food late  regardless i call ra at 523pm and the food came out at 613 again not a sorri not a oh my we were so slam which import side note they were far from slam he was just blame att for provid me with a cell phone clock that run fast and cant keep time  what an incred stupid thing to say luckili for him i had a long day at work as a properti manag for 430 apart safe to say i know when i am be treat with a lack of custom servic as custom servic is what i do day in and day out so i just stop reach for an apolog or wait for him to offer anyth that might improv my experi he left with my receipt and gave me a credit of about 450 

i guess moral of the stori rich take no pride in ensur time servic with a friend attitud hed rather blame the custom hope your manag read this rich and can offer you some train in custom servic sinc restaur need that to thrive sure negat onlin review cant be beneficii cant be ani clearer about this this was the absolut worst pizza i have ever eaten in my life

i understand the averag review befor my write is 45 star but i simpli cannot conceiv of this idea somehow after the first rancid slice i was abl to continu through almost two more slice befor my disgust overwhelm my hunger i dont care if im use to great pizza in chicago there has got to be someth in betweendue to my downtown temp locat ive been get flyer from guss tape onto my door for year  a coupl night ago i had a wick hunger smack me in the face around 1am so i decid to give guss pizza a shot

guss flyer all scream about onlin order so i wander to their site and thought id give that a tri  i notic right away that next to their 150 deliveri charg was a 49 cent servic fee  be a poor colleg student i decid to skip the fee and just call in for takeaway  

i call speak to some almostunintellig knucklehead and order my 18 pepperoni sausag and garlic use one of the mani coupon that have collect on my desk  knucklehead say twenti minut and i thank him chuckl at amus youtub video for ten minut and then make the five minut drive to guarante that my pizza will be fresh from the oven

i hit up delhi palac a coupl time a month so i know the locat but i had never been insid guss befor  i was immedi unimpress  behind the counter was some midforti guido complet with slick back hair and gold chain around his neck and a coupl of other guy who appear to be tri as hard as they could to avoid working

i tell them im here and guido turn to chump number one whose job it appar was to make my pizza it turn out he hadnt done so yet so he toss it togeth threw it in the oven and told me itll be readi as soon as it readi  i pay use cash to avoid yet anoth fee sit down and listen to the banter between the knucklehead behind the counter and the disturb douchebag at the tabl behind me who appar like women much shorter than him that he can domin  mother watch your daughter  no not the one at asu the one in junior high  

mi pizza was final done after about 15 minut of angri bird so i took it home and pop open the box  the top all appear to be right but the smell was off  who know mayb they use the magic ingredi that make their pizza as good as all of the onereview fivestar sockpuppet who have review guss say it is but no  instead im eat bland crust oversweet sauc and some form of dri chunk of garlic rather than the fresh garlic i was expect between my meh pepperoni and tombstonequ sausage

it import to tri mani thing in life but now that ive tri guss pizza i can safe say ill never be back  i dont care how drunk or hungri i may be and how late it has gotten guss is off the listthis place is disgust gross it so gross it almost disrespect do they serious expect peopl to eat this well i guess they do expect dumb peopl to eat this and the onli peopl who are dumb enough to eat this i guess are the load of asu student in the area oh wait it make sens now they are still in busi becaus drunk asu kid eat food from one of the few place that is open 247

do not get chicken as a pizza top it bread chicken pizza dough was gross soggi not done well the sauc was super wateri and tast bad as well we order garlic knot and well the same thing here in fact the garlic knot had no garlic there was just some garlic sauc on the side and some marinara tast like crap i think i had the worst pizza ive ever had in my life i think frozen pizza tast 10x better

guss is disgust i think if you want to make pizza at home youd do a much better job even if you cant make microwav popcornthe peopl who run this place are straight up crimin 

i grew up on the east coast and i was pretti swast one night and had their pizza at a friend place and it remind me of the ny style pizza back home i tri them sober and while the style is there the flavor is not if you want pizza with the aftertast of a bucket full of bloodi vomit eat at guss if you want chees with question expiri eat at guss if you want stale crust eat at guss if you want the folk who make the jersey shore cast look like british nobil at the counter to treat you like complet garbag while your in the storefront itself eat at guss 


the last time i got pizza deliv from them it took them the better part of 2 hour to get the cold pizza to my doorstep a mile and a half away on a thursday night when i got there i tip the driver generous anyway even though he was clear bake out of his gourd and the pizza was near destroyedseri did he drive through a destruct derbi on the way is that whi the pizza took so long i paid over the phone with a card and tip with cash 

he took it upon himself to tip himself again on the sign receipt line so i end up pay almost 40 dollar for their smallest pizza with all the surcharg and doubl tip when i call to talk to a manag i was told that there was noth they could do to refund the money but that he would talk to the driver and let him know that wasnt cool yeah no straight up theft and credit card fraud isnt cool i told the guy on the phonewho know if it was actual a manag that his respons wasnt even remot appropri and that i would be call my credit card compani to do a chargeback he back pedal and told me to come into the store and hed give me both tip back in cash i told him to do someth lascivi with whatev hellbeast gave birth to him

so should you eat at guss onli if you dont valu your time money health digniti or temper 

youd be much better off get some pizza from slice on mill or nativ new yorker or nypd they all have the good new york style without all the garbag slather on top and for far cheaperi am ask conscienti consum who believ in vote with their dollar to boycott this establish becaus they tow the car of pay customers

a week ago me and three friend met at the ihop intern  hous of pancak on apach and forrest   i left a huge tip to make up for the fact that we didnt purchas all that much food and the waiter was quit nice when one friend arriv at ihop he thought we were meet by my dorm which is liter across the street and walk over so he park at ihop call us and walk across the street and in less than 30 second walk back across the street and into ihop

hi car was tow while he was insid ihop we walk out couldnt find his car and didnt panic we knew in our heart that as pay custom an honest mistak was made and they would take care of us nope not the case i immedi went back in and ask for the reciept which the cashier gave me she was veri nice and apologet and reassur as i did that the one whos car was tow was on the phone with the tow contractor who told him we need to get a note from ihop manag ok easi enough so we ask and he began write the note and then for whatev reason he call the tow company

becaus the tow compani pay spotter you know that this tow is lucrat for them if they pay a spotter to look for student saw him cross the street he refus to write a note say that we were pay custom 

i still cant believ this happen we argu with him for a while start out quit nice but it degener i swear the manag was smile for most of the time while tell us there was noth he could do ultim he lie to us and said it was the respons of the hotel becaus they had contract with the tow compani so far we have been unabl to resolv this in a reason way

it kill me how busi here treat student becaus there are so mani of us they realiz that they can treat us poor and take advantag of us all over the place and no matter how mani they drive away there will alway be more student i feel realli powerless about this i dont know what i can do to fix it except tell everyon what happen so i am ask you to pleas not go to ihop while they maintain this polici of abus student we can fight back by boycot themokay befor i start talk about food let me tell you that be an indian student i have had the best and worst of indian food and i was prepar for anyth when i enter the restaurant
i was also a bit cautious regard the servic sinc my friend had a harrow time with the manag a tale for anoth day onc seat the waitercumfloor manag impati prod us for the order 5 time in a gap of 5 minut irrit alreadi we hurri and went for onion pakora for starter few roti paneer masala and aloo gobi for the main cours 
the decor was bore and dull with roll of curtain careless hang from the wall sinc aesthet hard matter to me i ignor it 
the food did not arriv for 25 minut and neither did the peski waiter look around we found all the waiter have a great time share anecdot and sip on a drink 
final after 30 minut the main cours arriv without the starter be serv i could not imagin what excus the manag could give when we were the onli custom in the restaur 

the food was good curri was done with medium spice just like we order the naan were just about right although the mango lassi wasnt the best overal we were pleas with the food just when i was think that the place wasnt too bad the waiter interrupt us hand over the chequ and ask us to pay immedi sinc the cash regist was close i was stun  we had just start with our meal  although i was furious i polit repli that the payment will be done soon after we are done 
10 minut after the floormanag take time off from chat with the staff and with all the courtesi ask us to pay up soon that was it we quick gobbl the food paid and left the place in disgust 

the food was worth 3 star but i will never ever visit delhi palac again not now not ever for a good indian meal i would suggest visit chutney  kabab palac or even drop by my hous you will not be disappointnever have i been so disrespect by an employe at an establish  mayb you should think about how you make money and how creat a bad rap for yourself hurt onli you

i went in last night for one beer about 9pm and sat at the littl outsid bar deal in the back the femal bartend was pass out calendar and drink coupon to everyon at the bar except me she total skip over me and when i ask where mine i got a total fuck attitud she told me i never ask for one and i explain im not a mind reader and she should have offer she didnt offer to get more she didnt apolog whatev a coupl minut later the coupl two stool down from me said this is a great calendar and i repli that i wouldnt know the bartend then flip out and start tell the coupl not me how she has no problem own these stupid asu kid that cant handl their liquor way to judg bitch im not an asu student and ive onli had 12 beer at this point 

i call for a manag and told him i have 12 a beer left im not pay for it im leav and never come back and im go to tell everyon i know about how rude your bartend is 

he gave me all sort of free coupon for the block parti 1 drink coupon and of cours that calendar i want im still not go back ever no matter hot skankili hot the cocktail waitress areover the last year ive notic a rapid declin in the qualiti of servic at rula bula it use to be my favorit place to wash away my colleg woe but now i dont ever want to go back

on a friday night in may i was out celebr a friend birthday with a group of 1012 peopl we were all order food booz and overal have an excel time when time come to mosey on home the waitress inform me that my credit card has been lost problem 1 if a guest credit card is lost a manag should alway come discuss this with the guest not the server

th waitress maddi was horrifi and worri and suggest i leav my phone number with her so if she found it she could call me she also gave me a comp beer which i later found out wasnt comp but a beer she paid for herself true true to her word i receiv a phone call short after close that night for a varieti of reason i was unabl to pick up my card for a few day becaus of this rula bula put a pend charg on my credit card for 25 becaus my card was left overnight

ther no excus for poor servic lost card noncomp drink after such an egregi mistak and no real apolog the manag realli dont seem to care which is an attitud that rub off on mani of the employe save for maddi 

im sad to say goodby to the best guin in town but i simpli cant keep justifi the poor servic and lack of concern for custom satisfacta tale of two pizza in scottsdal part ii  
  well this is in north temp but close enough

grrr

im from the san francisco bay area where you can find good italian restaur all over the place  im also italian in heritag  i have been eat and cook italian food for much of my life and i know what it like to mix ingredi in the right proport to make a pasta sauc that need at least five hour simmer time to tast just right  i had pass lo cascio mani time on my way out of scottsdal back to temp and look at the build with some anticipationit look a lot like some of the old italian place that i grew up near

rec i final took my famili out to eat at this place  upon walk in i note the distinct decor on the wall that told me that this place special in sicilian cuisin and i was look forward to that characterist tast  i order a pizza rememb the tast of the veri thin and incred pie serv to my father and i in napl a decad ago  im awar that napl isnt in sicili but i was look forward to real southern italian charact to my dinner that night  my wife order an eggplant parmesan and my daughter opt for a simpl chees ravioli

i was awar that my pizza was like not go to have the same depth of flavor as the astound one that i ate in itali but i was expect someth authent and delici  what i got serv to me was a fcking frozen pizzanot even a name brand like digiorno or tombston but someth on the level of the cheap bargain frozen pizza that you find on the bottom shelf of the supermarket freezer  you know the one that 2 for 7  it was putrid  now i have to admit that i have no proof that the pizza i got serv was frozen but ive had enough cheap pizza to know that bland cardboardi tast  totino tast better for over 12 less

i order a salad too5 for a hand of iceberg lettuc with two hunk of tomato and two goddamn olives

mi wife eggplant parmesan was noth special  she order mix veget with it  fresh  nopebird eye

mi daughter got serv what i refer to as the italian scamseven chees ravioli in lowqual tomato sauc for 15  mani italian restaur pull the scam on you becaus most of us are gullibl enough to buy the bullsht that a plate full of noodl and sauc should be expens becaus it italyan  this just top off a bad experi for us

good part  the bread wasnt authent but was yummi and load with sesam seed  servic was fantast but that wasnt enough to save this place

thi place was an insult to italian cook in general let alon sicilian  i dont care how mani map of sicili they have around or how mani triskelion head they put on the wall and the menu this joint aint sicilian in ani meaning sens of the word  lo cascio made this secondgener italianamerican veri angri  there are good pasta place around the valley but i would avoid this spot at all costi just receiv a compliment tonight under the your funni head from an individu name leonardo m concern my review for this restaur  the compliment state in whole

i guess your review was meant to be funni frozen pizza and birdsey frozen veget iceberg lettuceitalian from san francisco you may have been in oliv garden or better yet buca di beppo my mother is from napl and my father from sicili weve spent time in both place mayb italian food in sf has been too american over the year sorri you had a bad experience

thi leonardo charact has no review no yelp friend and just start on yelp this last septemb 2013  a person with such stat wouldnt have ani busi or interest make a comment like that to me unless he was the owner so im go to address this compliment to me as if i came from the owner

so no leonardo i wasnt tri to be funni  yes i got a warmedup frozen pizza for my entre and a tini salad compos of iceberg lettuc for an addit 5  my wife mediocr meal had tasteless frozen veget on the side  that not funny

you know what the sad thing is  you didnt even tri to make it better  my famili and i get one of the worst italian meal of our live and all you felt motiv to do was insult me and my tast in food

i grew up on restaur like westlak joe in dali citi bertolucci in south san francisco banchero in hayward and a host of incred italian cook from the north beach area of san francisco itself  if you went to the owner of these restaur and told them that their food was too american compar to your you would either end up with a spiffi pair of cement shoe or at least with a hors head on your pillow next to you the morn  okay now im tri to be funny

if this was just an off night and you want to show me how good your food realli was you could have serious apolog to me  you could have invit my famili back serv us up a wonder meal and i would have been back here on yelp tell everyon to never mind about the previous bad review  i would have been happi to do that

but no you decid to insult me instead  that a shamefar more of a shame than just serv me a bad dinner  all i can say now is that it appear that bad tast goe far deeper in this restaur than just the food

upd 13014

the morn after i put up this review updat i receiv two more compliment  the first was by a man name robert k from chandler someon who has no yelp friend and about 40 review who thought enough about what i wrote abov to call me a butthurt littl child at 627 am  a respons from leonardo came about an hour later and his name mysteri chang to leonard  he claim that he wasnt the ownerjust a patron for sever year who never had that kind of experi at lo cascio  i wont buy that stori ani more than ill buy food at this restaur againthis place is ridiculous
 had pretti mediocr food from here a few time but it down the street from my hous so i think i just keep hope it will get better the carn asada is total bland and their quesadilla are practic ined the one good thing is their salsa and bean dip

so i just call to place a take out order for a side of bean dip the woman inform me that chip do not come with the bean dip and it would be 199 extra for them do most peopl eat bean dip without chip ok fine i will pay the 199 then i ask if salsa is includ with the cost of chip to which she repli no salsa is extra as well i hung up everyth they were tri to charg me for is free if i was go to sit there and eat my bean dip 

i think i have final given up on this place
just go to cheba hut next door we were here for 3 hour not by choic but becaus it took our server that long to take our order deliv our drink bring our food hand us our check and take our money 

in that time i got to eat dri out chicken and luke warm french fri and drink a flat soda not onli that but we had no silverwar so i had to person get up and retriev fork straw and napkin for us to all use 

i didnt know i had a second career in waitress it suckif you start with a dos gringo mexigril  take away all the crazi sign you get this macayo with it all patio look insid  out  here what happened

everyth start out 4stars

  i was seat in a comfort booth insid  my friend server ashley show up right away bring me a huge bowl of chip  a cup of salsa to start with

  i order one of their everi day lunch combo that in this case consist of a shred beef taco a carnita tamal cheesetop refri bean  spanish rice

  my order arriv in a short time attract present on a toohottotouch platter  nice  the serv were generous too  were off to a great start here

slip to 3stars

th salsa for the chip  the taco was super mild  i prefer it at least medium  the bean were good but the spanish rice wasnt as good as i make  while the tamal had plenti of meat in it it was pretti blah tasting

drop like a rock to 1star

ashley bring me my bill for 699 plus tax  i pay with a 20  back come my chang which should have been 1236 in the form of 1 x 10 2 x 1 a quarter a dime  a penni  instead she pocket the 36  give me 2 x 5  a 2  now accord to emili post the proper tip for this bill with good servic is 105 round off to 1  instead i am given the choic between the 36 that ashley has stolen or 236 reward her by 225 for the two shenanigan not count the 2 five instead of a ten 

i had a dollar bill in my wallet  left it on the tabl so that im not the bad guy here but screw this place  1starive been go here for mani year actual sinc well befor the new owner came in and renam it stray cat for a long time i realli enjoy the drink and dinner specials

 notic the food servic slide down hill quick this year earlier this year i brought some of my visit famili to the busi becaus the food and servic had been so awesom to that point for some reason they had a useless cook work that day who burnt everyth he sent out to us  twice the owner on site was so embarrass after we show him what was serv he offer us gift card to cover our food my famili vow never to return i figur it was a fluke and was impress that the owner acknowledg the problem and did someth to address it

wow i immedi went to the bar and request to speak to the owner who had iron just left i gave a printout of the messag sent back and forth to a server who know me well told her what happen and ask to have the owner contact me no contact what so ever

if this is how they treat a longtim patron now imagin what this place is head for save your money for a busi that actual care about the peopl bring cash through the door 

that snarki messag was it for me im doneappar i stand correct and this place is still open mayb they were just spray for crab when i walk by it was board up but now a fulli function bump and grind enjoythe old hous is a fit name for this joint a old hous that has not seen a pest extermin in year an old hous that still serv food from the yester year ive been here on mani occas and the food is alway  fair to poor the filet mignon is either a joke or from some other anim i have never heard of the salad wilt the crouton stale the bread stale even the smell in this place is stale i hesit befor write this review but 4 out of 5 visit were aw i realli yes realli did see a roach on my last and final visit the servic is incred slow even when the place is empti go somewher els for a steak it worth the extra few buckim realli not a fan of this place an quit frank i never have been the entir order system is complet screw up you walk up and order and then you are suppos to stand there and wait for them to cook your burger while peopl tri to pass in front and back of you to get their food that is done befor your  this is also the same place where the refil are so you have to maneuv around the condiment tabl and through the line to get a drink refil 

the condiment stand is a haven for germ last time i was in i saw a dude sneez and then use his finger to grab pickl geeerooo i went pickleless that visit

i gave you anoth chanc boa and while you boast of fresh qualiti ingredi you dont deliv on qualiti food or realist price sad i wont be backi have enjoy some tasti food here in the past but i wont be step foot in here again  one of their bouncer who refer to himself as g decid that it would be complet accept to let some transphob word escap his mouth  now in no way am i a transgend individu but i do have much respect for the tran communiti and i cant believ this place would keep this dude around  

so my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line so she peek around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guy bathroom and this dude just come at her all aggress like tell her she need to get away and all thatwhich she was quick to move and apolog  but then she ask him what if i was a transgend person to which this guy repli well then you can get out  realli dude  so she inform the manag of this and he was on her side for sure  the bouncer then began harass her again and was tri to kick her out of the bar for what righth didnt say and she call to the manag that he was still be aggress with her  the three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was tri to say that she call him the n wordum my girlfriend is black too jackass  she never use that word and would never call someon that becaus she actual is a respect person and isnt ignor  did the manag say anyth to the bouncer about his transphob comment  did he no i later call to ask what the manag name was and found out that not onli is gavin a manag but hes also part owneryouv got to be kid me

it a real shame when you let your employe harass a guest who didnt do anyth but tri to go pee  yelp folk whether your gay straight bi queer tran a straight alli or someth of the like i strong urg you to steer clear of this establish and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerword cannot even express how much i hate this place it liter five minut from my hous in temp and everybodi and their mother love it here ive been here four time four chanc and they blew everi singl one

visit 4 tonight i went with a girlfriend for drink after a run i onli went becaus it was a beauti night and i want to sit outdoor first off we had my friend dog with us and went to the front without the dog to see if we could tie him up outsid of the establish around a tree nobodi was there so we went back to get the dog to tie him up again outsid of the place by the sidewalk a man prompt and rude said im not let you two in with that dog out there okay so we took the dog back to the car and left the window down for him when we got back and found a seat i smile and said hello to our server when he greet us upon ask us what we want to drink i said there is a drink at boulder bar down the street i realli like and was wonder if you guy might do someth similar we dont he said and just look at us that it i proceed to tell him what the drink was strongbow mix with a raspberri type beer no i told you we dont final after awkward flounder about my friend and i settl on anoth drink we did get what we order and it was good we both got strongbow with a shot of firebal but serious deal with two rude men tonight plus the histori ive had there make me realiz i realli will never go back ever and i mean it this time

i mean truli i am extrem polit and go abov and beyond to make peopl feel comfort and happi to be serv me i smile big say hello dont take too much of their time dont whine or complain etc but the fact that four of my all time worst restaur experi were all from casey moor is just too much to ignor i hate that place and hate that im the onli one who feel this wayhorribl  

i was sick for two day after eat here 

i was so sad becaus i love joe crab shack in oklahoma citi  the decor is the onli thing this place had in common with it  the food was bland and i miss two day of work from eat iti will never return to this restaur  i have seen the commerci and decid to tri the place out  1st thing that i notic was that everi plate is 12 full with fri andor fri onion  i love fri and fri onion but when im pay around 1720 a plate the fri had better come on an extra plate  i felt like the food was mediocr for the expens price

i decid to return again and order the crab cake big mistak  the thing smell and tast rancid and im not use that term figur  they exchang them for some fire shrimp but the damag had been done  again the price were way too much for below par food and the amount of plate filler is unacceptable

to top it off both time i was there the place seem to have staff main teenag stand around chat but no one is do ani work  bad food high price and poor servic pretti much sum up this gem  if your in the mood for seafood i would strong recommend against this placeim sorri carmen but you are get a one star review 

i should have known as soon as i walk in this was not the sort of place to eat at should have just belli up to the bar instead of order food but we were starv the eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extrem over fri there we were pool of greas on the plate that they tri to mask by cover it with sauc and chees nice tri but you still could tast the overus deep fri oil remnants

th drink were weak veri weak

th canoli had the same deep fri stale tast and it was fill with cream that resembl the consist of toothpaste

th meal was one of the worst i have had in age hand down i will not be returndo not i repeat do not wast your time with this restaur  this restaur deserv no stars

foolish and uncharacterist i did not check yelp becaus my wife said she had been here in the past and it was fine  she obvious blot it from her mind as a horribl traumat experience

when we walk in we didnt need to be seat becaus there was onli one other coupl in the restaur the first bad sign the second was there was not a server in sight  after about 5 minut a sever did appear from the back somewher  she ask for our drink order and i told her we were readi to order our dinner also my wife order lasagn which was an earli bird special  bad sign 3  the waitress ask her if she want the lunch or dinner portion it was 630pm  my wife repli that she want the earli bird special  the waitress grab the menu to examin it state that she wasnt familiar with it becaus she was just here temporarili  i order the chicken cacciator and ice tea

bad sign 4  the waitress brought my ice tea what could be wrong with ice tea it was the foulest most undrink concoct i ever attempt to drink  when the waitress came by i told her the ice tea was undrink  to bring me a diet coke she came back short with a glass of regular coke becaus they didnt carri diet  i said fine  short thereaft an older man came out and said he heard that my tea wasnt good so he would bring me a fresh one  he brought me the fresh one  i didnt think it was possibl but it tast wors than the first one

th salad came and they were ok  they had fresh leaf lettuc with tomato and onion but the italian dress tast like wishbon thank god they didnt make it themselves

now for the entre  i wont go into ani detail but suffic it to say if taco bell  jack in the box made lasagn and chicken cacciator i would eat it there befor id set foot in this restaur  by the way i havent been to either of those place in the past 20 years

mi wife and i agre this was the worst restaur we have ever eaten in and im talk about liter thousand of restaur meal  i cannot fathom how this restaur is still in existence

i have definit learn my lesson  i will never ever forget to check yelp befor i go to a new restaur for fear that i might have blot this nightmar out of my mind as my wife obvious didrude waitress dri pizza must order beer and wine to make pizza tast better yea she liter aid that after we were get our check and she ask how it was we said decent i suppos not want to be rude

oh well this place is overpr and not veri goodmy wife and i went to tom one time and one time onli  we tri their hot link and rib tip platter  the first thing we were both horrifi over was the thick of the rib tip  credit card thin was the best descriptor  rib tip from the place i rememb back in chicago were much thicker than this and had waaaaaaaaaaaay more meat  

the hot link realli look and tast more like spici hot dog instead of italian sausag  the sauc definit left a lot to be desir  the aftertast had me grab my drink faster than a porsch 911 turbo on nitrous get from 060  

after the first bite my wife and i toss the stuff in the garbag and vow never to come back to this place becaus they have absolut no idea how to do chicago style bbq properso i went in think they actual make these thing from scratch which 99 of the time mean real ingredi 
i look at the croissant and they look unappet the decript sound good but the didnt look flakey or anyth 
which was a sign of hydrogen oil for some reason it weigh croissant down and is not onli wors for you than satur fat it make them tast like shit 

i ask the woman if there was partial hydrogen oil in ani of the food or margairin which has tran fat she went and get the 13 yr old baker 

who told me they dont make the ice which has partial hydrogen oil 
wtf whi would i just go to the groceri store if i didnt care about the oil i could get 7 unfresh pasteri for this price
th make there shit from a mix and have premad ice 
that is literrali the dumbest thing i have heard of  i am definet send them an email becaus if they dont even make there food than there is actual no pointweve visit p croissant over the past few month sever time the food here is pretti good the fill croissant were tasti with a bit of fill i went becaus someon in one of my class work there and brought some to a group meet onc and they were pretti good i would have like to be abl to get one without all that icing

if you call ahead they can make special request like flavor combo not on the menu or no ice so there is that servic from the colleg age kid who work there is general fast and veri friend occasion a littl scatterbrain they are quick to correct mistak and do what they can to make thing right though

howev the new manag suck rude and unpleas to deal with  all the genuin friend albeit ditzi colleg kid who use to work here are gone ive heard enough about their question food handl practic cook egg in plastic use old ingredi etc from the employe themselv to not want to come back 

ultim it too expens for what it is which is a fanci up frozen croissant if you notic the owner comment all throughout the yelp review youll notic they never onc say the croissant are made from scratch and the employe themselv have admit this if you ask them in person appar the other bake good like the scone muffin etc are from scratch but the croissant themselv are not  lame p croissant lameyes abu j i will elabor just for you

6 burger fail  you probabl cost 35¢ to make and you were cold
soggi french fri fail  how do you f up fri srsly
sprit lack co2 fail  it is not hard to reattach a new tank
custom servic fail   i dont appreci be scowl at while hand over money

and honest i never like this place it crap imodo we have a complet lack of intellig here it not rocket science

i was total unimpress with this locat but i did end up with a great funni stori to retel over and over math is not the strength of our futur youth that work here tri to explain twice and still got no where

i hope you have better luck and mayb better review of this divefirst off  i have never gotten out of that restaur without pay at least 30 with a famili of four  around 80 not includ drink the food is okay if you like a slice of pizza that is main made up of sauc and bread with bare ani chees or toppingsso much sauc  it was like soup then to top off the crappi food was the staff it is 100 degre outsid and they had a problem with us wear short and flip flop but hey they still let us in mayb the reason our food was crappi was becaus they didnt like our cloth until thing chang  i wont be wast ani more money here

i suggest that if this restaur want to surviv  they need to re think their menu  and straighten up the employe attitud  big time

and to everyon els who put more than 3 star on your review  either you dont have tastebud  or you got paid to do your reviewthis is the first review we have ever written  the experi we had was the worst we ever had and felt it was need to inform other at least as a warn  yesterday we were wait for la piazza if that is how it is spelt to open for dinner and we were starv  so we cross the street to have a littl appet  we order chicken wing  

the discomfort set in when we watch the kid behind the counter place the wing that look like they were cook yesterday into an oven to warm them  they were in there abour 4 minut when he remov them went into the back and came out a minut later with sauc on them  i thought mayb they just prep them in the morn and store them well so get them readi when they are order is a littl faster  im actual ok with that  we took our first bite and realiz it need to exit our mouth quick the bit and spit into a napkin happen in sync  the chicken was not onli cold in the middl and burn on the outsid  it was the textur and same moistur level of old jerki  im not kid that these wing had to have been cook at least 48 hour earlier than they were serv and left out on the side walk to dehydr  im not just say that it was dri chicken  this explan is not exager  i dont litter think it was left on the side walk but the chicken resembl what it would be if it had 

we were so disturb we left after explain the horror to the kid behind the counter and refus our refund just to leav as soon as possibl  

worst ever  negat 1000 star im think of call who ever need to be call when a restaur is serv harm foodhung a loon is what is should be call 

i tri this place when i bought my hous i was move tire and hungri an interest littl man came to the door he was car with him a menu to the hing loon it had pretti pictur of the fabul feast that would await i ask about the food and was assur it was delici 

so i proceed to call and speak to a woman who did not understand english veri well not uncommon for a mom and pop chines joint after repeat my order sever time and feel confid that she had it down 
i sat back and wait for beef chop suey teriyaki chicken an egg roll and free crab puff the special on the menu to be deliv 45 minut later it arriv and smell great i figur sinc i live 12 a mile from this place that 45 minut could mean they are veri busi or just veri slow after tast the food i believ it was the latter of the two 

1st both dish were swim in sauc almost like soup the chop suey tout brown oyster sauc it was white and it frighten me a littl i took the first bite and could not allow my stomach to be subject to this kind of crime i prompt spit it into my napkin 

the teriyaki chicken was veri fatti and had a funni tast it was rubberi like that of an old bird egg roll i think not greas stick my favorit was crab puff you bite in and get a puff of air not the creami chees and crab as intend for a crab puff to be 

dont do it for the love of god and all that is holi i beg you do not punish your tast bud with this garbag serv in cute togo containrealli what exact are they famous for

aft live in glendal for about 5 year see peopl drive around with pete bumper sticker and detour around 55th and glendal at rush hour becaus the drivethrough line back up into the road we final tri this in the end i just have to ask what all of their fan are thinking

th fish that so famous look and tast like someth you might get from the frozen food section of the store but onli if you got the cheapest store brand possibl and made sure it was a squar patti of frozen bread fish the fish sandwich was one of the aforement fish patti on a cheapo hamburg bun with a smear of sauc the fri were question honest id rather eat fish at long john silver than eat here againgross my roomat brought this home one night i would never recommend peter to anyone

it is cheap and discust parent who feed their children this should be jail for child abusthis review is for their annual luau

i have not eaten at this establish on a normal night and can not comment on that

sooo the luau
it was disorgan  the food was brought out buffet style and hundr of peopl rush the tabl lead to a gigant and veri slow move line

bi the time we made it up to the food tabl everyth was pick through and look like a tornado went through it

drink were not includ bu tthey did have cheap and tasti mai tais

for the food we got to eat i wasnt too impress  
the beef rib were way to fatty
th pork was so fatti i found the section i was given to be inedible
th corn on the cob was my favorit part

so i spent around 40 to eat two ear of corn and a few drinks

l sigh
mor organ and better food is need for this event
i demand itthis place live on it reput as a steeler bar alon  order the primanti brother knockoff  look and tast like wonder bread texa toast and steakum  the servic was even wors  i wont be backit a shame my experi suck but to be honest we didnt come dure ani event at the restaur and we came in a larg group also i didnt choos to eat here we were here for a celebration

no one sat us we arrang tabl ourselv outsid a waiter eventu came 10 minut later to get our drink orders

pric for the food are too high especi sinc the qualiti is bad i had the bbq burger and there was a dot of barbecu sauc imprint in the bun none on the burger the saute onion sat in a pool of greas on top of the burger the sweet potato waffl fri 2 extra were soak in oil so bad that it took 23 napkin just to soak up some of the greas off of one piec i ate the burger becaus i was veri hungri but it wasnt ani good my friend order chicken finger and for 8 she got 4 measlylook piec 

i dont know where all the good review are come from mayb they have good band play or good drink that i dont know about but the food is absolut terriblok im not some elitist snob that onli dine out in 5 star establish and though i do have an educ palat im also a realist when it come to the type of place where im dine 

that said i accept that im now go to be known as the offici curmudgeon of yelp but i cant help but believ in the concept of servic and qualiti in exchang for fair compens 

unfortun it a total unknown or ignor concept here 

come on realli five buck for a corona this is az peopl not nyc 

combin with the famous rib that serious would not place in my top fifti and a sour face waitress that clear didnt give a s if we were happi this has to top our list of dine ripoff you could offer me 500 buck to eat here and id pick the cafeteria at my old high school instead 

if this place were anywher but cave creek where peopl obvious have money to piss away they wouldnt surviv 

wish i could rate 0 stari give up

a friend suggest meet here for lunch this week i reluct said yes we were the first one in we went to the right and up the few step to find a tabl everyon had dirti chair and tabl with crumb obvious from the night befor if i was desper there might have been enough food around to make a meal

aft look at each other we decid to tri one of the high top down in the bar area ok the chair were clean and the tabl top look clean so we sat sinc there were two of us at a four place i went to move the salt and pepper out of the way not an easi chore sinc the salt was stuck to the tabl break it loos and move on to move the small appet plate they were stack for four

th top three slide off the bottom one stuck to the tabl the tabl had that sticki someon almost tri to clean it off feel to it

to the waitress credit after mention the upper chair and tabl she got a towel and went to clean them off after tell us it must have been the night crew mistak  well duh

again there no manag at this place if they would clean up improv the inconsist food and get it togeth they might do more biz mayb they need to call in restaur imposs or just ask their custom we could all tell them a few thing those of us that care

a a note it was my friend first time there want to tri it she said shed never be back  mayb my standard for cleanli and good food are higher than some other but i alway tell it like i see it 

i give up im done with this holeive creat a new award the want award for worst of ani given thing  you know the movi with angelina where you could fling your wrist while shoot a gun and the bullet would somehow curv in midair  you rememb  the movi with onc respect actor take inform from a giant loom that wove the fabric of time  get it

wel the first want award is in the restaur categori  applaus for top shelf the absolut worst restaur ive ever eaten at  on the menu you can choos from nacho that tast like cardboard taco stuf with fill straight from the paper shredder burrito made out of someth a bum would live in and enchilada that fill your mouth with the familiar flavor of kleenex

i hate to be mean  but sinc i have a duti to anyon who read this to dissemin truth i have to just tell you that you should never go there  if anyon want to bring you there you should go all gandhi on them and start a hunger strike  trust mecame upon this place while i was at the farmer market across the way so after some shop done we came in here for lunch  the place is pretti tini but had room enough for a few booth and dine tabl it was busi but we were greet and seat right away by a realli nice guy when we step insid   our server on the other hand was someth els  i ask what i thought was an innoc question what type of mole sauc did they serv with their dish  most server i have ask usual would know and had no problem answer with either mole poblano mole negro etc but this person just cop a tude threw up her hand and said it mole sauc like duh mole sauc you idiot  i was go to rephras my question then and ask what ingredi was in their mole sauc when the guy who seat us was about to pipe in and help the server out but she held her arm out and just continu on and snap at me and said red sauc is red sauc   at that point i look at mr b and said im outta here i thank her got up and we left the guy who seat us gave us an apologet look i felt bad but there was no way i was go to have lunch there after that  hey well at least i know that their mole sauc is redi have been eat at this villa pizza for over 14 year they recent reloc the owner have alway been nice peopl and even though the pizza is a littl over price i enjoy it when you pay 
40 for a larg chees pizza and 15 finger you expect them to be good ive never had an issu until today i order deliveri from this villa chees pizza and fingershot it took almost 50 minut to get here which was finebut when it got here the pizza was bare warm and the finger look like they had bare drizzl hot sauc on them usual they come dous in the sauc and they are hot and fresh i was realli upset consid i also tip 6 to the driver sinc ive been a patron of their for year i decid to call and let them know my dissatisfact the owner wife answer the phone i explain to her the situat in a calm manner she said that they took the pizza right out of the oven and deliv it which could possibl be true i am sure they deliv sever order on the way to mine she also state that their chicken soak up the sauc ive order this exact meal sever time and never had it in that condit when i explain it to her she got fluster and hand the phone to her husband he then proceed to yell at me and tell me that i was wrong i was extrem offend and told him that i have order from them for 14 year he said he would send me a fix order i told him it was not necessari but that i just want him to acknowledg that it was poor he said he was send a fix order and that i didnt need to order from him ever again 
i was complet offend i could not believ that after eat there and order food to go for over 14 year that i would be treat so poor i can honest say i will never order from them again as i refus to support ani busi small or larg that would yell at custom like that i am afraid to eat what they brought to replac the order as i fear it could be compromis i am so disappoint to say the least that ani busi would treat custom that way i will never eat or order from this villa pizza againthis restaur rate 1 on the worst chines fast food list in the countri i have live in mani place and in mani state and this restaur is the worst 

we order crab rangoon  general tso chicken the crab rangoon was veri small overcook and had a smear of who know what in it the general tso chicken had someth that resembl paint thinner and smell like it too the chicken was the cheapest qualiti a restaur could buy for fear of spend the weekend in the hospit i stuck to the overcook crab rangoon and some rice i was desperate

if you have the iron stomach and complet lack of tast bud to tri the food here you might want to avoid the duck sauc that was nastier than the paint thinner er the chickenit is realli sad to give this place a one star  i was realli excit to have an einstein near my hous and i have been to two other locat of einstein bagel and this is the onli locat that is complet horribl  

the peopl here a are complet rude and unprofession when i order the person that was take my order just ask what do you wantthat itgo over there  he seem so unhappi and hate life  

now i go on to the second regist to pay  i believ he was the manag of this einstein locat and surpris he look unhappi too  sigh i went to pay and i am sure he heard me say wow the peopl that work here are so rude  

i took a bite of my chocol chip bagel with regular smear  it was overfil with  cream chees and my bagel is burnt sigh shake my head 

i hope one day i can updat my review and give it a better rate  as for now one star is what they will getwhi has it taken me so long to eat at el sombrero i told the owner while eat there that i cant believ i am from las vega we wont get into how mani decad tee hee and have never eaten here well i think i was more into the histor mean and longest run mexican restaur i set the bar too high i did howev give a tri to this mom  pop establish the woman who said she was the owner theresa was actual rude she made comment i couldnt believ a littl girl was call her name to tell her good by and to thank her for the food and she ignor her onli final to tell her im busi not now i was heartbroken for the littl girl 

the place is veri small insid they have booth along the wall and tabl in the middl i would recommend call befor head down becaus they arent open everi night in fact they are open night on friday and saturday and it is just until 9 pm 

we start with a chees quesadilla so simpl yet so overpriced
sh also brought us some chip and 2 kind of salsa i have to admit the salsa wasnt the best i order a combo platter that had a chees enchilada with onion and a guacamol tostada which also came with the normal bean and rice these bean werent normal though they are thick not runni and i would like that if they just had soe flavor i ask for my enchilada to be made with a flour tortilla and it was big and veri yummi the guacamol was not fresh and frozen i dont know if that is a regular thing or if she was out of avocado gross the other 2 in my group enjoy there meal too but agre the salsa and rice could use some help the rice seem like it was leftov and reheat veri dry

w cap the night off with some sopapilla and honey this by far was the best part of the night 

meal rang from 10 and up they have a beer and wine liquor licens so if you order a margarita it will be made with wine

i dont plan on visit here again anytim soon this is note as the oldest mexican restaur in vega there are certain tabl that have reserv on them for local lawyer such as richard harri and a few other who escap up to 3 time a week from their downtown offic to have some lunch or even conduct a busi meetmy friend karen had seen this restaur and had made mental note that she want to give it a shot 

we decid this is where we would do dinner last night befor hit up the western for 1 shot and beer and then to dino for karaok 

wow where do i start 

wait about 15 minut until we were final approach for a drink order let alon question regard the menu i had never had cuban food at a restaur so i was a bit clueless on what certain thing were 

i ask the waitress what the hous specialti is or what is order the most and or popular she then point out a few thing on the menu and say this is ok um that is ok well you know what ladi i am look for more than just ok 

crappi servic for starter after final come to take our order it took anoth 15 minut or so to get our drink the food took forev and onli two of four meal were brought so i am sit wait until my friend food come so i can eat i said screw it my fajita are get cold wait so i dug in 

after the non help suggest from the waitress i decid to play it safe and order the beef and chicken fajita which came with a side plate of rice and bean the fajita were a larg portion of dri unseason chicken and beef not much flavor at all to speak of i have had better fajita at el torito disappoint for me as even the rice and bean were bland veri bland 

friend 1 order a bowl of menudo she said the flavor was not the best and she is an old school menudo eater she ask the waitress prior if it their menudo had a red or white base the waitress pull the menu and point to the pictur and said that is what it look like also her plate was a sloppi mess when it arriv menudo juic all over the plate and run down the side of the bowl the present was just bad i know they were rush to get order out but there is just no excus for that slop to be drop at anyon tabl i attach a pictur check it out

friend 2 got the tequila pollo dish with a side order of chile releno the chicken was one big slab on the plate would have made a better eater friend and a visual appeal meal had they slice it the portion was generous but did not matter as the tast onc again was bland as the other dish we tri 

friend 3 got some sort of beef dish that was noth but grizzl all she was abl to eat was the white rice and the black bean she spit up liter had a plate of wast meat left she probabl should have sent it back as was basic ined the servic was slow and not veri friend did not seem like a good outcom if a complaint was issu i think that is the vibe we felt still i would have issu my complaint as they can not improv someth if they are not awar or get the complaint 

servic and food veri disappoint 

the tab was 8000 for four of us for bad servic and plain unflavor food we will not be back 

also the flat screen tv blast the michael jackson video over and over and over and over and over was overkil we could not hear each other so we had veri littl convers between the four of us 

a hilari moment the waitress walk past our tabl and becaus the music video was soooooo freakin loud the waitress did not even hear my friend call her we just want to ask if they could turn it down sever other patron were talk about it as well ok they were not talk about it as i could not hear anyon i mean i was lip read along with watch peopl point to their ear so i am assum they were think the same as we were that the music was way too loud dont get me wrongmus is my life but when i dine i am not realli down for a tape concert at the same time it was ridicul how loud it was

thi place suck ballsand not the good kind 

this place just gave reason for a bitch fest that night from my friend and they are not even yelper i never want to endur that again

they should also train their employe on cuban food not cool for a specialti restaur to have staff that is clueless in regard to the menu

servic suck 
poor food 
priceylast and final visit

wow ok so i am done with red shrimp co for awhil or at least until i forget how bad my last two visit have been 

mi first visit 4 star 
mi second visit 3 star 
mi third and last visit 2 star 

what a bummer 

we went for lunch today i order the spici shrimp lunch special ugh forgot how terribl their rice is and forgot to order the substitut lo mein instead for 125 more 

the spici shrimp was ok but again had that thick non tradit sauc from a can that is just pure fake chines tast 

not a happi camper 

mi littl sister order mongolian beef which was ok but there must have been one whole onion cut up in it and the ratio to meat was beyond ridicul 

as i was watch my sister struggl with the insan amount of onion i took her plate and ask the ladi if she could assist me with the remov of half of the onion as there was not realli ani meat after all the dish is call mongolian beef not mongolian onion 

i understand for health reason i am sure she could not take it back behind the counter but to tell me that there is a trash can behind me and i can do it there was kind of odd so much for that 

i gave my sister her plate back and she just pick the remain few piec of meat out and left the pile of onion stack to the side 

the crab rangoon were a joke just dough with some cream chees fri no trace of crab as in crab rangoon 

that it no more this was the final and last roll of the dice not go to wast my hard earn money on such poor food and qualiti 

on had one visit that was good as describ in my first review they are not consist here and that speak volum 

done done done with below standard food and funki shitti bad attitud fill servic 

i gave this place two chanc and they fail me i was more than fair

pic attach look are deceiv1 star for this rainbowtropicana locat 

servic was horribleth cashier was slam the cashier drawer as if she was piss off at the world and had a perman frown on her face as if she were smell burn hair from her upper lip

i am not a fan of their cheap bland and flavorless pizza in the first place i onli come here at the request of my babi sister 26 who happen to like their pizza ugh 

next time i will put my foot down and say hell no to littl skeezer 

i am through with this locationdon done done enough said 

to the crew at this locat you can all go to hell you all have a bad attitud everi singl time yes it is clear you hate your job dont make me suffer for your employ decisions

bit meservic is nonexist rude if ani and racial discriminatori basic if you do not look chines or are not chines the peopl who work here are extrem rude

mi husband 12 chines 12 swedish and i 100 chines came here with our son 1 year old for an earli dim sum lunch we have been come to chang sinc 2004 but the restaur is now under new ownership we experienc the worst actual it was non exist servic the hostess was rude when she seat us she brought over 2 fork ignor me when i said we do not need them and then slam them onto our plate and walk away

when we complain to the manag he told us the restaur worker bring fork to american this in itself is racial discriminationprofil serious who doesnt know how to use chop stick do japanes restaur bring american fork do italian restaur bring asian custom chop stick 

when it came time to pay our bill the same hostess who seat us point blank ignor our rais bill in the air and purpos did not take it at this point my husband walk over to her and tap her on the back to give her the bill she continu to ignor him and refus to turn around he tap her again with the bill in his had and she again ignor him when she final turn she look at the bill in his hand and refus to take it let it drop to the floor when he hand it to her at this point anoth restaur employe came over and ask whi the hostess did not take the bill the hostess walk away and act like it was not her job when the other restaur employe pick up the bill and came over to our tabl i ask her if the hostess is respons for take bill and ring them up she respond yes

when we complain to the owner of the restaur he said my husband should not have tap the hostess on the back uuuuummm realli how els am i suppos to get a worker attent so they can do their job instead of be apologet or recogn the blatant discrimin the owner and the manag of the restaur blame us the custom for be a problem 

i will never come to this restaur again and believ what come around goe around the food is mediocr at best and the servic doe not exist we are from san francisco and have never been treat in such a manner at ani chines or asian restauri have eaten at this restaur about a dozen time and alway been impress by their food but sad neglect to review it dure the good time  fortun at the time my companion made it a point to post posit review of the restaur  so when i had relat visit from out of town look for a late night meal i proud recommend ferraro 

the restaur could not possibl have made me look wors than with the sad event earlier tonight  the back patio  normal quiet and sane  was book for a privat parti and it was loud and rock  no problem by itself but i wonder if it left the dine room understaffed

not to belabor the detail but the meal we were serv would have been terribl by oliv garden standard  each of our three entre were serv cold youd have to heat them a few degre to get to lukewarm and were most ined  the fact that all three of us left 80 of our meal untouch was clear lost on the busboy who was surpris that none of us request a doggi bag  after wait 45 minut for our food to arriv none of us was in the mood to even consid a reorder even if it had been offer  which it import to note it was not  our waitress simpli drop off our check and rush off to the next table

i dont know if ani of this was becaus the kitchen was overwhelm or if the one lone waitress in the dine room didnt bring them out quick enough  and quit frank i dont care

it may have been just anoth day on their schedul and  oop  they mess up dure a prebook parti but it was a veri import event in my life and that meal was simpli unaccept  

certain by my previous experi and by the review of other on this page your odd favor a good experi  but i like to leav my gambl at the tabl and  now that this restaur is clear not a sure thing  take my busi elsewhere

oh yes shame on you ferraro  when you stop care about one custom how long befor you stop care about them all  keep offer 12 off deal for local and then treat us like crap it a guarante longterm recip for failurno thank you we will never go back
th servic was horribl we were the onli tabl in the bar with 6 sever but yet we were ignor by all of them strang if you ask me our food was ok i order the spaghetti with light tomato sauc and ricotta chees on top sound great but when it came out it was all cold  and my husband spaghetti and meatbal were so hot he couldnt eat for about 10 min which i guess is better than be cold along with that our sever got mad at us becaus we didnt order wine it was overal a bad experi fart face appar i cant eat a shitti meal without be the subject of pointless ridicul mayb if i was as high off of my own ego as one review let call her dog shit i wouldv enjoy the charcoal briquett tri to pass as lamb kabob ds recommend or the oil pouch masquerad as the tradit fri eggplant app ive had at mani med eateriesmayb ingenu was the wrong word  flavor was suffici  but wtf is that what this spat is about word choic rebelli iconoclast is redund but i dont get my rock off on scrutin sloppi diction on a fuck food review websit ds is defens bc i had a bad meal at a restaur she like bfd this is about the food not you ds it alway about the food i could give two shit about what you or your cadr of asskiss lem who drool over everi sat word and spunki madeup phrase popul your review think about kabob palac i just want tasti food mayb it was an off night  who know but unless your pay im not go back

so let just boil this shit down to it essenc the food i ate suck get over itthis walli world suck ass howev is close to my home so i of cours come here to shop for my odd ball random stuff that we need 

the staff is alway miser typic over work employe make veri low wage do the work of three peopl it is a shame that i have shop at this locat for over 3 year now and have never encount a smile or happi and help employee

top 5 worst restaur experi 

for a littl buddha the manag had a big napoleon complex i was a victim of that waterdog larg parti massacr 18 peopl took taxi from the wynn when we arriv the restaur was 12 empti and the manag decid to split up the group he was a tripl threat  a total liar bad attitud and wors breath when i told him i would yelp about our experi  he said dont threaten me

no threat here  there are too mani good restaur in vega save your money and your taxi fareguy fieri owe me a huge apolog he owe everyon an apolog he is an ahol and this place is the worst restaur  bar i have ever been to it not that it is a dive i like dive it is a sht hole the fact that you have to be buzz in after midnight doesnt bother me the disgust food and poor servic bother me

th bartend will not take your food order he has to call in some senil toothless woman to take your order she will come back to you sever time ask you what you order as she didnt rememb then she serv it in styrofoam contain she should have just thrown the crap away befor she gave it to me the stromboli is disgust the whole thing is disgust if you want to clean up vega start here and shut this place downwow how dare this place have the nerv to call themselv a philli chees steak place 

i would never ever ever ever ever go back here 

yuck 

there philli steak are tasteless it like eat bread fill with wood horribl i was so piss off becaus by drive by it look like a place that would have great food and it alway busi so i decid to tri this place i felt rip off it was way over price for lousi food 

pleas pleas pleas do not eat here if you like good food especi if your use to tradit philli steakin the worst of time peopl often think of the best of time  rex is no except  gather around kid and let uncl rex tell you a storywhen rex was a small child he spent mani a month on the east coast it was a magic time  my father who beat young rex merciless if rex call him anyth but the futur husband of the multi talent pia zadora was origin from the northeast  my father was an odd man a brutal man a man with big dream and small child like hand  on my fifth birthday he brought rex with him as he knock over a 711  as rex help him tie up the store clerk he let me pick ani one thing rex want in the store  young rex wander around the store tri veri hard to not step in the pool of blood rex saw the object he wantedrex turn and said futur husband of the multi talent pia zadora can rex have that  he nod  rex kick the 87 year old man lay on some of itand pick it up it was a bag with a delici cheesesteak in it  rex danc rex smile rex took the wallet of a cri soccer dad  rex was happi  rex and futur husband of the multi talent pia zadora drove down the street the sound of siren in the distanc fadingth smell of the cheesesteak waft into rex young nasal passag  a great cheesesteak is a gift from abov  a wallet fill with 20 dollar bill and an unus condom on the cake  after we divid the ill gotten booti futur husband of the multi talent pia zadora alway took 70 until i turn 9but that is anoth storyrex ate his cheesesteak  perfect bread juici shred meat perfect cook onion the right amount of whiz juic ran down rex chin juic ran down rex hand rex shook in delight that memori and the 8 month rex spent on the run after futur husband of the multi talent pia zadora rat him outwil alway be with him

pop philli cheesesteak is not onli an insult to that memori it is an insult to all thing with meat chees bread or even hot food  the front page of the their websit has a pictur of their piti attempt of a cheeesteakon of one of their abomin has green pepper on it green pepper  let me explain someth to all of you who are not from phillyif there was a place in philadelphia that put green bell pepper on their cheeseteakth citizen would burn it down  it is absolutley 100 not allow in ani place in philadelphia even if ask they will not do it  so first and foremost this is not a philli cheesesteak place it is not end of story

apolog rex pass out and need a shot of happi serum to get up right againwhat is happi serum you askheathenit is 1 part gasolin 1 part peach schnapp 1 part wiper fluid 

anyway now that we have establish this is not a philli cheesesteak let talk about it from a cheesesteak on it own merit  first the roll are good the sad part is you can tell the bread is ship frozen or frozen after it get to pop  big mistak it realli mess with the bread it isnt bad but again it isnt east coast good  cheesenev enough never if you get provolon instead of whiz it is almost nonexist shame on you for skimp on the chees  the whiz isnt bad sometim but more often than not there isnt enough  the meat isnt bad it is done well with one big problemit is often dri not enough oil or cook and then recook whatev the reason it is not great  if you get to pop on the right day and get lucki and order correct it isnt badbut the overal consist is not there

lastlyth philli part of the menuth tastycak the birch beer the rest of ital way too expens at glazier market you can get all the stuff for 15th of the price  

here is my biggest problempop play on east coast memori and local who dont know ani better that is the biggest crime it isnt philli it isnt a great cheesesteak it is over price it is inconsist it just isnt right it just isnt good  most of you will never know better unless you go back east and my next review for pizza will tell you how to find great east coast food and they know you dont know pop has been a place i have tri off and on for almost 8 year  rex want to love it rex need to keep tri everi 2 year or sobut much like when his father turn him into the cop at the tender age of 5rex is alway hurt by pop futur husband of the multi talent pia zadora and popssham on youyou know better rex know better rex deserv better so doe everyon elsmy partner is suffer from food poison right now as i write this review  thank alot firefli  we assum it from the chicken skewer or an appl salad  these are the onli thing i didnt tri of his thank god  we ate around 8pm on 42511 he was throw up by 1130pm  it 221am now and hes still pray to the porcelain god  this is horribl and obvious we will never come back  i feel disgust and almost want to ask you for a fuck refund  we werent expect a side of salmonella or e coli with dinner tonight  also thank for ruin what was a great vacat thus fari dine with a friend visit from london  on 0422 from around 810pm

while first impress are import that is where the term for circo fine dine establish end first of all let go over the criteria of what make a restaur a fine dine establish in no particular order

location
ambiance
qu of food
service
price
reputation

circo is in the bellagio it relat to le cirqu it expens it look pretti i expect more was there an eleph sit in the middl of the room becaus the staff at circo pretend they didnt see it there is someth veri wrong about the restaur and it seem as if they dont care the food select is mediocr as well as what it actual tast like noth to jump out of your seat for no parti for your tast bud you wont rememb ani dish here as be 4 star circo be a restaur where peopl actual go to eat we have to set the food asid and focus on what make this place a bad place to spend your even and empti your wallet

th servic here is terribl first of all the waiter was deliv food to the tabl next to us and pour wine when he somehow jolt and pour wine down my friend back 

oh my sorri 
oh oh as we grab for our napkin to dri the excess liquid realli we are think what are you go to do about it 
sir we can have your shirt dri clean for you what is your room number
oh were not stay at this hotel
oh then we cant dri clean your shirt for you

wel gee you pour wine down my friend back ruin his shirt and you cant even get it dri clean becaus were not stay at the bellagio circo did noth to compens for this disast no curtesi appet no complimentari meal no offer to pick up the bill for dri clean els where noth the most embarrass to circo is that the love coupl next to us felt so bad they sent a veri fine bottl of wine to our tabl got up and apolog even though it was not their fault but the waiter circo doe not take respons for their action nor do they care about the qualiti of product they offer to their custom it a pitipleas read do not eat here

just for the record i have been work in the restaur industri for sever year from michelin rate to casual therefor i know good food and bad food when i see it

battista hole in the wall is the absolut worst restaur i have ever been to list below are all the reason why

1 the hostess all the hostess were cold and unfriend did not smile or welcom us when ask to be seat they told us we had to have our whole parti there understand for larg parti but we were a parti of 4 2 of us were there when ask to see a menu they hand us a paper menu with zero descript and when ask about the descript they inform us that our server would inform us

1 the server when seat the was extrem clueless he ask us sever time if we had ani question yet when we ask him question he did not know we ask him to explain the menu and he point to the menu on the wall and told us to look at it when ask what beer there were he told us all kind then onli mention 2 he was veri un attent and took forev to do anyth 

3 accord player as you enjoy complimentari soupsalad and bread gollum from the lord of the ring come to your tabl and tell you not ask to play your parti a song then he awkward stand there until you reluct reach into your pocketpurs to give him a tip 

4 the food the food was aw the dish are premad 25 meal which are extrem unappet liter they tast like tv dinner we had chicken alfredo chicken parmesan and beef ravioli everyon hate theyr dishes

5 cover charg consid i hate my meal i return it to the server assum he would take it off the check he did not onli after request it remov the check is return with a cover charg he did not tell us what this was and when ask he inform us that when someon doesnt order a dish a cover charg is done to cover the includ soupsaladbread in my case sinc i sent my dish back they decid to charg me 12 for their aw starter 
 
from start to finish i had the absolut worst experi i have ever had at a restaur and left hungri pleas do not wast your timemoney on this place i would give it no star if i could at this rate battista will sure go out of busithanksgiv trip to vega we didnt check in to the mont carlo until almost one in the morn and i was practic asleep but i knew i need to catch a second wind i head to the casino order a bloodi mari then went to go find food the pizza look old i didnt want mcdonald rubio fish taco did not sound appet at 100 am and the chicken place was closedchines it is

i got a one item combo plate with noth els for 9 i ask for half and half fri ricechow mein and i order their sesam chicken

th rice had zero flavor and was pretti old tast the chow mein also tast horribl and the consist of the noodl was gross and the chicken was so sweet it was liter like eat piec of candi i went back and got some soy sauc to tri to liven up the bland food but even soy sauc couldnt help it 

i gave up and ate some of my friend chicken mcnugget from mcdonald stay awayf this place

cut decor if you like disneyland version of things

pretti unexcit showmanship and culinari skill from the teppanyaki chefs

how about not flip dead shrimp into the plate of vegetarian benihana guy 

the food was remark blah  the salad  even the dress is better at your local sushi joint  the onion soup yech the steam rice pretti aw and there is an art to rice that benihana should have learn and final if i myself took some chicken saute it with butter and pour sesam seed over the top it would tast much better and cost way lest than the 4950 that my client had to pay

p if someon doesnt eat red meat can you pleas not put their chicken next to a bloodi piec of steak cook on the grill  could you perhap use a differ knife  the whole thing was gross

stay away it not that it bad it just not goodso far theyr onli succed in piss me off  im tri to plan a larg event here and have been email and call for two week with veri littl respons  
if you dont want my busi just say so and ill move on  mmmkaybeen go to the bbqbreweri for the past coupl year took my daughter and wife usual we get awesom servic cheap food and great beer not anymore

they now exclud all kid and have a mandatori 21 and over rule for ani guest can you say stupid as fk wtf from deal with the reduc hour to now thisbas the final straw and will not be go back anymorealso arriv at 9pm they close at 10pmhostess said we might not be abl to give you a seateven though there was at least 2 tabl free anoth wtfso basic if you have a kid and arriv 1 full hour befor close dont bother eat here and wast your time

today it just a relic of what use to be hot in 1970s vega  oh sure they boast of upgrad room on their websit  realli it just a chang in furnitur and new linen  that would be like your grandma get a boob job  her tit would look like they belong on a 20 year old but the rest of her would still be bust  old wrinkl and hella busted

so whi did i stay here you ask  good question  i was here for a confer and the room was prepaid  if i could do it all again i would have stay at the bellagio and commut down the strip everyday

the hallway smell of old cat litter box nasti 

the front desk peopl are rude and dont even let you speak  they just speak over you and tell you no

th whole place is old and need some serious renov  our room look like they tri to remodel at some point but it was more of slap some new stuff over the old stuffthis is by far the worst hotel i have ever stay at 

i bought a groupon for 78 and thought i was get a fabul deal the photo look like mayb they clean the place up a bit and the extra were cool 20 slot play 2 free welcom drink 2 ticket to the comedi show so i bought it 

i got into town on sunday at 4pm and was origin given a room at the north tower ummmwet spot on the carpet i didnt know if it was a blood stain piss or just a spill or mayb a pitcher of beer pubic hair plaster on the back of the bathroom door and the stench wow for it not be a nonsmok room it sure the hell smell like a dingi old bar when i attempt to take a shower the shower water didnt go down basic i was up to my ankl in vega sweat and the black sediment start come up from the drain

wa here recent for a pool tournament  the major pool leagu have their final here everi year  it work great for the pool tournament but for the touristvisitor it not a good properti  stay somewher els and play pool here dure those events

return factor  0worst hotel ever

if i could i would give it infinit negat star first off i wait in line for over 25 hour to regist for a room onli to be told that i have been reloc around the corner they wouldnt pay for a cab ride and that result in us have to walk to the place okay we got reloc to the mariott suitehil inn which was super nice but that is besid the point

th point is is that i wast a whole night in vega just becaus i had to wait to regist for a hotel room so dumb 

if i could i would give this place infinit negat star this place has forev earn a place in my mind as the worst hotel in the world and i will pass this on to all my friends

disgustthis hotel is an absolut dump  we got scam off of pricelin my wife was look for a 3 star hotel do name your own price  last time we did this we end up at treasur island on a weekend night for 60 out the door  she was up to 75 when it book us for this 1star turd   we had stay the previous night at a station casino aliunt and that was a modest 23 star place  when we enter the old run down park garag of the riviera i knew we were doom   

we check in and no one around us was speak english this is when i knew we were in for it  the lobbi was dirti and old  i understand this hotel is a vega classic but they could at least updat the carpet and paint everi 2030 year just so it doesnt feel as dirti   

we tri to call pricelin to cancel or at least chang the hotel they were will but the riviera refus to cancel our reserv on pricelin end  we were stuck and after tax and fee it was just short of 100 for the night  what made me even more furious was after get to our room i start check on rate and the averag onlin book was modest 3040 on averag per night  

the room was old smelli and noisi as all hell  you could hear cell phone ring in the room around you tvs blare peopl take a wiz repeat all through the night  the bed was as hard as a rock  between the bed and the nois i got about 15 minut of sleep total the entir night

so i felt like i should gambl onli becaus i want some of my damn room money back  huge mistak  the slot were tighter then zeuss butthol  i put near 200 into a vast array of machin and never even went into the black  i was so disappoint in this place i will forev forsak it and warn all my friend and famili to stay the hell away from the riviera  from the overpr 20 brunch buffet to the dirti room and dirti casino this hotel is onli for those who just didnt know ani better  avoid this disast at all cost i implor you

 quick updat 

got home from our trip and found the riviera hotel had charg us 130 as well as the pricelin prepaid reserv  i call the hotel and they say they dont have a record of the transact but they do see they bill us a resort fee of 15  at check in we were never told of ani addit fee associ with the room  we did a name your own price on pricelin  she told me that everi guest no matter how they book is charg a resort fee  the woman was extrem rude even though i was not even post  riviera the treatment and experi is aw   now im work with the bank to cancel the 130 charg and with pricelin to find out who should be pay this so call resort fee   ive been at mani a motel 6s that were more of a resort then the riviera  the pool wasnt even open when we were thereplace suck bewar book king size bed gave us two fullnot fun to have fun on
employe look depress bartend are old and unfriend the wallpap is peel and the room smell like rot fruit and old ladygrossthis was the worst confer site and hotel for a confer i enjoy attend annual first recommend if look at this site for a confer be awar that it has negat vibe for the kind of communiti feel one seek for that kind of event not conduc to social and network 
checkin veri long line and onli 2 clerk that remain true on multipl day the upgrad coupon were a come on fake 
in our hallway a glass sat for sever day not pick up by cater or clean staff 
that bathtub did not drain the room decor was fine the blare loudspeak from pool loudspeak seat are avail  at poker tabl were annoy both at room and poolsid definit go outsid hotel for ani meal which includ coffe at snack stand  while the price for a confer hotel may seem seduct at 70  much more is list in good will and negat feelthe dirtiest seediest and most  run down hotel i have ever stay at i had to stay here for a convent and was appal the room have been cosmet updat but the shower was mildewi and the room had an old wall ac unit that was loud ran constant and was probabl fill with mold i woke up with my allergi go insan final you know your in a seedi place when there is a hypoderm needl dispos in the bathroom wtf

the hotel host a confer for 3000 peopl but wasnt proper staf to handl it you had to wait at least 30 minut for the pleasur to eat at one of their disgust restaur all of the food i ate at the restaur was deep fri dreck im amaz i didnt get ill

th casino is old depress and attract a lot of creep at night they had a scantili clad girl danc on a pole just sad

it not even worth it to stay here on the cheap sinc it so far north on the strip you have to take an expens cab ride to get anywher other than circus circus which is just as seedi and gross the wynn is probabl the closest place at a 10 minut walk

bottom line this dive need to be condemnbed bug stay away we stay at the riviera hotel  casino for a profession confer and had one of the veri worst experi imagin we were bitten all over our leg and arm by bed bug and we were treat poor by hotel manag and secur after report the bite 

first listen to these onlin review mine isnt the onli bed bug incid our biggest mistak was that we ignor all of the mani warn befor book the hotel we ignor warn of bed bug from colleagu who refus to stay there we ignor yelp review warn custom of bed bug read them there ton and ignor warn about the riviera on the bed bug registri httpwwwbedbugregistrycomhotelnvlasvegasrivierahotel2526ampcasino

instead of make the smart decis we reason that it would be nice to stay at the hotel host our confer and that realli it couldnt be that bad bad decis 

we check in tuesday thursday night we discov bed bug bite on our feet leg and arm we googleimag search bed bug bite and read about the symptom they look exact like the pictur and match the symptom when we brought this to the attent of the hotel staff we receiv the complet runaround manag pass us off to secur who took pictur of all our bite on our feet arm and leg secur pass us off to risk manag who conveni were not in at that moment and then we were pass back to hotel manag and pass back to secur no one could give us ani answer but we were given a new room while they investig our old room a manag comp us 5000 but suggest that this comp doe not confirm fault by the hotel sound kind of fishi right 

when we check out we told the manag that we would not be pay for the room manag call secur who surround us threaten us and harass us they told me to wait 810 busi day befor call risk manag i wait 10 busi day and call today i was inform that the report came back as inconclus and that i would be respons for pay the room when i question their investig say that it was aw conveni that their investig found no evid of bed bug they hung up on me now the riviera is make me pay for my bedbuginfest room what a poor poor exampl of custom servic in a town where theyr basic give away hotel room to tri to get folk to stay and gambl they wouldnt even comp us a room after infest our bodi cloth and luggag with bed bug now that poor custom servic 

serious listen to the warn on yelp and other review site dont make the mistak of think that these are a few random bitter crank with an axe to grind this is a serious problem that the hotel appar has not address properi dont think i would return here i book through a travel site and thought it was a great deal until i got there and they told me i could onli have an old nonupd smoke room just so you know nonsmok is an upgrad you will pay for by the end of i spent more here than i would have at a nicer hotel the room were decent in the tower i upgrad to but it didnt feel like an upgrad so im terrifi to think what the other room are like 

do yourself a favor and book elsewherterribl  i have stay here a few time and my room was upgrad  to manaco tower  it what i pay for anyway and this time they screw up and did not give me the room i paid for they gave me a smokingi dont smoke and specif ask for no smoke and gave me in the old tower 
what can i say these room suck the new tower are ok but these are horrif mold in the bathroom bath tub is filthi and the mattress are extrem uncomfort i complain to manag  annett and she was rude and act like she doesnt care what kind of servic is that i mean i would get better servic at motel 6 im sure 
either way they lost a continu custom and will not ever return here even for a free room 
save yourself the troubl and do not stay heredo not come here worst hotelmotel ever 
horribl filthi worst custom servic ever casino has liter 20 machin no live dealer this has been the worst hotel experi ever in my life or should i say motel i arriv at riviera around 11pm to check in the valet guy was rude 

whatev i just want to get into my room get there the clerk said we didnt specifi which room my husband  i want so he would give us a smoke room with 2 queen bed i didnt want to get a smoke room so i was will to pay 20 buck to upgrad to a 1 king size bed  no smoke the clerk say ill upgrad you guy to the new tower  in his monoton voic btw so ani way we get up to our room i thought this was a joke it was worst than the local la quinta this is upgrad the room was humid the fridg was broken one of the lamp was also broken button was gone and the thing that got me the most was the half use shampoo bottl without a condition or hand soap to offer which is what normal hotel give you oh and there was also a dirti hand print on our tabl there was also a paper that say this room has been clean by and no one sign it lol hmmm

i am an easi go girl realli but this was outrag half use shampoo realli couldv refil it at least so i wouldnt know p anyway i went down stair and order to get my money back so about 1520 minut have pass now the clerk went to the back to talk to his manag he talk for about 15 minut come back out and doe some type on the comput then he say mam we would refund you your money but it say you have been in the room for past 30 minut  are you kid me it take at least 510 minut to walk from the front desk to my hotel plus ive been stand there for 15 minut wait on him and he know that and that basic what i told him he then goe to the back again and the manag come out and instead of be nice and comfort the custom no she act like a total  b  ok so all this argu goe on and she doe not want to refund the money nor doe she make me feel better custom is suppos to alway be right 

so final i demand a differ room at the least and she give it to us so when we are head to the room we ask a differ hotel clerk that check us in the first time where the nearest rest room was and this ahol say im off the clock and just keep walk serious dude just point your hand in the right direct nope we shouldv known shouldnt have wast our time ask ani way 

we get to our room it still disgust but hey at least my shampoo bottl isnt half use oh look our lamp and fridg work even though it suck lol oh and the most import thing the servic card whoever clean the room was sign lol but yeah this place was horribl usual custom servic help make up for ani mishap but not here that probabl whi you would never want to stay here you can pay the same price and stay at the platinum hotel i stay there after this place and it made up for everyth then again im sure ani other motel would be better than the riviera

long descript but this was a horrif place and i want it to be known 
do not wast your time like we didhorribl experi dont stay at this hotel 
front desk manag is terribl clarissaprobabl one of the worst run and seedi casino hotel

sadyear ago when the sahara hotel  casino 1st ad the nascar cafe  speed the ride i came here for a burger and for the life of me i cant recal if it was good or bad


i decid to bring my son here for some video game fun and a bite to eat when we arriv a b3 challeng was get start and a crowd quick gather to take photo and video befor we left 2 peopl had tri and fail the challenge


w order some soft drink to start they serv pepsi but the popular drink seem to be the 180oz tower of beer almost everi tabl had one


th menu is just bar food with american  mexican optionsburg  burrito we order chicken finger and a monster 1 pound blt sandwich both with fries


it took awhil for the food to come out and when it did it was not impress at all


th chicken finger were clear overcook they almost snap they were so dri and crisp no season and the fri were cheap frozen fri with no salt or seasoning


th blt had alot of bacon but it was the cheap stuff not fulli cook not crisp like a blt should be veri littl tomato and lettuc definit disproportion to the sandwich and the baconmayogross the fri cheap frozen cur fri with no salt


just plain bad bar food and veri pricy35 for 1 adult 1 kid neither of us ate 12 our meal and the servic was sketchi at best


not the b3 challeng onli cost 20 if you fail  you get a tshirt it would be worth it if the food wasnt so damn badi never thought ice cube could steer me wrongiv tri this place twice all becaus of his it was a good day song  twice their burger was ined it is not a fat burger more like a realli slim anorex burger i order a babi burger  ask for it to be well doneomg the bread was hard and the meat patti was cold  not cook all the way through i freak out when i see that much pink in my burgerin fact the patti was so cold it didnt even melt the chees that was on there man even if im starvin at 2 am i will not eat their shitti ass burgerwent here last night with my husband for valentin day and food was horrible

let me start off by say i had del frisco 3 time in nyc and it was amaz so while were in town i suggest we tri del frisco   the servic was excel but the steak was a big disappoint  i order the bonein filet and my husband had the doubleeagl  both want medium rareth first time they brought our steak out it was medium well so we sent it back second time around was even worsemin was still cold in the middl and my husband was so rare he could bare chew  they were 70 per steak but by the time the second steak was brought out we were tire and starv so decid to just eat what we could and left

conclus i will never return here be that they are a steakhous they should know what medium rare is vs medium well or rarelv yelper stay away

note to manag train 101 oh were terribl sorri for the simpl mistak mr f here we will have a tabl in just a few moment thank you so much for your patienc 

note to upper manag fire lower manag and the hostessmy parti was extrem disappoint and upset about our experi at dinner 

we made reserv day befor at 730 note that it was my father birthday  arriv on time befor we order we told the server in advanc that we had a 9pm show the server said that was fine and it wouldnt take that long we put our order in and talk amongst ourselv and snap pictur while we wait after wait 1 hour and 20 min my parti and i were get nervous about be late for our show dure this wait time we did not even get check up on

 my boyfriend final got up and tri to cancel our order with the host but she told him that she couldnt do that and we had to wait while she page our waiter so we wait anoth 10 min our waiter never show and a manag came over to charg us and say the beef wellington took a long time to cook waiter told us he had it in the oven with 5 other and was come our fast tsk tsk by that point we didnt even want to argu and just want to catch our show everyon in our parti then left and said they would meet us down by the casino

then a waiter come with 1 out of the five entre im guess in hope to keep us but i told him we alreadi cancel our order and he didnt care and went away serious cant you see we have an empti tabl bf and i stay back to pay for drink and that we are not at all happi and again how is one entre out of five suppos to be ok

whil leav we notic a few other coupl tabl cancel their order and leav also we thought this was so weird becaus they had a lot of tabl empti but whatev we were look forward to this dinner for week and it is so disappoint that it end this way especi sinc we went out of the way and told them that we had a show and ask if the dish we order were ok with our time frame 

so sad i wont ever be return but this horribl servic was the worsti liter cri leav this place i just cant even

matt decid to come here for his birthday lunch for someodd reason after perus the menu i decid on the neat loaf and fri a lot of thing on the menu are in quot you will see them use in this review as well and matt got the purpl burrito and we both got two small fiji water the total was over 31 i thought of the centurylink internet bill that was around the same price and bit down and paid i hope that the food we would get would be delici and amaz for that price 

now befor i go into the food see what i did there section of my review let me talk about the actual properti it sit right next to the lake and is gorgeous ton of duck were gather outsid when you go in there isnt too much room to move about and when you get to order you dont quit know where to go after our order were taken i guess the guy assum we had been there befor becaus we got no direct final we saw someon els pay so befor our food came out i paid and the woman behind the regist was confus sinc appar peopl come up and pay after their meal find the regist in the first place was difficult the place has a veri strang layout 

anyhow after 15 minut or so we got our food the entir plate look unappet the neat loaf was just a rectangularshap lump of brown stuff the fri were well noth like fri whatsoev and two small triangl of the hardest bread ever that should truli come with a warn sinc i swore i almost chip a tooth on them i receiv some random mix veggi salad on the side and two piec of fruit as well as some orang past for the fri be complet honest i couldnt even identifi what was on my plate with the except of the two piec of fruit i realli tri to be openmind and start to eat what was on my plate but everyth tast off not a thing on my plate was edibl the flavor that were there were so strang peculiar and realli hard to describ i just know that they were terribl i couldnt eat more than 4 bite befor i had had enough and trust me  this morn i was starv and i would much rather prefer to starv than eat here again

mayb im the crazi one but i dont think that an oven is necessarili a bad thing mayb matt and i both order the wrong thing or should have order a ridicul price smoothi but i cant believ that anyon in their right mind think that what was on my plate was flavor and tasti i cant believ i spent 1388 on a plate of veget mush as a vegan im use to eat new thing that might not work in theori but this just did not work at all and at least those question item were still edibl and identifi i was so angri that i just cri instead upon leav go raw and i know for a fact i will never be backwhen i say god aw im not exagger  ask for a special smoothi and while they were make it notic it was extrem thick  that not a smoothi that a blend banana 
i ask them if they could pleas add more almond milk and they respond by say all our smoothi are thick 
 they then proceed to add regular water not almond milk like i ask  didnt fix the problem  think eggnog with a cup of flower or corn starch mix in  
then they serv me my larg 10 smoothi which in ani other place would be consid a medium size and it was still so thick so chunki it was like oatmeal   it wasnt a drink it was a puré banana in a cup  not exact refresh  or even drinkabl in 110degre weather post workout  almost got a brain aneur tri to suck it through a straw  thank for the spoon but it still tast like crap  

also got a lemon grass shot at 3oz 
when i was done at this horrend establish that was also dark crowd and poor spaceddisplay  i went immedi to the smoothi king down the street so i could final find someth to quench my thirst  and while i dont like chain i just need someth to drink that was palat and quickly
wheatgrass was 3 for 2oz half the price  mayb go raw has some special type of holist organ special wheatgrass that has been carri into vega by a yogi healer that protect said wheatgrass from the drove of vultur tri to hord it green nutrient  or mayb they were just charg twice the price for the same thing i could get down the street

did i mention how rude and unaccommod the staff was at go douch cafe  also slow  not like we are busi slow more like we just dont care slow  

so if you want bad food at extrem high price and serv with poor attitud in an aesthet unapp place this is your spot 

note to owner take a trip to la visit earthbar on santa monica blvd and learn how to oper a business

just caus your sell special food to a special audienc doesnt give you the right to act like a bunch of fart smell douchthe food was just standard thai food noth spectacular greasi if anyth the servic is where it hit rock bottom  i had order it for deliveri and didnt look at the receipt until later  there was a discrep with my bill where a coupon was suppos to be appli i notic the mistak and call them back the ladi im assum is linda as my receipt say said you can use that coupon for the next visit then next excus the credit card machin is closeduhhh realli and then etc etc after back and forth convers she was make it realli difficult and even insult say that it onli 5 dollar i understand it may onli be 5 but she was rude in everi way and at this point i knew i was never come back again   so yes ladi i do want my 5 back  final she said she would refund me the differ while make snide remark the whole time and final ill get that money back to you and just hung up on mewow they have made me gone and done it this time just when i think it is safe to return to use a gift card that i had won from work they go and fk it all up

i realli dislik this locat as the staff is alway scatter brain it seem like the turnov is daili everi time i come here it is a differ untrain and unintellig kid behind the counter with that look on their face as if they want to run and hide under a rock becaus they fear a question

wel that is exact what happen again on my last freak visit to this store i ask the guy about price on the premad item they keep in the readi to go freezer noth was label proper so i had to ask what was in each thing such as the box of ice cream cooki ice cream cake etc etc each time that requir said employe to run to the other side of the store to ask anoth employe after said employe make his 6th trip i final gave up and bought a surpris pint of ice cream from the freezer

thi locat suck sour ass and i will never be back to take part in the miseri ever again 

baskin robbin you have my offici vote i should have never stray to come to this shipwreck of an operodd enough i wasnt look to do ani gambl on this trip to vega sad though the onli gambl that did happen was roll the dice on what i expect to be a sure bet this place base off reviewsprais and we end up lose 

im not even sure how to describ the nightmar of this dinner you ever get waiter envi you know like your eat at a restaur and you happen to notic the peopl next to you get a waiter serv them that is so much better than the one you got oh man i was so covet my neighbor waiter 

if i were to say the servic was flat out horribl that would impli that there was ani level of servic there was none this had to be the waiter experi ever 

made reserv for 8 got seat by 805 waiter 2 came and took water request waiter 1 came by to give us menus by 815 disappear for a good 20 minut without explain the food menu at all even though we told him that it was our first time 

also note two waiter hmmm okay one was for clean up and the other was the main waiter 

waiter 2 bring us silver wear around 820 825 pass odd enough no water still 830 i final flag him down and ask where the water hes surpris and you can tell he forgot he goe back and get water quick well at least he came back waiter 1 still has not shown back up from give us our menus at 815 and it now 840

i could not hear waiter when he first explain menu from my side of the tabl so i get my order place in wrong for the three cours prefix menu he ask what do we want to drink we never got a drink menu ugh 

bi 850 we final have our order place sit there 50 minut and our food was bare order becaus of disappear waiter was he perform at the rio with penn  teller 

he come back with drink menu we place order he come back and tell us one drink is out he offer no suggest as to what would be like it 

first cours come out around 915  it pretti decent texa shrimp were tasti not too bad not worth the damn hour and 15 minut wait it been so far 

we sit there for a good 30 minut and no one check on us no one done anyth the peopl to my right have the same waiter and they mention how bad the servic is and how the person sit on my side of the tabl couldnt hear the waiter either when he explain the menu 

at this point im pretti damn peev where this great servic an hour and forti five minut later i get a manag and tell them what the hell the lack of servic was kill me the entre final come out after which ive been complain you can tell the wait staff got a mouth full from her as there tension there 

steak was cook rare when order med my bass was tasti but it was made bitter from this extra long wait at this point we just had a bad tast in our mouth and well the whole night had been ruin 

when travel we general do one fanci meal and this was expect to be that fanci meal it turn out to a disast and we just want out of there 

what made it wors was that through the whole wait period we couldnt help but notic the tabl to my left who had a differ waiter who was get amaz servic she was on top of her game she went down the menu and explain it perfect i mean i couldnt even hear our waiter from the other side of the tabl and yet this other waiter was talk loud and clear enough that i could hear her two tabl down 

she also had a situat where the wine that was order was out and she went down a list of other recommend as to what to replac it with in term of same like i mean this waiter was someth els it made our situat with our waiter feel so much wors like you mean to tell me that if we onli sat two tabl down this whole night would have been so much better 

now i know how it feel to piss your quarter away at a slot machin and then have the person one machin over win the jack pot 

but this nightmar wasnt over yet we were done we didnt want to eat anymor the appitit was so an hour and thirti minut ago so we ask them to box it up which lead to an even more awkward situat um how do i trust someon who just got a verbal ass kick becaus of me 

i dont think i ever trust ani left over less than i did that box that came out

then they ask if we want dessert forget that it came with one of the prefix meal thank 

the manag that night apolog and gave me her card whi i have no idea she deduct about 60 off the bill but even then 40 for what amount to appet and the wors servic i have ever receiv yeah no thank i have 700 review and onli 50 1 star that should tell you someth about how i felt complet fuck come here
reserv for 8pm
25 min for water
50min to order

left there almost by 11pm 
wors meal  experi everit has taken me a long time to write this review  this was one of my first favorit restaur in las vega when we were think of move here a coupl of year ago  i had been and tri everyth and love it 
then my wife  our friend that introduc it to us and i went togeth  the food was great  were tri everyth  my wife order a turkish coffe  she was drink it and enjoy it  all of sudden she got veri quiet  i ask her what was wrong  she point to her coffe cup  i look into it  and thought i saw a coffe bean  i said so  she told me to look again  which i did  there was a cockroach cook in the coffe my wife was nauseat we call over the waitress show it to her and here is the part that earn the one star she did not even realli react she just said she will take the price of the coffe off the bill and then we start realli look around and saw two more dead cockroaches
i am not say she should have brought the owner out told the chef had him prostrat himself beg his forgiv or anyth i am not say she should have offer the entir meal comp 
i am say she should have react a littl look at least surprised
thi was and is the greatest dine disappoint i have had in las vega yet i still look for the perfect middl eastern restaur here and have found a few good onei have been order from metro for four year now and everi time i order it has gotten progress wors i use to think they were one of the better pizza in vega that dont say much becaus most pizza out here is terribl in comparison to the brooklyn pizza i am use to 
what has total turn me away from metro pizza is the recent run around i had with my take out order i order two dinner and two salad the eggplant dinner was extrem greasi and burn then when i got to the bottom of my salad there was a 6inch diamet piec of plastic at the bottom of my salad now have eaten most of my meal i was so sick to my stomach i vow to never eat from metro pizza again when i call back to tell the manag and get a refund she was rude didnt believ me and was reluct to give me ani attent i felt i deserv better servic then this especi sinc i belong to their pizza club in this club they send me coupon that are practic useless and if i save eight pizza clip from the mailer i can get one pizza free if i dinein now these coupon if your lucki come onc a month so i have to wait about a year of eat pizza from this crap place to get one free i should get one free just becaus metro pizza charg way too much for a regular pizza as it is all in all this place will never get my busi againif i could give this place zero star i so would

memphi championship barbecu more likememphi yuckyionship barbecue

so we walk in and are greet by these teenag that just stare at us then after a minut of stand there they final say someth she ask how mani i look at the both of us count and said uh twoduh

so we get seat the waitress take our order we both order the blue ribbon lunch special for the main dish you can choos two meat and one side i chose the brisket and hot link with a side of bake bean the brisket was extrem extrem  extrem dri i cant stretch that enough i thought i was chew on a tire that had been left in the sahara desert for 20 year then taken to the sun for anoth 20 year that how dri and rough the brisket was the hot link were ok at best and the bean were just gross 

the food came out cold and the servic was aw the onli time i saw our waitress was to get our order drop off the food and drop the check not onc did she come back to check and see if the food was ok or even offer refil on our drink 

horribl food check
bad servic check
wast of 45 min outta my life that i can never get back check 

pleas avoid this place at all costit sound like a good idea to give memphi anoth tri yet again be from kansa citi one of america 4 bbq capit sometim you get a crave for bbq and noth els will do but the last coupl of time my fiance and i have went to memphi it suck let just do thisher we go 

1 you call to get on the wait list then when you get thereyou still have to wait even when peopl who came in behind you get seat first 
2 slow servic seriouslyi had to get my own kid menu from the front counter 
3 enjoy the bread one basket is all youll get 
4 take your time figur out what you want to eat your waiter will be so slow you can reread the menu 5 time heck pull out your phone and googl the owner name mike mill youv got plenti of time 
5 more lukewarm food serious it a bbq place im all for slow cook but dang put some heat in it befor you bring it to the tabl and im talk physic temp not heat measur in scovill unit 
6 where the magic dust it tast good on prior visit but our tabl was miss a bottl of it this time around 
7 spici sauc there noth like have to ask for and then final someon bring out a clog up bottl of sauc to show just how much the staff give a damn about the product theyr bring to the tabl and the spici sauc was an absolut  disgrac that anyon who claim to know anyth about good bbq would never ever send to the tabl 
8 yeah my tea is empti and my plate isnt finish whi yes i would like a refilloh wait your too busi flirt with the blond at the tabl across from us to even notic our empti tea glass sorri guy she was too cute for you and your chanc of get her phone number are the same as me win megabuck powerbal and megamillion in the same week aint ever gonna happen 
9 onion straw this dish should be label as a tribut to crisco dish at least the tabl has a big roll of paper towel perfect for spit someth back out 
10 the brisketwa not bad except for the fact it was cold 
11 i think one of the type of meat was chicken but if i was in front of a judg and had to say under oath what i thought it was i would have to say i honest didnt know 

this visit was so bad i cring at even leav a 15 tip i know the wait staff need tip to make a live but this was just bad and i cant reward bad food and crappi servic no matter how sympathet i want to be 

1 star and this time i gotta add memphi to my jackasseri list becaus yes i think even have a jackass kick over a bbq grill would still be an improv over what was serv to me tonight

if your look for a spanish style brunch check out firefli brunchlet me start out by state that i have been to yama sushi 5 time and consid it a top sushi establish in las vega that all chang within one visit

mi friend and i were seat at the bar around 1130 am there were mayb 10 peopl in the restaur veri quit both do all you can eat my friend and i order about 5 item with the sushi chef within 45 minut we got 2 out of the 5 item we order i proceed to ask the waitress if we could order some roll from her and she said no as the restaur began to fill up and becom veri busi 10 minut later i complain to the waitress that we still didnt get the item we order almost an hour ago after debat with her she accept the order 5 minut later the sushi chef shove a roll in front of my face demand me to eat i have never felt so disrespect in a food establish in my entir life not to mention the few roll we did get the sushi qualiti was horrif a goopey cream chees and mushi fish tast stay in mouth the entir day

long stori short my friend and i battl with the waitress for her to comp our meal sinc we were dissatisfi with the servic and did not even get our food whi should one pay for food they did not get after debat with her yet again she come back to us and offer us 10 percent off that when i flip my gasket and start to make a scene my friend yell at the sushi chef for treat us with disrespect and i ensur that we would not leav the restaur without ani sort of comp we got out of there split one all you can eat price but they lost more than just 2299 they lost two loyal custom and ani recommend to ani las vega sushi goer 

yama is a total disast take my advic and save your money by do ala cart at a qualiti restaurim no sushi connoisseur but i know when i tast crappi fish im no restaurateur but even i know that good custom servic is the way you make fan and have them come back im not a picki y eater but yama was just clear unaccept 

this restaur is super tini im not hate on the size of the restaur but when the tabl are so close togeth that you can hear the convers of those around you more than your own then this becom a problem get in between tabl to take a seat was a near imposs mission in as well by no mean am i a larg individu but i had to suck in pretti hard to get to my chair 

our waitress was prompt in get our drink order two water she took my friend ayc order and start to walk away umm hello what about my order we call her back to order my lunch special  veggi tempura 4 piec of sushi rice miso soup and salad 

after about 5 minut we final got our water mine had a black speck in it my friend and i were convinc that it look like a dead bug resembl a gnat the waitress insist that this gnat was a green tea leaf whether a bug or a green tea leaf noth should be float around in my water 

i let the water fiasco slide and order a diet coke no joke i wait about 15 minut for it my friend and i ask three differ waitress for my beverag i was parch not onli this my friend got his sushi but wasnt given his wasabi and ginger this also took about 15 minut in addit to kind ask three differ waitress mind you it was not busi  there were empti tabl around the restaur 

the fish was dri and had a rubberi consist i felt as though it was left out for a while while my friend and i were tri our best to enjoy the notsoyummi fish my friend found a hair in the ginger that was the end of our meal dunzo finito 

vega has some of the best ayc sushi and yama is not one of them needless to say i wont be backwarn do not come to this restaur if you eat sushi often

i dont consid myself an expert on sushi but ive eaten at a lot of good sushi place around the socal area my favorit place are sushi ota in san diego and ootoro in walnut i also like place like akasaka in rowland height and i even enjoy the cheaper sushi joint like ani of the revolv kula bar and also sushi q in chino hill with that be said this is absolut the worst sushi restaur ive ever had the misfortun of trying

w tri pretti much everyth the salmon the tuna the yellowtail the sweet shrimp the uni the cook fish the hand roll the specialti roll you name it there was not one piec of fish that was appet when eat sashimi you want it to be fresh and you want the piec that melt in your mouth well the sashimi here was the opposit it was so dri i felt like i was swallow paper at time im not even joke here even prepackag sushi at japanes mart are signific better than the stuff serv at this sorri excus for a sushi joint

honest the best thing i had here was the miso soup i shit you not even the edamam was disappoint the edamame

to say the least this meal was the worst meal ive had in a veri long time if your not from around vega dont wast a precious meal come here your stomach will thank mei was go to give this place 34 star the servic was mediocr but the food was actual pretti good but then i saw the sushi chef start throw piec of fish from the fridg on to his cut board in the process i saw him drop a piec of squid on to the floor after he finish throw the rest of the fish on to the cut board he thought he was be slick and pick up that piec of squid walk over to the sink and start rins it off but i saw him do that he turn around and we lock eye and he knew that i caught him be shadi he quick return to rins off the fish and quick threw it back into a bin insid the fridg and then he quick beelin it into the kitchen

gross this all happen as i was on my way out of the restaur im hope that didnt happen to ani of my fish or your fish for that matterokay i do not hand out one star veri often here goes

first i want to say we were a parti of 7 and there was a 2 top that was there and a 8 top that alreadi had their food 

food last time i check there werent potato in minestron soup howev my veget soup minestron had decent flavor not veri mani veget my husband had the special linguin pescator assort seafood scallop shrimp mussel calamari he ate it all no complaint my cousin had some angel hair pasta dish one bite push it asid and wouldnt take anoth bite what kind of waiter doesnt inquir what is the matter she was worri about send food back my friend said the meatbal had good flavor anoth said the veal parmesan was realli salti 
servic there was a guy i think he was the busser he had a ponytail he was veri help and ran his tail off we wait a realli long time for our food it did warn us on our menu that the food take awhil  becaus it made to order i get that but it was longer than i have ever wait our waiter was not veri help and onli saw him 2 time he took our order and brought our check i will get to that later

beverag hous cabernet at 900 a glass i probabl could have bout the case at costco for that price  not the most generous pour then again whi would i want more of it my husband and anoth gentleman had 6 beer total  5400 befor tax and tip there are no price on their beer select 

now this is where the real issu come in 

they do not have a comput so the write on the check is realli messi if we didnt tri to separ our check ourselv we wouldnt have notic that they charg us for 8 meal instead of 7 he took the check and count the meal on the check and then point his finger as if a teacher in preschool count the 7 of us i think i can count he serv us he should know how mani of us there was i am hope it was an accid my issu is that he onli brought out 7 plate he didnt even bring us 8 so i am question his honesti then he deduct the 2400 for the mistak from the total i had to ask him to deduct the tip and tax for the meal also 

bottom line if one of the guy that he gave the check to just slap down his credit card without look the waiter could have pocket anoth 2650 besid that 5100 he got for the tip that was ad in 

servic was terribl  most of the food not worth they money atmospher was super quit and dreari i found this place on yelp i am veri disappoint fellow yelperi am in las vega on busi and work late i didnt want to go out anywher and had a flyer under my hotel room door i order the lasagna and garlic bread i was told it would be deliv in 45 min  1 hour i call after 1 hour 20 minut and was told it on it way i final got it about 10 minut after i call 15 hour after order the lasagna was bare warm almost cold and the garlic bread was dri and hard the soda was cold which tell me the lasagna sat there for a while befor the deliveri guy grab the soda out of the cooler and brought it to me i ate it becaus it was late and i didnt want to go anywher the next day i was sick to my stomach and spent most of the day in the restroomallyoucaneat sushi  

more like allyoucanbaretowaitforbecausetheservicewassodamnslow sushi

i swear we onli got like 10 worth of sushi in the hour and a half we were there

w were abl to watch danc with wolv and listen to novemb rain in between each order we got

boo on them

p  was this realli my 200th review  damn  what a wast of a milestonwhen i read about their 10 allyoucaneat promo a few week ago i made plan to attend with a big group of friend sushi mon isnt our favorit place and we figur the wait would be pretti long but sinc they clear advertis a no reserv polici we figur it would be worth it to go and wait we were sever wrong 

when we arriv there were a few peopl gather outsid and the restaur was full but it wasnt too bad when i went to the hostess to put our name on the list we were inform they were book solid until the end of their event and we couldnt be serv even though our whole parti was present so much for the no reserv polici 

save yourself the troubl there allyoucaneat sushi place nearbi with better flavor and similar pricesw wont be returnjust say no no no to ho ho ho


i made the mistak of use their restroom after i had just place my order for garlic shrimp

it was dirti the sink had black dirt residu it was so filthi and the bathroom is also use as a storag facil although they had toilet seat cover in box they were not stock for use

i was on lunch at work and decid on the garlic shrimp wlo mein soft noodles

ther was veri littl shrimp it was most water chestnut bamboo shoot and mushroom i realli think it should be name garlic mushroom becaus that was all it was

th lo mein noodl were even horribl as they were way too salti thick and dri with zero flavor

that was my first and last visit

i have had some bad chines food in the past howev this realli is the worst i have ever had no doubt

it is an insult to associ the word gourmet in ani way shape or form with this disast of a chines restaurant

nev again

mi mistak for not read yelp review prior to visit as i have never been here befor i was on lunch from work and drove by and stop if i had read yelp first then i would have never stop to dine herethis review is my real experi at hikari  no exagger or bs and none needed

hikari is an embarass to japanes busi on the whole if they continu to practic custom discrimin  

i order from the kid menu for my 3 yo and the sushi ayc for myself  
i specif mark nigiri sushi on the order slip but the japanes waitress assum i didnt know what i was order  after scrutin the order like an ir auditor she apathet repeat quit a few time nigili with licesashimi no lice  she went as far as almost warn  you no eat the lice we charg for wast  

then she cold mutter no shale and walk away  again assum we didnt know the rule of ayc  

after finish my modest order of nigiri i order a coupl of salmon skin handrol  this time the waitress said hand loll loll biggggg you not finish  omg she was assum and discrimin again just coz i dont look like someon with a sumo wrestler appetite

i would be lie if i said we enjoy our meal  the whole time we were eat the waitress watch us like a cctv  my 3 yo innoc reach over for one of the nigiri and she was over at our tabl quicker than a new york minut stern repeat the golden rule of ayc  no shale and walk away   i understand she was look out for the busi but she was take it a littl too far without be discret about it  what do you want me to do chastis my 3 yo over sushi 

i had order a total of 12 item from the ayc menu over 3 separ time but onli receiv 9 item  is the establish assum that i cannot possibl finish my food 

here the kicker when i ask for the check the waitress hand me the bill stapl to ayc order slip which werent even mine but the  amount was correct

btw have i mention the qualiti of the food   

it was definit not worth the 5mile trek west of the strip  at best hikari is just a neighborhood ma  pa place for local not a must tri destin for outoftown  there are better sushi joint on the strip  

the raw ostion look like they were on a diet  pathet shrunken and undernourish morsel sit in overs half shell  the raw fish on the nigiri tast like they were precut and not fresh slice  the salmon skin insid of the handrol were not crispi  in fact the roll look like a  sheet of seawe roll into a cone which was exact what it was coz the fill certain didnt leav ani last impression
  
the food from the kid menu was salti  greasi  do they want the kid to die young or are they assum that kid dont know ani better

i dont know how hikari review get all the star  just dont discrimin or play game with your custom and treat them with respectthis was a nobrain we were all thorough disappoint with the food and servic here we were excit to check this place out after our 5star experi at sushi twister the ayc menu here was appet at first but when the food actual arriv to our tabl it was absolut horrifi the fish qualiti was way below par the present was unaccept and the flavor were terribl lack 

mani review point out that this ayc joint offer sashimi in addit to just nigiri or roll well if you want the junk part of the fish butcher by a 5year old then by all mean go for it im not exaggeratingth mix sashimi plate consist of various fish end with hole in them i could not believ that someon would expect me to eat that and unfortun everyth els was just as gross even the roll were offput mushi sushi rice and sriracha sauc everywher the onli edibl item was the agedashi tofu from the kitchen which is most what we end up eat to cleans our palates

th waitress were complet oblivi and rare came around to check on us the bill includ a 18 tip for our parti of four which i actual felt shouldv been pay to us for endur such hardship 

well this was our first and last time herein one word  ew  i do not write review normal but the custom servic is so terribl i must warn fellow yelper  i will tri be fair in my comment here and give credit where it due almost no where came here becaus a cowork love it

befor we get into the ownermanag attitud problem let talk about the food first we did the ayc menu for dinner the fact that they offer sashimi is a plus i will say that the basic like salmon and hamachi were ok soft shell crab was ok too  but what is up with the kama that took onli three minut to come out and has the textur of fish jerki also the cajun albacor was not sear more like half cook to a hard textur the uni was question in color for sure  almost brown i wish i had read warn about that and the big ball of rice in previous review prior to go we did overord unfortun and my friend want to get all our order of uni in one go  there were four of us i interrupt and said let get half for now which would be 8 piec  well guess the server heard what my friend said but ignor what i said  becaus 16 piec came out  we want to send it back but then decid to just suck it up what could go wrong a lot 

not all of us ate it becaus of the weird color  my friend was struggl to eat it all so he left some rice  the server took our plate away with the rice and warn us that becaus this is ayc if we continu to leav rice they will have to charg us ok point taken  so we were good about the rest of the rice we had but no matter  they charg us 12 extra for the rice anyway  and tack on 18 gratuiti for our parti of four it would have been nice to be given the chanc to rectifi our mistak instead of just take the plate and ad the charg but whatev  we did not disput it  we did howev we feel compel to let the server know that she made a mistak of bring out 16 piec so we told her upon pay all she need to say was sorri we misundestood each other but instead she decid to get defens and said we order a lot of sashimi anyway so she had to charg us extra for the unfinish rice from the sushi which btw  we did not even bring up then she grab whom i shall call crazi old bat and i assum is the owner 

well cob began to throw her arm and get all defens about how 8 mean 8 order of two and then got all defens again about the extra charg again we were not disput it just point out your error cob also turn her back to us point at our credit card in the server hand and told the server in this matteroffact tone to just charg them then walk away without let us finish what we had to say what a psycho perhap there was miscommun on both our part but to be talk down to like that is a whole other issu i am not ok with i am in the servic industri and i cant imagin anyon in our compani talk to a custom like that and keep their job  bill came to almost 40 per person  

im give this one star becaus yelp make you give a minimum of one whatev point they score was quick taken to a zero with that crap show they gave at the end ew take a hike hikarisorri everyon  this was one of the worst experi in dine i have ever had

thi is by far one of the most over rate place in the countri 

food  pizza and salad good
serv  good  felt sorri for the guy  i didnt tip and told him that he should blame the hostess stand
wait  2 hour  which is fine if the hostess stand would have been more accomod for those wait 

total vibe from hostess stand  poor beyond description

i dont mind sit around for 2 hour to be seat  if the dine experi was out of this world  

felt the hostess stand was high ineffici with seat that whi it take so long  i felt they were rude an unaccomodating

recommend  never  the pizza is not that good to sit around for 
go back  never  never   neveroverr overr overrated

theyv done a bangup job of public relat and convinc the trendi sheep that this is the equival of a pizza orgasm hmph it ok not great but it not like there arent other woodfir pizza joint in phoenix

bi the way i know real italian pizza i eat it regular in itali so dont give me crap about go eat at domino you dont know good pizza i do believ me i cook italian tuscan regularly

pizzeria bianco approach tradit italian pizza so id ordinarili give it 3 star howev i downgrad it to one due to the rude rude rude servic and how incred overpr it is

gotta hand it to bianco though hes got a good scam go i mean hes realli got it figur out hype the shit out of the place bribesuck up to all the restaur review who convinc the sheepl that you gotta go here if your somebodi brownnos the local celebr crowd into come there im sure they get treat much differ than us peon make the restaur too small and get peopl to spend money at your wine bar while endur the insan wait for a tabl fuck brilliantthis review is for the hostess only

w pull up to the park lot and the park attend say it a 4 hour wait howev to check in  he give us a tip that we can walk around the neighborhood but to call about 30 minut prior to the estim seat time  we check in at 920 pm and the blond hostess say the wait is 25 hour  that mean well be seat at midnight  she also say that we can check out the bar next door and they can call us from there  she state that the bar close at 10 pm so if we want to be in the bar we need to be insid  after think about it we didnt want to spoil our appetit by order food and drink so we decid to go back to the place where we were stay and chang to more comfort  after all the hostess wrote that we would be seat around 1145 pm on her notepad

w come back at 1045  one hour prior to when were suppos to be seat and shes say sorri i cant seat you becaus you werent here at 10 pm  excus me you said it 25 hour thus equal almost midnight  the hostess say you have to be here at 10 pm which we were like wtf  you said we could walk around  so it seem like this place want you to chill at the bar and order drink to get more  thus extend the wait time   i then told the hostess what the park attend had said that we could go around and in the futur for other patron to make sure that he had his fact straight  she alreadi tune out act like a doorman at a club  excus me but this place isnt a michelin star restaur or anyth  so dont give me your stuck up attitud   she then tri to go off on me like i was an idiot and i was like that okay i dont need to eat here that bad   whi quot 25 hour midnight youll be seat then expect custom to wait around for 2 hour  it serious doe not make ani sens   and doe a restaur serious expect you to wait 2 hour wait around  

so note to your manag pleas make sure that your park attend and hostess are on the same page when tell custom what they can and cannot do  im rate this place 1 star base on their custom servic of the hostess  the hostess was incred rude and snobbish   i would not recommend this place base off the hostess who is a repres of the restaurso we had heard about this place from the pizza book and we show up and i kid you not the place is the size of my shed and there is a line out the door and around the front of the build just to get your name list we final wait in a 40 min line and get to the front where the snotti littl bitch roll her eye and muster up with  it a 65 hour wait so your tabl will be readi at 1030pm wtf
so your tell me id get faster servic and better pizza if i board a plane for manhattan and even get to eat my favorit pizza befor this place can seat me
seri i am not sure if this man is a fucken retard or a a genius

get two shed  you had sooo much money walk away that night and i am sure it happen night after night but no then there are the idiot hipster and yuppi who insist on wait around get drunk and spend money at the bar oh the bar  you say
y the bar is often the place restaur make the most profit so perhap he is a genius becaus the place was pack there as well 

treat them like shit tell them no and to go away and wait at the bar for 65 hour and see how hungri and drunk you will be at 1030pm

i know what your say italiano

oh and with onli one bathroom for both men and women dont expect the line for the potti to be ani shorter

y we lefti had a horribl experi with this place so i may be bias i went in the middl of the summer to reserv a spot for cowork i was sweat overh hungri and miser i went next door to get a snack the bartend complet ignor me for 10 minut when he did come over he was snooti and a real bastard i order oliv to keep myself from pass out that took anoth 15 minut he brought it i gave him a 5 and he never return with my chang he didnt deserv my money
but onc we final enter the pizzeria it was bore and overhyp the wait staff was just as uninterest as the bartend and never brought refil or a glass of water
seri eff this placeif i could give you no star i would i went there on a thursday night at 915pm  the tabl were full but there were 5 seat at the bar the hostess manag told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar serious there are five seat open she then said that she had peopl wait for the bar well there was no one wait and no one in the hous next door the problem is that peopl think it is ok to wait 3 hour for ok pizza and be rush to finish becaus the media prais this place
ther are mani place in phoenix that are better cibo without the hostess attitud your a pizza place not the french laundri and yes i have had the pizza on 3 differ occas and it not that good  if you spent more time train your staff on custom servic you might be abl to open anoth locat but my guess is that your afraid toafter 18 year in the valley we final made the trek down to durants

first i will prefac my review by state that we did not stay for dinner long stori short we bail after they brought out the bread basket 

cut to the chase

cons

 enter through the kitchen isnt the best market strategi when your kitchen realli need a remodel
 the entir place need one of those remodel show to do a surpris make over
 carpet restaur leav your custom wonder just how dirti that carpet is
 a bar tender should know the wine list or at least be abl to muddl through a question about a bottl of wine
 bath room are a bit tire and need a remodel
 wait staff need some train a tad way to denni casual for us
 bread basket and vege plate need some work if i am drop 300 buck for 2 peopl pick up the level a bit
 small detail but the wine glass and glass wear need to be updat noth wors that drink a 150 bottl of wine out of a denni type glass silver wear is also right out of an institut 


pros

 wine list was pretti good with allot of great wine and reason price too


i am sure we are go against the grain here with this review but it simpli how we see it we typic have in our steak hous rotat mastro ocean club bourbon steak michael mina place and morton this place just isnt in that leagu while i will admit we never even got to the dinner i simpli made a judgment call that with all that we had seen up to order the food would not have been that good to over come all the con if your a 30 40s or even 50s coupl look for a hip crowd and great atmospher note to self this aint it

i am not a huge food critic to me it is more import to have a great atmospher fun hip crowd i get the whole oldest power lunch steak hous thing but eventu even the great need to earn their keep through someth other than their long live reputwell i dont know what to say 
i made dinner reserv and everyth and told the person on the phone that we are celebr an occass when we got there the host look up my reserv and then ask us if we want to sit at the bar wtf eat at the barwhi 
i did not want to spoil the mood so i polit said no and that we prefer a booth the dinner was amazingth oyster the steak the scallop and the dessertthey were all good 
but i am never go back there again i guess i wasnt an old white person and so they want me to have my 3cours 180 dinner at the bar realli well too bad coz you lost my busi forev there are plenti of great steakhous in the valley and i dont need this kind of treatment when i am out celebr with my familian upscal mexican restaur in the area seem like the best thing to have happen to me i plan my visit for a quieter even and review the menu again and again 

howev upon our arriv i thought twice immedi the park was iffi and the place didnt seem to stand up to the signag perhap the art was not to my like honest not a piec stand out in my memori 


we were seat immedi 

our waiter seem a littl off not to mention the fact that he was insan snobbi and seem to be moonlight in the kitchen where he disappear for 1015 minut at a time he did not fill our soft drink onc without be first flag down those of you who have experienc the close quarter will understand how ridicul this is 

halfway through wait for our food which took 45 minut easili the lamp abov our tabl went out we sat in the dark for a good 5 minut befor they even notic which was actual a nice chang of sceneri from the bore beig wall 

when the food final arriv we were too tire due to have finish an entir bottl of wine so we left unfortun we took our grub with us
i had some sort of mix seafood entre with chorizo and a creami sauc it no coincid your taken aback by the combin it didnt go down too easili have drop 90 dollar on the meal though we felt compel to finish as much as we could stand 

normal i would make sure i got the name of the dish right but sinc i am recommend that you not go there whi botherfriend dont let friend eat at tee pee

i take it all back this is the worst mexican joint in phoenix and that dubyuh ate here elev it to one star he probabl love it whi do you think it call tex mex

green sauc was this dirti water with float spice leav ugh rice typic too much pepper tomato not fresh salsa not fresh lowgrad chees blech

tabl too small and on top of each other firstgener mini blind saggi bent filthi and old dingi wall kitsch includ glowi virgin fake and fade plastic greeneri add to it scream children who at some point seem to be tri to outscream each other and youv got the essenc of the ambianc which is tee pee

servic is veri friend and staff is dedic to keep the dinner move if onli the food were edibl and the surround a bit freshereverytim i have been here it just appal me this place is still in business

thi place seem like a total dump while it may be out of context to jaim ms review i will confirm this place is a dump it horrid i have on more then 3 occas seen roach scurri across the ground on one occas wit a minor stir bean in a larg pot never have i had a good experi here some of my famili member love this place and come and drink margarita from noon till they decid to leav so i have been here enough time to know this is not a one time occurr bad review margarita are cheap but that becaus they are shit in my opinion i like tequila with my margarita mix umm thanks

th food ugh more then a few occas i have had intestin discomfort the tast is good but the second come of jesus 40 minut later is not good i hate to give this place such a bad review becaus my famili will hate me but ive voic my review to them enough they should expect this

stay away there are mani mexican restaur in arizona and if this is authent sonoran holi crap i prefer the nonauthent sonoran i get from other restaur i would go to manuel over this place ani day warn danger bring a fire extinguisher
can you say freak hot  i am all for a littl spice in my food but holi geezus

ok for those of you that like hot hot hot i mean burn your face off then later your butt you might enjoy this plethora of tortur me not so much my dumbass sister drug me and 4 other famili member that were visit from illinoi to this fire pit of hell

w order 2 pitcher of margarita that were more like dink lemonad yuck and they were way over price 3000 each kick  ass pitcher my ass 

i ask our server how hot is the green chili his respons to me was it mild i then proceed to order the machaca chimichanga with green chili sauc i love a good machaca chimi 

we wait for our meal sip the lemonad aka margarita munch veri salti chip mine without salsa becaus one bite of that left the tip of my tongu stinging

th food arriv it was a huge portion i thought there is a go box in my futur i took the first bite more dough than anyth as usual with a chimi the second bite brought my temperatur up about 10 degre i continu think i must have gotten a seed or chunk of pepper the third bite woohoo 3 alarm fire in my mouth after suck back an entir glass of water and sever tortilla chip i decid it was the green chile sauc on top and began push it off and away from my chimi i go in for the middl of the chimi where the machaca is and no sauc hell bell are you kid me that bite was the hottest of them all like i had found the scotch bonnet surpris 

i surrend i cannot continu with the tast bud massacr i think i am scar for life at this point my lip are burn i am sweat and i am devour a bowl of chip tri to put out the inferno rage insid my mouth my poor cousin are experienc the same type of hell all except for my cousin jenni who has no toler for heat and got the most expens chees crisp in phoenix 695 it chees and a tortilla peopl 

i stop the server and said there is no possibl way i can eat this it is entir too hot is there anyth on the menu other than the chees crisp that is not hot he brought me the menu i found a garlic shrimp dish and ok sound good for 1395 i got 5 veri larg shrimp cover in melt chees they tast like the follow recip place 5 larg shrimp in a small casserol dish sprinkl with as littl garlic powder as possibl add a hand full of chees then put in the microwav until chees melt it was aw gag gag gag it had no flavor at all i could even tast chees 

ok i will wrap this up as i now am rambl away i am not a spice whimp i love wasabi and lot of it but this kind of hot is not for the averag person who like hot i cannot tell you if the spici dish was good becaus the heat ruin it for me and my famili my sister is the onli one who like it 

i will not be back not worth the drive the time the money or the recoverioh barcelona i visit you with low expect  and you didnt disappoint

a love young woman of my recent acquaint invit me here recent for the purpos of attend a birthday parti for a friend of her neither of us would have come here otherwis 

if your think about go dont do it if you care for the deet read on if not stop read here and go somewher els pleas 

we show up at about 8 for drink and dinner i wasnt in a drink mood my date appletini was pretti appley but the amount of liquor was tini must be whi they call it an appletini hm highlight was the bread brought to the tabl  the pretzel roll were the highlight of the even how sad is that

now the place is call barcelona barcelona is a citi in spain the closest thing to a spanish dish on the menu us paella otherwis it a steakhous menu with a few obligatori pasta dish total uninspired

i order the ribey medium rare it came out medium and the glaze and whatev els they put on it were aw save the two onion ring i doubt this was usda prime beef it just wasnt that good and the room was so dark that it was hard to see what i was eat the shoestr fri side were a pleasant surpris  a giant mound of crispi potato 

mi date had some kind of pasta with shrimp dish the shrimp were overdon the pasta was ok denni pasta is ok too and let face it so is chef boyarde so dont read too much into the complement 

barcelona spain the place doesnt look that spanish on the insid there is a giant mural on the ceil dim light it remind me more of las vega chees than spain 

while you dine there are two scottsdouch or is it douchedal type croon back and forth to each other on stage is this where fail american idol contest tri to reliv their moment of glori i dont know they made a reappear later sing along with a dj to a select of bad 90s pop music with the occasion 80s parti jam 

the crowd is douchey the food is aw and on the pricey side the servic spotti 

if your come for the thing barcelona is famous for youll find a lot of it if not stay away far far awayi cant believ what im read peopl like this place

th first time i went it was a part there for my girlfriend work they had lay out a huge assort of food each piec i ate it got wors and wors it was weird 

for some reason i thought  well it could be becaus it is made in huge quantiti almost anywher has sucki food when cater 

we a few week later decid to go there sinc it was 20 ft from my girlfriend work and after pick her up we were too hungri to wait 


big mistak we got ignor for about 20 min then when i ask some question on the food or recommend she look at me like i told her her mom was fat she act soo insult for no reason it was weird

asid from the bizarr waitress who didnt get our food out till our bodi ate our own stomachs35 min extra total 55 min wait

th food final got there and it was soo gross i actual had to send it backi was too scare to reorder for fear it would be tamper with andi would have to wait longer and it would be just as bad i had to argu with her for 5 min say i just want it off the bill im sure it normal good but it ined dont worri ill tip you as if i got it still jeez real profession 

mi girlfriend food was equal as bad and she was too scare to tell the waitress after my ordeal 

i told her ill do it 

it shouldnt be this hard i told her we just cant eat ani of this and told her this is for you and put a 5 on the tabl and left 

i should have said this is for you and spit on the tabl rub the 5 on it and left  

ps your outfit are gaywth was i think when i decid to go back to los i must be a glutton for punish or someth after read the recent comment in the yelp talk section about los be the best thai food in america i decid to give them anoth tri i cant blame this mistak on caffein defici this time the mistak come down to stupid on my part for go back to a place that suck the first time los fail bad let break down my descent into thai hell that just happen 

1 if there a line of peopl wait to get in good luck get out the way the narrow front entranc is setup is a safeti hazard at best a code violat at worst  
2 wait staff cant even figur out how to open a bottl of wine saw that first hand 6 feet from me perhap staff member should go watch youtub and learn how to open a bottl without make it look like a broadway product to do so for a place that milk that wine list hard have staff that know how to open the bottl is to be expect what i saw waswel i start to wonder what he realli want to do with the bottl from all the contort he was go through to open it 
3 19 minut from time of order until my plate arriv komol make the same plate in exact 12 the time yes i time it i order like for like and compar time 
4 portion size komol offer you more food at less cost serious i left hungri at komol i dont 
5 servic is it too much to ask to get soy sauc good luck get anyon attent to get it much less give you your check 
6 that vaunt 50 page wine list of their is doubl and tripl space and frank it aint all that i look trust me i need someth to do while wait on my food 
7 speak of cost i can order chili mint chicken with an egg roll ginger salad and thai ice tea and even with leav a 25 tip at komol it was still half the cost of loss chili mint chicken egg roll and thai ice tea i chose a simpl dish so that i could compar them fair 
8 speak of thai ice tea it wasnt made proper and didnt tast as good as stuff ive had in la and elsewher here in vegas


anyon that think los is the best thai food in america is downright delusion and realli need to get out and explor more komol kick loss rear end and they are light year away from the qualiti of food at penn thai hous best in las vega yeah not buy that claim either i know this review may irrit a few diehard los defend but if a place suck it just suck call it as it is and be respect for speak your mind vs tri to prop up a place that doesnt deserv it 

1 star under protest 

mayb i should get some syrup of ipecac as the food not make my stomach happi either

edit 24 hour after i post this los get yelp review of the day wow they dont deserv the recogniti read all the review on osaka in summerlin and i sort of knew what i was get myself into i onli went becaus peopl had coupon and they insist on go so here is the review

thi place is hilari bad you know those realli bad movi that are so bad they actual turn out to be good troll 2 birdem mano the hand of fateetc i think those movi are the best metaphor for this restaur it was so bad now i get to tell stori to peopl about how bad it was and what may seem like hyperbol in the crap depart is the honest truth

start out with make a reserv for a regular tabl not teppanyaki for 630 we get there and not surpris they hadnt written down the reserv onc again i read all the other review so i came in with no unknown variabl so the invalid girl at the front say oh sorri it happen sometim ill get you a tabl readi not even kid basic say oh ya we are screwup and we know it whatareyagonnado 

so we sit at the couch for about 15 minut at which point we ask the troglodyt what happen to our tabl mind you there is like 2 other group in the entir restaur and the girl say oh wait you want a tabl and she was total serious actual mam i just decid it was in my best interest to sit on this uncomfort couch in this eastern european level sweatbox to pass time

i dont have enough room to go into everyth about the servic there but just impli that the entir meal was more of the same knock over drink touch the end of your hashi with their stank hand not have shoyu and just talk in a way that statement magic becom question use the higher inflect at the end of each sentenc a la valley girl

th food was serious garbag i could understand this type of sushi come from a 399 off strip all you can eat sushi buffet where peopl have just abandon all hope of eat good food but not from someplac that use the name of a onc stellar vega icon plus it was super expens for what it was

let me clear someth up for the osaka sushi chef who i think was some kind of romanian perhap sushi onli consist of 2 thing vinegar rice shari and anyth els neta anyon who has ever had good sushi will tell you the secret is cook techniqu qualiti and flavour of the rice and fresh of the ingredi well the rice had no vinegar in it no flavor at alli would say it was of chines takeout qualiti but that would be offens to chines takeout so they basic miss 12 of the essenti ingredi of sushi  

next the rice wasnt cook proper i think they just sort of dump rice in with water and decid meh that look right then put it in the dish steamer which is where in my mind i believ they cook the rice

fin they didnt even roll the sushi correct either they had the nori insid out or the nori was so cheap it didnt have bind but befor the plate had even gotten to my tabl it had fallen apart when i gave the server a look like wtf she just shrug and gave the i hate my job anyway noth you can do or say will make me feel wors than i do alreadi becaus i have to be here look back at me

th tempura was cook with the techniqu of an 8th grade cafeteria apprentic the batter clear wasnt cool becaus it was as greasi as it could get and all the veget had the consist of toxicwast guy from robocop 

last peopl in parti got sick

verdict with the rise of realli bad japanes restaur in las vega with a few except mayb the new trend is go toward realli bad sushi with a realli steep price but drown out in blast trendi music but if you actual want my advic stay far away from this place unless you want a hilari stori of caution about the downfal of the restaur industrithis place is a joke and not in a funni ha ha kind of way  although the circus like pink and purpl wall with green accent and leopard print chair were fun to look at  i came here with a big group of peopl for lunch and there were no redeem qualiti to this place  the food and the servic just flat suck  

first the food  now im not a fan of sushi but i love teriyaki and all i got today was under cook luke warm wet meat  no flavor whatsoev  the rest of my bento box was garbag to me  rice four babi california roll tempura with one sad shrimp some strang orang sauc and a veri sad ined salad  i also order a watermelon martini and the onli watermelon flavor it had was the garnish  horribl wast of alcohol 

now on to the servic which ad a mandatori eighteen percent gratuiti and the server didnt get a singl cent over it either it was that bad  our parti was all seat within a few minut and order were taken  someon was serv anoth person dish and the waitress insist it belong to the person she gave it to  food was be box up for some peopl befor other even got their meal  we had to continu to ask her where their food was  to top it off the person who got the wrong dish was charg for it  i will never recommend this place and if you are in the area crave teriyaki there is a teriyaki mad right next doortotal fail  reserv made week in advance14 peopl for the hibachi tabl and 45 minut later the manag joy i think her name is encourag us to move on to anoth restaur  wow realli  who doe that  

we had reserv for a birthday parti and what a clustermess  the whole time we were wait joy thought we were anoth parti  she didnt even have the reserv right  she was tell my guest that i didnt make the reserv till that daynot true there was a huge partywork present schedul for 6pm go on in their roomschedul for an hour when some of those guest were approach the manag to just feed themat this time it was 845pm  yes  it sound like a made up stori but for sure it real

to make a long stori short we did end up get reserv with the geisha hous on n decatur and i must say the place was pack and they fit us right in  know what we had been through they went over and beyond to make a bad situat right  top class  at the end of the night which end up be late due to start lateth whole staff came out and gave the birhtday girl a birthday song to rememb  the chef and waitress wer tip well as our bill was well over 1500

ive been a long time custom of osaka and i think i am final done go there  it use to be the happenin place and it just has fizzl out  i dont say often that i wont be back but be what an embarass and disappoint experi i can final say that they will not get our busi again  btw there wasnt even ani heartfelt apolog  so i apolog to you joy for your unwilling to make thing right and yet one more bad review for you  you had alot of first timer that definit wont be back either  just look at the other review i dont see how this place can recov and be what they were year agoi had sever trust famili member and a few yelper with similar tast as myself tell me that i need to make a stop at emeril  they all told me the same thing servic was top notch the food was amaz and everi singl one of them gave me rave review and stori about their even  so i mark it as a place we had to stop off at

let me just say that i do not hate emeril the chef  and while i cant stand to sit down and watch his cook show i actual respect him as a cook more import as a philanthropist with the foundat he has set up and all the work he has done to repair new orlean  that said i think i could have just given one of those foundat 200 buck cash and i think i would have been left feel more satisfi then i did din and pay for the meal that i had here

so let begin with the even we start out all well and good and we want to tri the chef tast menu my gf who is much smaller then me didnt think she could handl eat four cours so what we want to do was i would order the 4 cours tast menu and she would pick out three dish of her own she was go to get a salad soup and main and we were just go to split the dessert  the server then told us we couldnt becaus the kitchen couldnt get the time on the dish go out to the tabl  i then ask would it make it better if we order two dessert to which he said no  he then went and told us that if we each are sit at the same tabl and want to do the chef tast menu we each had to order it  i ask him if i were to come alon would i be allow to order the tast menu and he told me i could  i couldnt figur out or understand whi it would be differ if two peopl were sit at the same tabl  anywho we both got the tast menu in the end

salad  blue crab meat red onion carrot cucumb  mix green toss in sweet soy vinaigrett with fri pickl ginger and sesam seeds

simpl clean flavor the crab meat was cook to keep it natur sweet and delic textur which was great howev the vinaigrett was a bit strong for my tast can seem to overpow then entir dish  it was an ok dish it did seem like it was someth i could go to ani fusionasian restaur though

seafood  sweet barbecu loch duart salmon on andouill sausag and potato brabant with spici onion crust and emeril housemad worcestershire

with all the work and thing that they did for this dish it was ultim forgett at best what ever was on the crust for flavor was long gone by the time i got to eat it and with all the element that went into creat this dish i thought it would have had a bigger impact addit with all the ingredi the present of the dish was sloppy

meat  grill pork tenderloin  baja shrimp on white cheddar chees and chive mash potato with caramel onion reduct and flash fri kale

what can i say about this dish  this is where thing went realli down hill  we got our dish and first thing i notic is that the portion size are differ mine is smaller and more rectangular then her and even without cut it open i knew my piec was way overcook her on the other hand was pretti question undercook  bloodi pork  i thought the reason we did this all this was so they could get the cook time right on the tast menu  i was dumbfound and flag a server our was no where to be seen she then look at it and told us it was normal  i told her it was the pork dish from the tast menu not a beef dish  she then took it back and the chef went and refir her meat

desert  appl strudel with caramel sauc caramel ice cream and whip cream

i realli didnt get this dish i thought it was suppos to be a warm strudel dish but that could be enjoy with the ice cream and caramel sauc it was cold the entir dish was cold  the pastri shell on top was soggi and cold throughout it was actual frozen to the bottom of the plate  it was ined  two bite and we were done

sad the one good thing that stood out from this night is the bread it was the onli thing that i could say was realli good and memor  the rest of the menu was forgett poor execut and frank a disappoint  we saw our server onli a few time that night when he came to take our order when he brought two of our four dish and the check  that was it sad it was a veri slow weekend the restaur was veri empti and there was an abund of wait staff and bus boy but for some reason they were all to busi to refil drink  the coupl at the other tabl next to us said they notic the same thing  

so sorri guy emeril may have been a great restaur at one time but it wasnt when we were there and with all the choic of restaur in vega these day there are plenti of other place i would rather spend my moneyi was plan a special dinner for some veri import client this restaur was high rate not onli on yelp but also written up with high marksth food was veri good and the wine list was also impress with veri reason price ive had better but i still wouldv rate this restaur much higher if not for the complet unaccept servic or lack thereof we received

thi place take itself way too serious i know theyr tri to come off as upscal but rude doesnt equal upscal one of my cowork has veri special dietari need that requir her to bring her own food seal in a packag this is never a problem for ani restaur where she goe except for this one they were complet unaccommod mani of us place our phone discreet on the tabl and at one point when my phone so gentl chime indic a text messag i was prompt ask to silenc it even though each parti on either side of me didnt even hear it

thi attitud on top of the fact that we could never find a waiter to bring us anoth pricey bottl of wine when we need it just doesnt fli with me my client all were appal at this behavior and i felt like a loser for make a bad choic we all wish we had gone to the much more lowbrow and less pretenti old fashion next door next time save your money and do the sameaw food  aw servic  aw long wait for everything

it was go to be an hour wait at monti  blue plate diner or lazi jane café so we decid to go to the fair oak diner becaus it was empti  we should have waited

w had a group of 3 and sat down at the counter  after 10 minut of sit there the waitress come over and say a big order just went in ahead of you so it go to be a wait for the food  i look around and half the tabl are empti so i figur mayb it will be an extra 15 minut  i ask if i can just quick get a cinnamon roll and a glass of milk  both are sit in front of me behind the counter  20 minut later and have ask twice  i am still sit there wait  at this point we have been wait for 30 minut in a half empti restaur and we havent order receiv menus or gotten water

dur this time i had some time to look around the restaur  it was filthi  clean glass had lipstick or food still stuck on them  countertop and floor had ground in dirt indic that they hadnt been clean in year  the kitchen could be seen from my spot at the counter and i watch the cook wipe sweat from his forehead with a towel and then grab toast by hand to throw it on the griddl without wash his hand and chang his glove  mmmm yummi  i love sweat soak toast  i also love it when the sweat rag is use for wipe down counter  

we final order and i ask again if i can have a cinnamon roll and a glass of milk  10 minut later and after a fourth request it is basic thrown at me  the milk is warm  the cinnamon bun is stale and nasti  i finish neither  

20 minut later i ask our waitress if our food was actual cook yet  if it wasnt cook yet i just want to leav  she snide respond i warn you that it was go to be a wait when you sat down  i repli that i didnt complain about how long it was take  i simpli want to know if our food was cook or not yet becaus if it wasnt cook yet my famili just want to pay for the milk cinnamon roll and coffe and to leav  without check in the kitchen she rude snap back it cook ok  wait     

1 hour and 20 minut after our arriv our order came to the tabl one plate at a time  10 minut after that all three plate had arriv  my scrambl egg were complet overcook and drycrusti  my hash brown which were request extra crispi were cold and soggi  there was also a surpris chunk of mysteri meat in the middl which i surmis to be a stray bit of sausag from anoth dish cook on the same griddl  my toast wasnt toast and was soak with butter  

mi father had oatmeal  he said it was instant oatmeal and they did a bad job  he could have made better from a packet at home in 5 minut  the fruit on the oatmeal was basic strawberri sauc  his toast on the side was black  

mi mother order a veggi scrambler  the veget tast old she said  the egg were way overcook and drycrusti  two piec of her toast werent toast and the other two piec were black  

i paid 27 includ a 15 tip that i left  i deepli regret have pass on wait an hour to sit down at monti blue plate diner  i will never go back to the fair oak diner  i urg you not to go eitherthis is the bar to go to if you are look to get or give stds  

no thankupon arriv on this light crisp friday morn my son and i anticip great thing on our first visit to pancak cafe sinc they had left the univers ave locationour prior visit there were exquisite
not too heavili traffick at 8 30 am the seat was quick and our server cheeri we receiv coffe in a hot caraf at our tabl befor our seat even had the chanc to get warm after a short minut monica  our server reappear and we request a minut or two to scan the vast select rang from sweet to savori 
i was quit excit scan thru select and decid what my tast bud were long for i chose the oven bake omelet with spinach and feta which come with a serious putrid mushroom sauc on the sidery toast and a side of their famous smoke bacon my son chose the egg benedict we also had a accompani of 3 buttermilk pancakes
her is where is get scary
th wait for our breakfast was a tad longer then anticip approx 20 min but not to the point of frustrat  
after monica brought our meal to us we were excit to dive in base sole on our past experi with pancak cafe 
on my first glanc at my plate i had notic my omelet was dark and dri and sad was the 3 strip of bacon 495 was cold anoth sad set in the rye toast had a burnt edg not dark but burnt and was surpris this was bypass and serv anyway this toast was like two dri piec of cement chisel off of a highway median sad the rest of the meal digress just as rapid as the first impressions
th side of pancak reek and tast of the griddl oil the hash brown were fri upon and the whip butter possess that old tast which accompani dairi good left too long exposed
thi is the real kicker
mi son egg benedict were a laughabl excus for authent and poor execut befor he even cut into the poach egg sit upon his ham slice and soggi muffin we notic that the bright yellow obvious packet made hollandais was coagul and stiff i was shock but then even after that first impress he cut into this tradit breakfast entre expect that gorgeous flow from the golden yolk but  ala that moment never happen the yolk were hard cooked
thi was just too laughabl at this point we will post photo of this exact meal soon 
so all in all servic was okay food was a huge disappoint bad coffeeand horribl sweet syrup for a pancak place you would think they would have real mapl syrup so so sad we were veri disappoint 
 if you are search for qualiti food for a great breakfast  i would high rethink befor you decidi had eaten at the old scottsdal locat of oregano mani time in order to have a larger build the old town locat move a while back i gave the new build a few chanc i just cant continu to go there the place is now such a cave you can tell they did as littl as possibl to get the place open but that not what realli seal the deal i actual have stop go to oregano all togeth sinc they chang their pasta supplier the new pasta has a terribl consist and is veri gummi i had been go to oregano for about 15 year but the chang that have been made recent have stop me from go to all locat it sad that it use to be my favorit restaur but when they seem to have trade qualiti for profit it no
long the place it use to bewent to los sombrero begin of april 2009 right when they open around 500 pm  had babi in carrier with husband  we usual sit at the bar outsid but with the babi we want to be seat on patio  

we ate chip and salsa  dont like the littl dorito wheel that come wedg in the chip basket  the salsa are just alright and the tini bowl arent big enough for even the two of us

got crab queso  it was good we fill up on that and when my husband carnita use to be our fav came so did the fli  yea the regular dumpster varieti  ilk  we were surround by about 20 fli  they were land on the food and us and bite  the servic was poor  we final got her to come over and we want to pack up the food and get out of there  i had fish  oh yea and a margarita  they seem  fine but on we go

th waitress notic the fli and shoo them away while she gave us the to go box  our bill was about 70 with tip  

we didnt eat the rest of our leftov that night  but the next night we warm up the carnita and ate it up  it seem fine  the next morn we woke up with sever vomit and diarrhea  this last for 2 day  i went to the er and had to get 3 liter of salin from dehydr  now we think this all came from the carnita  perhap we should have not eaten it a day later  mayb it was on it last leg the night they serv it and that extra dayit turn bad  we cant be sure  stomach flu has been go around so it could have been that  thing is we both got sick at the exact same moment  hummm wont be go back  ever  sadi will start by say the smallest tip i have left in 10 year famili just move to phoenix and we were recommend to come here mani issu with this place
1 terribl servic  we liter had to ask for more water and anoth cocktail more than onc and we had to beg for our check tabl next to us was ask the same thing  she ask 3 time for their check 
2 food was bad carnita was plain plain plain my wife enchilada was cold 
3 price were ridicul for my wife and i to have enchilada dinner chees carnita dinner guacamol with chip and 2 margarita was 6570 befor tip that insaneoh yeah dinner took 1 hr and 15 min at a mexican restaur 

diner bewarto celebr our 25th wed anniversari we chose the palm  in the past the dinner have been except  but not this timeit was a quiet night and we chose to be seat near the back where onli one other tabl was occupi  the waiter arriv took our drink and food order and disappear  but onli disappear from our tabl sinc he was more interest in the 10 top near by  our food was deliv by the back waiter and the head waiter never came back to check to see if we were happi with our meal  if he had we could have told him that my husband medwel bone in ribey was under cook on one side and over cook on the other end  i could have share with him that the 6 lb lobster i order was still raw in two area  we tri to get his attent to no avail

sinc my husband know i hate to make a scene and sinc it was our anniversari he didnt want to spoil it ani further  we did see the waiter for the second time when he drop the bill at our tabl  we put the 450 cash in the folder and proceed to leav  his tip was the balanc from 432more than he deserv  but he had the nerv to say that what you are leav me old man  my husband who work in the industri said he should think about his servic  we are excel tipper 25 40 and the could confirm that with brian or carlo  this waiter ruin our 25th wed anniversari dinner embarrass my husband and my son was furious

a we exit my son ask us to step out as we spoke with mckenzi  he heard  im sorri  

when we return home my husband call the restaur and spoke at length with mckenzi   mckenzi took down the inform and promis us the fb manag would call us the next day

guess what that call should have been receiv on april 16 and on april 29 2014 and no phone call   i cant tell you how disappoint we are  we will onli have one 25th wed anniversari dinner and it was ruin by your staff and manag  i cant imagin whi your manag staff did not address the situationi then wrote a detail email to the corpor offic and no respons to date on june 10  i call them and they said they never receiv it even though i confirm the email address  i guess palm las vega has learn it lack of custom servic from corporate

whil im sure there is noth you can do at this late date i want you to know of the fail of this restaur   certain not the qualiti of servic i would expect from the palmcame here for brunch for my birthday weekend and it was a total fail it rare to say that yelp has total disappoint me on this one

 i got the steak and frite bordelais the frite were good but i got tire of it so quick becaus it was too salti the steak was not even that great it had way too much sweet flavor go on on such a thin slice steak
mi friend got the broccoli and chees crepe and it was gross
 anoth friend got the tuna melt sandwich the present of this dish was nice but it was also gross all i could tast was the oliv and i hate oliv 
mi other friend got the quich and it was noth special 
the onli good dish was the prime steak sandwich with au jus sauc but i have had better in oc

th servic was eh our server was slow and rare check up on us  this restaur is overhypdrop by with a group of friend on 61209  the bouncer told us there was a cover charg of 20 which we didnt expect  we had check out the websit prior to go  a friend show the bouncer the websit on his phone which clear read never a cover  this should convinc him right

nop he then tell us their polici chang 2 week ago but the websit isnt updat yet  it take over 2 week for the venetian to chang a few word on a webpag  i dont think so

i dont care if i need to pay cover but this was shadi enough for me to walk away  there plenti of other place to goto in vega anywaygross  manki manki manky

i had to stay here for four night cos somebodi forgot to book our room earli for ces  the first night there were yucki cur black hair on the bathroom floor and a larg stain on the carpet

day two  came back to my room to realiz that they didnt chang the sheet just made the bed ok that fine by me realli  as long as they chang sheet between guest  i have my doubt  took a brief nap befor the even festiv and when i awok  unwis made closer inspect of bed i was in  there was a crusti substanc im tri to convinc myself it was cream of mushroom soup on my blanket  not the gross bedspread i alway pull off the bed  my blanket yuk yuk yuk

day three  b report that there was dri blood on one of his fresh towel  eeeewwww

day four  im sick  i blame the room

and they charg 12 for everi 24 hour of wireless

th onli redeem qualiti was the so bad it was good loung act the first night

im a littl bitterafter watch top chef and have alreadi been to michael voltaggio stellar restaur the dine room my wife and i had been look forward to tri tom colicchio craftsteak for sever month so the first thing we did when arriv at vega was make reservations

il mention a few thing my wife and i are both under 30 and we were a parti of two ive alway felt that if you realli want to know how good a restaur truli is you visit as a parti of two ani restaur in the world will bend over backward to make a big parti happi server know that more peopl  bigger tip but when a restaur treat a coupl well you know that they have class 

sad to say this was the most classless fine dine experi that weve ever had we would have complain to the manag had they been anywher to be found ala yelpcom get the suprem pleasur of hear the brutal truth  have fun with this guysgals

first for 110 a person you can eat like a king in vega the food here was edibl but so is the food at ani 30 buffet in town you come to a place like this for top notch servic and mindblow food  craftsteak fail at both

servic 15

as mani yelper have suggest the servic here is almost nonexist until you are fill out the tip line on the check when it becom patron we wait near 20 minut befor one of our four server even bother to ask us if we want to get drink  and anoth 20 minut befor they ask if we want to order with four server youd think that a parti of two would be abl to place a drink and food order within a half hour

now befor you think that this was intent polit on their part nobodi like to be urg to order right away at a nice restaur this wasnt that  this was them be near oblivi to the fact that we were in the restaur in the first place which is odd becaus we made reserv and were seat front and center in the middl of the dine room 

still optimist we ask for an explan about how the restaur prefer to serv it guest  but instead of be offer a clear explan of the menu the waiter rambl off a near incoher sentenc or two about how we should realli just order from the chef tast menu ok thank for noth  we are at craftsteak we know that were here for the chef tast menu we came to spend

20 more minut pass befor the next of our waiter arriv he again advis us on the chef tast menu we urg him to explain the tast menu and final we got an explan  which would have been great except that he got his number complet mix up he explain that each guest receiv 2 salad tast 2 meat tast and 2 side tast our math said that meant 6 differ tast per person  12 total  anoth yelper mention 16 plate of food per coupl so that sound about right 

we wait anoth 15 befor anyon came back to take our order

th third waiter show up like the friggin hero of the day we proceed to place our order he inform us that we have everyth wrong  you onli get 1 of each tast select which is kinda funni  becaus it defeat the purpos of the tast menu if you are just go to serv massiv famili size portion of a few thing but whatev we order the tast menus the wagyu beef version which were 130person

about 30 second pass befor we did a littl math and realiz that we were actual pay quit a bit more for the tast menu than if we had just order ala cart for the item that we want to tri thank to our fellow yelper bisqu quail yukon pure filet etc

throughout the meal server rare came to the tabl to check on us servic was tacki although they were so pretenti that someon might confus it for them be fanci cmon yelper  it not fanci to leav cold uneaten bread on the tabl for the entir meal when you have the main cours out it not fanci to leav the clean empti wine glass on the tabl when we are on our second round of cocktail fine dine establish are care to manicur the eat process this felt like i was at tgif friday server bumbl around break 2 wine glass and hope no one saw we had dirti finish plate of food in front of us for the major of the meal my drink sat empti for no less than 25 minut 

i could go on but yelp limit me to 5000 letter  

food  25
the ribey was tasti but thin and cover in fat and gristl the filet was overcook the lobster bisqu tast like it was dous in fennel seed the quail onion and yukon were good the rest was mediocr at best again  it was edibl but for 110 per person my jaw should be in my lap wors no ever check on us despit 270 of food be on the tabl 

save your cash  or better  use it for a plane to la and visit the dine room we left disappointit took me a while to write this review becaus i realli didnt know what to say  this was one of the worst dine experi i have had in some time  

first the good
th bread free is pretti cute it come out on it own littl pantray stuck togeth like king hawaiian rolls

th okay
green bean were averag some slice almond were ad for crunch
spinach was averag cook in garlic oil
warm frise salad the bacon was good the huge glob of uncook egg were a bit strang though  i enjoy it overal becaus it was differ from the usual type of salad

th bad
steak was well done and we ask for medium rare    
servic there was consist a group of waiter stand about 10 feet from us but no one ever came by to check on us  about 25 minut after our steak came to our tabl a woman not our main server came by and ask how our food was  we explain that it was overcook and she said oh  she didnt offer to take it back and replac it she didnt offer a discount or a freebi she didnt offer a sorri  

i just dont think that a steak restaur can offer bad steak  mayb becaus it vega they just depend on onetim custom and not repeat busi i can say with confid that i wont be back anytim soonwe just left this horribl establish 

i call to see if they had open tabl tonight 91813 
i was told no problem come on over 

it is my father inlaw birthday we want a nice dinner 

when we arriv the ladi look us up and down and say we have to wait and can eat at the bar i am not pay for a steak to eat at a bar

w wait over 20 minut the hostess seat other tabl and then lie to us and said the comput system was down after anoth 10 minut we left 

im not sure whi she felt we were not worthi of a table

what i do know is that i was complet disrespect and embarrass at this restaur i will never go back and will relay my experi to mani otherwhat a joke whoever recommend this place for happi hour must be smokin some serious crack 6 for spinach artichok dip guess what it the same price on the regular menu the other choic are onli 1 off and are most fri option lame 

i was tempt to order the strawberri salad with feta but for 9 i can certain make that at home i was tempt to tri the kobe burger with blue chees and appl but my waistlin didnt need it nor could i talk myself into spend 12 on a piec of meat slap between two bun no way 

as for the beer uhm excus me while i roll my eye you wont find ani tap here that becaus they serv onli bottl and not mani of them appar best youll find here is a heineken im asham to admit it but i went with the calori counter swillwat known as michelob ultra it was 2 dure hh i had to forc myself to drink it 

instead of stay and endur the wreck atmospher and abysm beer select my pal and i opt to pay for our drink and go somewher els somewher far better 

what a wast of time

that it this place is now offici renam which do you prefer vote now with your cell phone keypad 

press 1 for bunganono 
2 for bunganoway 
3 for bungaloser
4 for bungalami cant believ this place has such good review  i went here for my bachelorett parti and had to deal with the most scumbag of a waiter and the most incompet manag ever  if i could give this place no star i would

i told the waiter that it was my bachelorett parti and ask if he had ani suggest  he said he didnt even though we found out later that they had a tast menu  this would be nice to offer a bachelorett parti  we ask him what was on the boat and he couldnt realli tell us and said he would check with the chef  he came back about 10minut later and told us he couldnt understand what the sushi chef were say becaus they didnt speak english veri well  are you kid me  you should not be work in a japanes restaur if you cannot communic with the sushi chef  tell a bunch of asian that your chef cannot speak english is border on be racist  whi dont you tri a littl harder next time sinc this is your job

h was bare present through out our whole meal and i was so upset that i call the manag over  the manag was useless  he did not see what the waiter did wrong mayb he was racist as well and did not offer to do anyth extra for us  

when the bill came i tri to paid it with my credit card  the scumbag waiter came back and told me that my card was declin  how embarrass did  he make me feel  i found out later when i call my credit card that it was never declin  what a scumbag  he was do it out of spite

thi is the wors restaur i have ever dine at  the food doesnt even matter becaus the servic was so horribl  if shibuya was in nyc it would not stand a chanc becaus new yorker will not put up with this type of subpar servic at a fine dine establish  there are ton of restaur in vega and this one is not worth your aggreva truli horribl experi and a complet wast of 100 pp 
the problem begin quick with rude unattent servic failur to bring drink prompt failur to bring extra plate failur to even have chopstick on the tabl failur to bring prepar sushi on time 
the food the lobster miso is frank gross the roll small and outrag price even for vega and all of em fell apart as we tri to eat them  i know mgm is hurt financi and have drastic even cut back comp to  a bare minimum but come on 1617 for a  sashmi salad their signatur roll is horribl  the saki price though were avg for vega but you need sever bottl just to choke down the pork we order be a 20 yr mlife member  i believ this is our most disappoint experi everthis review is base strict off their custom service

mi wife and i were go out for dinner last night at muramoto  we arriv earli 530p to the king street area  so we thought we would stop by nat spil for a coupl predinn cocktail  neither of us had been there befor and were excit to give it a try

our initi take was we realli like the atmosher  seem veri cool  howev as mention in other review we soon found that the place was small and a littl confus for us  the place has about 10 tabl that i could see and a small bar with about 12 stool  is it a restaur or a bar  the reason i bring this up is that when we walk in there were two coupl sit at tabl and no one at the bar  one coupl had food and other coupl just had cocktail  there was no one to greet us when we walk in i didnt think that was go to be a big deal but it obvioulsli was so we saunter over to the bar and order a cocktail  after the drink were pour we thought it might be more comfort sit at a tabl and told the bartendress  no problem she says

w chose a tabl in the front window area  it was small but had four set of silverwar  sudden a waiter appear and ask if it just the two of us tonight  yes i repli  he let out a big sigh and then snatch two of the silverwar set  as he is walk to the cupboard to put them away i notic that he is shake his head the whole time and is still visibl piss that there is onli two of us  he then take the silverwar he just clear and start slammingthrow  them back into the cupboard drawer  

let me take the opportun to remind you that there were four other custom in this establish at this point and it was 530pm  it not like we were occupi prime seat dure prime time  

so the waiter come back and say what do want for dinner  with an exagger roll of his eye   i said we were just have drink and wouldnt be stay long  anoth hugh sigh and he storm off to his station and take a big drink from his wine glass  i was surpris to see the waiter drink at 530  i wonder if he paid for that drink or if it was stolen from the establish owner

wel that pretti much seal it  not go to have a second drink there  we slam our cocktail and high tail it  as we were leav we had to walk right past him  he never look up or even acknowledg we were leav  

interest enough around 800p as we were walk back to our car from muramoto we glanc into the front window of nat spil  it look they had a whoop crowd of about 6 peopl  i wonder how mani other peopl left after deal with that assbag waiterthere seem to be two differ experi here the one that most peopl have had and then the one my friend and i had i have no problem spend money on good food and drink but i was hard press to spend 85 on brunch that had the word buffet in it when juli k had post a talk thread inform us of the groupon reserv 2 for 99 i jump on it figur there wouldnt be better time to tri it made a reserv for 1030 arriv on time and was seat an hour later an hour i guess they figur my time isnt valuabl i couldv slept in longer final we were seat but didnt have our drink order taken for anoth 10 minut as we were sit there i was notic the decor i felt like i was in a cosbi show episod the ambianc was veri strang 80s theme all the way start out at the station with the broil lobster tail seem to look good they were split in half so i grab a coupl these were decent but noth spectacular i skip the carv station as im not a huge meat eater so i cant comment on that the entir warm station was set up like a cater type deal all the food is in a metal flip top with fire under neath so all the food had that harden layer on top not appet at all went over to the sushi station order hamachi and tako when i got to the tabl i notic how hard the fish was i wasnt brave enough to tri it the caviar was scoop from a bucket type thing i gave it a tri but spit it out it was so warm i tri the oyster which were stack on a plate sit on ice again when i return to the tabl i notic how smelli they were so i was too nervous to tri them all the while we were bare check on my our server we had mayb 3 refil of pj that basic the best part of the meal so far we end up eat most crab leg and a few crab claw the dessert were compar to costco we tri the creme brûlée ehh it give me no pleasur to complain about this entir mealexperi but i cannot see how this was a great experi from anyon we tip on the full amount so this still was a 70 meal this was a huge disappointthe skinni textur offens cafeteria food that had probabl sat in a chafe dish all day 1 low cut fauxgerman dairi maid costum doe not constitut servic unless you are at a strip club 2 overal valu can onli be justifi if youv had way too much to drink 1

hofbrauhaus is a disneyworldesqu germanstyl build close to hard rock hotel i want to tri this place out for a while becaus of the charm facad outside

w decid to head there to eat becaus it was in my head that it would be like a minitrip to a sanit germani without the pricetag 

when we enter the place has the tire ambienc of a hangov  complet with the loud cacophoni of a bad german folk band nobodi was sing along with music danc or laugh just down a bunch of beer one after another

our waitress came by and took our order dress to err impress she soon lost interest in our tabl howev when we told her we werent interest in alcohol order a diet cokepepsi which was not onli flat but also tast like there was some root beer mix in there too

i order the sauerbraten which is suppos to be a roast pork dish with dumpl veget and red wine sauc with red cabbag we were surpris at how quick the food came out of the kitchen after we tast our food  we knew why

th food obvious was sit under a heat lamp for way too long someon tri to disguis over dri salti pork with an overabund of a lumpi thick red wine gravi the dumpl were larg gummi and unappet veget were overcook the onli thing that was okay on the dish was the stew red cabbage

mi husband schnitzel was dri and soggi the gravi it was swim in was bland the potato salad was unpleas sour and over warm

thi place is not cheap  a typic entre can be around the 20 mark  yet they do not provid you ani valu for your dollar given the qualiti of the ambienc servic and foodi just left here tonight is my 30th birthday and although the food was great the servic is what i have come to expect from vega absolut shit  our server one of their best didnt give a fli fuck about our tabl  i dont need a candl or a birthday song but embarrass my famili and i will be compel to call you out the band was great too but our blond server never smile onc and made my famili who tri so hard to give me a good time feel like assholes

thank and happi birthday to mewtf this is a complet knockoff of father offic in la

cheat 

how unorigin and typic of phoenix

isnt this illigal

httpwwwfathersofficecomhtmlfathersofficehtmlok peopl let stop be sheep here delux is noth but an extrem overpr low qualiti burger place peopl are stuf in here like cattl the fact that so mani peopl rave about delux is just anoth thing i dont understand i tri this place twice i will alway tri a place twice in case they have an off day and i was veri veri disappoint both time the burger i order was 11 eleven dollar folk no burger no matter how incred is worth anywher near 11 and of cours this did not come with frys or anyth els the burger was kinda mushi with no flavor at all the bun was veri plane and did not have the best textur i also order the sweet potato frys and did not like them at all that was the first time i had ever had those so it could be i just dont like that type of french fri the second time i order the regular frys and they were pretti undercook with no season 
    this place prove my theori if you make it snooti enough everyon will think it good matter how bad the food is delux is noth but hype if you want to tri a real burger with great flavor and a descent price tri lenni on thunderbird and 35th ave that what a burger should tast likeugggghh what can i say about chino bandido

it a shit hole on 19th and greenway in a dumpi shop center

th food isnt realli that good and the place is not clean
mi friend rave about this place so i went with him i even order his suggest some chicken bowl thing  the chicken was grizzli and the serv wasnt even that big for what i drop  

i think the idea of the place is cute but the execut isnt there  i mean a filiberto or a cheap chines joint destroy this place and you could buy a burrito and a chines combo at both togeth for onli a few dollar more than a combo at chino bandito

i just do not understand whi peopl like this placei wonder what sampl jan d receiv if they had given me sampl it would have save me 874 becaus i would have run out the door right after the first bite

i think the place everyon els ate at has been replac and i found myself at the new chino bandido a shit dump that serv food that tast wors than if a panda express threw up on del taco i should have known this would be a disast if guy fieri has been here when is his 15 minut up everi time i go somewher that guy fieri has featur on diner drivein and dive it alway turn out to be one of the worst place i have ever been guy fieri know as much about food as mcdonald doe first i didnt even get what i order they make a huge deal about how to order how about get the order right what they gave me couldnt have been more opposit to what i order i order black bean and plain fri rice they gave me refri bean and pork fri rice or some fri rice that was contamin with a pseudo disgust meatlik product i order a jade red burrito they gave me someth with slimi pork insid and i ask for a veggi quesadilla they gave me a quesadilla with gross fatti chicken and a horribl sauc the bag was fill with greas even on the bottom of it it made a bag from five guy look healthy

i guess for some it is a novelti to mix asian and mexican if you realli want to enjoy such fusion head to vega and tri china poblano the creation of jose andr if you are drunk or high between the hour of 11 am and 9 pm and in phoenix and you have a need to consum a pile of shit this place will satisfi such a cravewe have heard about this place for a long time from friend and famili everybodi love it
mi question is whi whi the hype is it becaus of guy fieri
mi husband and i are veri adventur foodi we are also veri creativ cook 
this was not good mexican food this was not good chines food get the two togeth and it was horribl food truli the worst food we have ever had in the valley i think peopl are go for it cuz it trendi pleeeeasmy girlfriend and i came in around noon on monday for lunch i purchas one lunch pass and use a comp through myvega card for the second pass the cashier rang it up as two transact the first through the myvega pass and the second on my credit card

onc seat our server took our drink order and look at my receipt she then claim that i had onli paid for one person and need to buy anoth pass i point out that i use a comp for one person and paid use my credit card for the second henc the reason whi i receiv two receipt  she then instruct us to stay seat until she got someon els to look at it

a few minut later our server brought who i assum was a supervisor that said the same thing i repeat the same stori and point out our cashier and told them to ask her the supervisor then ask if she could see our comp ticket to prove my stori at this point i was get visibl frustrat sinc it couldv been easili solv if they walk 30ft to ask the cashier i told them my comp ticket was taken by the cashier but i had two receipt each show a pass for each person

eventu they brought over the manag to the tabl he ask what the problem was and the server told him that i onli bought one pass befor i could get a word in he told the server that he saw me use a comp and buy anoth pass for my girlfriend  he then show the waiter how on one receipt it show comp and other where i paid   without apolog the waiter final said we could get our food while she got us water  later on the supervisor came back and ask if we had bought anoth pass luckili the manag was within earshot and told her everyth was fine with our table

at that point we had complet lost our appetit  a small error made by the server couldv been realli resolv if she read our receipt proper or check with the cashier instead neither the waiter or supervisor did this and we were accus twice of onli pay for one person  our dine servic was fine after that she attempt to overcompens by ask us if our tabl was too wobbl or if she could bring us addit silverwar  not much wouldv to made up the experi to us at that point

w didnt seem to be the onli tabl to be have issu as anoth tabl a few row over was accus of the same thing by a differ waiter  the same supervisor came over and told them that they had to vacat their seat this tabl had alreadi gotten their food and are forc to get up hold their plate and tri to resolv the situat  the entir group was visibl upset as a coupl of them went back to their cashier to get her to resolv the problem the same manag resolv the situat quick but at this point their tabl was given to anoth parti  so a group of four peopl stood at the front of the buffet each carri a full plate of food wait until anoth tabl open up

how was the food i dont know you couldv feed me gruel and i wouldnt have been abl to tell a differ  we left in less than half an hour and didnt even finish three plate between the two of us i guess be accus multipl time of tri to cheat the buffet kill the mood and our appetitthis review is base sole on our most recent visit 27april2014 to this buffet  be a las vega local i expect much more for the amount of money we spent to eat here my wife and i decid to celebr our 13th wed anniversari and  treat ourselv to someth a bit fancier than the local casino have to offer  i read the review prior to go and still made a conscious decis to take my wife here shame on me as i was forewarn as soon as we arriv we were greet by a hispan host who was just shuffl peopl no greet no welcomeno noth just a how mani  after pay approx 78 for 2 of us we were seat in a back corner by a ladi who appear to be from the african contin base by her accent  this seat area ad a realli bad stench in the area i immedi ask if we could move to anoth area and point to much better lit and cleaner area she was veri blasé and state that area is close  she didnt offer to seat us elsewheresh just continu on to the next group of peopl 

after be seat we head to the food counter and found a delight assort of food with my mouth water i began to pile on the food to take back to our unaccept booth the food was lack with that pop of flavor that one would expect when pay this much for dinner the food was bland mere warm and after 2030 have dinner i felt nauseous for a coupl hour i want to make it clear this was not from over eat  to sum it up the execut chef at this buffet who over see the qualiti of the food are not worth a damn shame on them for let crap be serv to tourist and visitor that come to our beauti citi and then leav with an experi as my wife and i experienc we will not be go back  by far this buffet should not be on the top 10 list to tri i understand that the next person experi may be differ due to differ peopl work differ shiftsbut the lack of qualiti to the foodther is just no excus  i truli feel bad for someon vacat here spend so much jus to eat and go back to their home think of a negat experi of our citiavoid this place like the plagu how this place was vote best in vega 2007 is besid me the spice market manag to f up food i thought was fail proof the beef tenderloin tast like it was boil in water sushi dri and hard crab leg salti and wateri i lost my appetit one plate in which was one plate too muchi wouldnt return

expens not veri expans just becaus you have a lot of space doesnt mean you are serv a lot of food and the food was standard hometown buffet quality

for the money they charg i expect to be eat good food  noth stood out as greatmayb the breakfast sausag  sausag is absolut imposs to screw up

th potato tast like recycl egg carton  well i guess it good that they are recyclingright

go to ani of the other 356 good buffet in the land of stripper liberac and buffetthe worst experi at a buffet ive had in a long time from begin to end 

the girlfriend and i visit becaus we had a groupon probabl should have been the first hint and and we didnt feel like cook we read the review befor we bought the groupon i just thought the bad review came from those who were a littl too picki i was wrong so we went with a clear mind will to give this place everi chanc it deserv 

servic scale from 15 where 5 is excel  1

we arriv and walk up to the cashier boy she must have been have a bad day not the attitud i expect from a restaur no smile no hospit whatsoev kinda made me feel like i want want there anyway i got over it we stood and wait for the host to show us to the tabl her attitud was not much better ugh not a good start we wait about five minut befor our server came and took our drink order i swear there must be a theme to this restaur or someth she look like she was bare toler of our exist expect so the worst servic i have ever experienc we hard saw here throughout the dinner even when she saw us wave her over she would ignor it 

food  2

now let get to the food ohth food the onli thing that was good there were the crab leg the shrimp cocktail and the charcuteri that becaus you cant realli mess that up everyth els was just downright bad the prime rib was complet overcook and tough the babi back rib were overcook and hard the bread they serv were rock hard pretti much noth in their hot station that we had were veri appet we hate to wast food but sad most of the plate that we got were full when they took it away we read that the save grace is the dessert station not necessarili well they do have frozen custard which is the best thing there they also have a macaron cooki which was done pretti well they have mayb ten varieti of cupcak and are way too sweet in my opinion the fruit tart stale the crepe in the crepe station are premad packag 

valu  4

i give this a four given that the deal was from groupon 35 for two peopl alcohol includ 

all in all a pretti horribl experi which prompt me to leav a review i think they should serious look into the servic part of the establish it can make or break an experi and on this occas it shatter it beyond repairwas there today and the staff made it a pretti miser experi  

first of all the food is overpr and just okay  ten dollar for a turkey sandwich and some leav that didnt do much for me  

but the servic was atroci  the waiter couldnt have been less interest in his job  i drank two arnold palmer and ask for a third the third time he seem like id ask him for a kidney and said we dont refil those  so i could have had 10 diet coke or 10 ice tea for that matter but not anoth arnold palmer  

second i had a fifth member of the parti join us late  the waiter advis us to take a chair from a differ tabl  an old friend sit down and were get caught up when the manag come and make a huge fuss over it  if im conscienti and ask for permiss for someth like that im expect not to get admonish for it ten minut later  as we were near done with our meal anyway the manag should have let it go  

waiter cap it off by twice forget a to go box forc anoth member of my parti to simpli give up on bring their food homewhen in las vega it implicit that your go to drop a chunk of chang even for a goddamn bottl of water so it no surpris that the fanci restaur at the hottest casino in las vega cost 175 a head for the world most underwhelm meal

stil this place doe not get a pass and here why

1 walk in it smell like low tide i was pretti drunk when we got here so not know this was a seafood joint whisper okay mayb said loud to my friend obvious dont order ani of the seafood 

2 the servic is ridicul it like amateur night over there all this postur and kowtow for what omar the manag came over to check on us but did noth use we were a parti of 12 it was my brother birthday the bill was over 1500 and we got nuttin no from the chef no on the hous just a chatti sommeli with noth to offer except a long stori about his commut 

3 the food was fine noth except justfin their angl is they fli the fish in everi day from the mediterranean we got the orata and some other name i cant rememb serious guy im not some chump whos like yeah food tast like food it all the same this food tast like food the whole mediterranean thing was such a gimmick gross me out big time

sav your money or go to one of the star chef spot like thoma keller bouchon las vega or daniel boloud brasseri at wynn las vegas

honest i wouldv been happi as a clam at high tide to get mediocr room servic and drop that money at a blackjack tabl it would have been a much more satisfi wast of moneycons
long wait with tabl empty
slowest servic i have ever seen
wait staff almost nonexistent
had to get their attent everi singl time
food averagesom item good
bread was cold and came out after an hour sit at the table
pepp and salt just set on the table
worst servic i have ever seen at a restaur at this price point
should have stay in los angel and gone to mateo or anoth in bever hill to get great food and excel servic at half the price

r we are begin to think this bad servic is intentionalit is that bad 

am i get punk 

feel like im on boil pointwher are the camera i know they are just wait on us to walk out 

havent eaten at a restaur with servic like this in year it is almost comicalalmost 

how did the new york time rate this as the best restaur in vega is this the same restaur honest im rather disgust by this establish 
oh let me clarifi the food is edibl and the decor is nice it everi other element that overrid ani miniscul inkl of a redeem qualiti 

this place reek of pretenti snobberi do i have a nomin for understat of the year award everi encount with a human be at bartolotta was pathet from the host to the staff fill water and especi to the waiter my famili and i were treat as if we were 20th class citizen while dine here we were all dress appropri and arent slob obvious howev when we didnt bite on the waiter offer for the severalhundr dollar special of the night his demeanor flip a 180 and we were legitim treat less than an ugli sweater at a thrift shop  

and to add extrem insult to injuri the price are more ridicul than tri to get through rush hour on the strip my famili and i realli enjoy fine dine typic in vega so we were prepar for the extrem price tag that typic come with the higherend dine howev the cash to qualiti ratio here just doesnt do it at all 

realli this is all you need to know horribl servic and subpar food for the price a price that could probabl feed ethiopa until 3013 unless you own a money tree and find joy in sit in a restaur bask in the ambianc of other pompous egotist shallow individu avoid bartolottai heard good thing about diego happi hour  had it in my radar for awhil onli thing keep me from come sooner is as with all restaur in the mgm it not easi to get to them park in the garag then walk through the star lane shop then the casino then the long hallway through restaur row well it was memori day weekend  a friend and i were feel motiv to make the trek i had call ahead to make sure they were still do happi hour on sunday i spoke with a realli nice hostess who inform me they were actual do happi hour from 2530 normal hh is 4530 in honor of memori day we got there at 4 sat down at the bar and ask for a hh menu the bartend say my mgr stop hh at 4 i told him that i had just call and spoke with a hostess who inform me differ he repli  do you want to take it up with my mgr i said sure so he leav to go get the mgr when he return he say to us i dont feel like chase  him around so i guess i will just honor it and proceed to toss us a menu i notic onli drink on the menu and i ask if there was a food hh menu he said no i show him a pictur of the onlin hh menu from their websit and he just shrug his shoulder and said i dont know from this point on he was a complet jerk to us cesar is his name he act like we were a bother to him he would speak spanish to the other bartend in front of us which is total unprofession we end up order a pitcher of margarita which werent good at all and some nacho that made up for the margarita but for 12 they should be good as the portion was small 

i have no toler for peopl who are in the custom servic industri and act like this you are a bartend i get we all have bad day but no excus to be total jerk to your custom you lost two custom and i will for sure tell my friend to avoid this placeim so upset to have to rate this restaur so low and it is all becaus of manag what could of been an excel dine experi was ruin by the goon they have as manag there are a lot of restaur that treat their employe like crap even when those said employe are veri pleasant to the guest it anoth whole differ thing when they bulli and derat their staff in front of custom especi custom that are pay a hefti price for their meal i dont need to see that or hear manag grievanc with their employe the reason we go out is to enjoy our meal in a pleasant and relax atmospher  this was not

th even start with a chef  i am guess  yell at the bartend that was show me to the restroom yes in front of me no regard for a guest feel uncomfort i guess how he felt or what he need to air out was more import then a guest dine experi 

i decid to forget about it and just enjoy my even we had the grill octopus that was love and the wagyu tartar there were few interrupt to our meal with manag come to the bar look irat and speak to our bartend about one thing or anoth and it was obvious upset our bartend get yell at from time to time in front of us

w order the lobster that was overcook but the sweet corn flan was delici that came with it at this point 2 differ manag that look like 2 differ version of the incred hulk came behind the bar and were yell at her  the bartend she told us they were send her downstair becaus it was busi  she return and it seem like her and manag are have some kind of alterc   again in front of us she begin to cri  and told us they sent her home so we decid to get our check and leav although we were go to order more food
 we realli want to pay her for our tab so we can tip her but it seem like she had to leav now  we final get her over there to take her tip money befor she leav  horribl experi one of the manag said he was go to take care of us for the rest of the night by this time we were so disgust with their unprofession behavior that we want to leav and never return and we told him  that as well  he proceed to say that she should have not behav like that i am sorri you are a manag you should not behav like that you should have the tact and profession that your tittl impli instead you have no regard for your guest and their experi you have a problem with your employe take care of it behind close door not while i am eat my 7000 dollar lobster this was a veri slow even on top of it and they have 2 unprofession manag on that a joke the worst dine experi i have had in a long time if ever 

later i speak to other that wit the same kind of behavior in the past i dont believ a place like this should be support by anyon especi if you work in the industripicasso not the painter restaur in las vega is an absolut embarrass to the michelin star rate system  i would bet the farm that bellagio paid the michelin inspector a larg sum of money to get their 2 star  picasso doe not merit even 116 of a star compar to some of the michelin star restaur i have had the pleasur to dine in la sf nyc pari barcelona and london   

mi wife brought me here for my birthday and i was look forward in experienc their desgust menu  the pansear scallop tast like if they were from the same kitchen make the scallop salad for room serviceveri dri and bland in flavor  the halibut was dri and lack ani flaki textur  the lamb had no flavor whatsoev  i even forgot what i had for dessert  

i will admit that the servic was veri good  the waiter were attent and stir up good convers with us  the actual picasso paint were beauti and i realli enjoy view them  i come to vega a lot so the bellagio fountain dont realli thrill me anymor  howev i can see how most peopl would find this to be interest for their dine experi  

if you have experienc at least a 1 michelin star restaur picasso will disappoint you  i would avoid this restaur at all cost and use your money for the tabl instead  i will never dine here again or let ani of my famili or friend dare make a reserv at picassotwo word overr and overpriced

julian serrano you disappoint me  i had high expect of picasso in the bellagio especi sinc i read such amaz yelp review  howev my experi was anyth but 

sinc they were book for the week of new year we were onli abl to score a reserv for nye i was a bit disappoint becaus that meant that we would have to spend an addit 35 per person for the same menu they serv on regular day 

servic 
upon arriv the hostess told us our tabl was readi and sat us at the tabl farthest away from the water show  even upon ask to be move we were not move and the place was close to empti at first i thought it was becaus they were solid book up for the even but throughout our meal we saw that most of the tabl were open for a restaur with an amaz view i saw none of the water show this was extrem disappoint  

when our server came to introduc himself we ask a few question about the dish and he didnt realli know much about them when ask for suggest he just said all of the dish tast good  for a 2 michelin star restaur i expect the servic to be amaz and the server to be knowledg about the dish and be abl to give us some suggest  this was not the case  

from my past experi at michelin star restaur when our dish came the server would explain a littl bit about the dish and what we were eat  this didnt happen at picasso instead they just put the food on the tabl  in addit michelin star restaur are known for their servic we had crumb on the tabl from the bread and food and they never came over to clean it up  moreov we order lemonad for a drink and they never came over to ask if we want a refil bring out anoth one or even take the glass away just left the glass empti at our tabl 

what drastic hinder our fine dine experi was the photograph that picasso hire for the night or mayb it everi even  the ladi came by each tabl to take photo and ask for our name hotel and room number  she told us that she would deliv the photo to our room after our meal  i was annoy that she interrupt our first cours but sinc they were go to deliv the photo to our room i thought whi not  onli this was not the case the photo were not free she came back after we receiv our main cours and told us that the photo cost 140 for the packag 2 portfolio of 8x10s four 8x10s and 2 portfolio of wallet size four wallet or we could purchas each 8x10 portfolio for 40 and each wallet portfolio for 25 ad it up it would have been cheaper to purchas each portfolio separ rather than get the packag our photo were veri unprofession and were crumpl so we did not purchas them  i hand it back to our server and ask him to tell her we did not want it  she then came back interrupt our dinner for the third time and ask us if we were to purchas the photo  i had explain to her that we had given it to our server and would not like to purchas them  she ask whi and kept badger us to purchas them  never befor had we had such an aw experi at ani type of michelin star restaur be interrupt so mani time dure dinner and then badger and guilt trip into purchas photo we did not want 

food although i had read review about how amaz the food was at picasso our was onli mediocr  

what i order pan sear u10 day boat scallop sauté steak of a foie gras prime filet mignon and hazelnut joconde

what my friend order alaskan crab salad kobe sphere some kobe meatbal in a lentil sauc thing roast milkf veal chop and tropic napoleon

mi main cours was the prime filet mignon and i ask for it to be cook medium rare and it was cook to medium  the filet mignon lack flavor and was veri dri i had to ask a few time befor they brought out ani sauc   i end up eat onli a few bite and couldnt finish it becaus i was not enjoy it at all  

after be bother by the photograph we didnt want to eat our dessert and onli finish part of it becaus we were so annoy we didnt even get time to enjoy the picasso art   we came here to celebr graduat from graduat school but left high annoy and upset  

our dinner cost over 400 and we left extrem disappoint  i would not recommend picasso to anyon unless you want to spend big buck for mediocr food and servic  for such an expens meal i  much rather would have spent it on sever meal elsewher  weve been to julian serrano in the aria hotel and great enjoy our experi there more it is 15 of the cost and the server are much more knowledg and friend plus we were never hustl for photo or bother throughout our dinner therecafe lago is the worst buffet among all of harrah casino  yes even wors than imperi palac  for around 13 brucn at ip i didnt expect much but cafeteria food and it deliv good omelet  but for 25 at lago buffet i would at least expect  someth a littl just a littl more  but i got noth absolut noth  

there were veri few selectionsvarieti  italian station onli offer 4 differ pasta and look like can food  the carv station offer turkey and prime rib  the prime rib was not prime at all  my fianc ask for the end cut  it was so tough that he couldnt cut it with a regular knife  and guess what the server said they didnt have ani steak knife  the onli thing somewhat edibl was the roast chicken  

the salad station was pretti pathet no hard boil egg bean mushroom or celeri  what the heck  this is a buffet the least you could do is offer a descent salad bar  

there were 3 kind of sushi roll none i would even dare to touch  and the chines station had 3 dish  stir fri shrimp beef and fri rice  there were also 2 differ steam bun  and the dessert station had noth absolut noth that even look remot appet  give me a break

caesar is suppos to be the better if not best hotel among harrah chain but it has the worst restaur yes ive tri a few  lago buffet just prove it again  

if you must have buffet becaus you want to use your comp for food at harrah take my advis and go to rio  at least it edibl there  whoever is in charg of the restaur at caesar should be fire  whoever run the lago buffet at caesar should be kick in the athe 1star should actual read negat ten

run by scam artist to make a long stori short i order bottl servic they charg me sever time the price list on the menu claim i order from the dinner servic menu versus the bottl servic menu never mind that this was what they hand me and what i point to manag were rude unapologet and if it wasnt for the kickass cocktail waitress i wouldnt be sad if the entir place burn to the ground with everyon in it

also this is alleg an exclus memberson club this turn out to be a loos guidelin as the slimi bouncer were tri to wave ani skirt pass by through the door by the time we left the place was a douch factori 

douchebag go to hellwhi was i excit to go to the foundat room 1 use to be member onli mayb the onc exclus sound intrigu mayb this should have been a warn flag 2 love the view at mix and thought this might be anoth great one 3 receiv wrist band from a guy at mandalay bay that gave ladi host bar from 10pm12am and were told ladi were free and guy were reduc admiss for a steal at 20 

it was onli 930 so the husband and i walk around and drop some cash in the casino we made our way over to the entranc around 1030 no line just a few guy that work there we walk up to the dude work there and i inquir about the host bar he say we arent do that so i ask whi they would give me a wristband that clear say ladi host bar from 10pm12am and he repeat we arent do that so i ask if we can just both get in for free sinc this is clear a bait and switch situat he look at me like he doe not know what that phrase mean the husband say someth polit and we leav 

bottom line i am rate the door experi onli sinc i refus to pay for a hustl like that and you can get a great view and great servic at mix you can also get a great view of the strip from the voodoo loung there are way too mani great place and view in vega to deal with crap like that  i love mani of the restaur and bar at mandalay but this one sore miss the mark we will be drop our alcohol money elsewherwhen bait client no trick is too low

at the door i ask the bouncer if there was ani peopl up there he said it was but it would cost me 20 see no line whatsoev i was hesit but went along when i got up the place was dead 10 min later they close down becaus it so slow

il admit that the decor and view is good but a club that hustl client can never get more than a 1my mom and i both got the worst food poison here from the steak  avoid iti am uphaul i use to like this place until

i went there with a few peopl and we start to have a good convers with our waiter he was nice and outgoinga littl too outgoing

h quick share wit us that they advertis as no msg but they infact do use it  in all of the soup and dress and sauces

if they blaten lie about that what els do they do

bad ethic eith er use it and say you do which of cours would lose lot of busi or just take it out 

i couldnt believ this who can i report them to if you knowshow up at 705 pm on a thu night to use a groupon  they had some ridicul comedi show that was start at 8 pm and were requir ticket  the guy at the front door say sorri no groupon today it say there right on the door

m  the groupon say sunthu

him  the groupon also say not valid on special event  tonight is a special event

m  we check the websit befor we drove all the way down here just so we can get notifi at the door about a special event the websit doesnt say anyth about a special event tonight  we dont care about the comedi show we just want to use our grouponwel eat and get out of there befor the stupid comedi show starts

him  im sorri no

w storm out of there  what a shamw drove all the way to this dump just to be notifi at the door that it a special event  what kind of notif is that  if i wouldv known about this i wouldnt have purchas the stupid thing  i prompt email groupon and request a refund which they prompt gave to me within 12 hrs

ive been here befor to play pool and have a few beersbut no mas eli youv lost my business

return factor  0005after receiv 2 poor cook veal tbone the first i ask for medr and it came overcook and dri near burnt the 2nd attempt was sear rare as veal sashimi the owner came to my tabl and began to lectur me on how veal cant be cook between the 2 version that i had been given in fact the owner was rude disrespect and angri  he told me that i had no right to send back 2 steak and that i should leav  

mi friend and i complet shock and speechless stood up and walk out

i have been to this place a hand of time in the past and alway had adequ experi but to be treat this way as a custom is disgust and there is no excus for this poor behavior

what i will share with you is this restaur cater to an older demograph of guest  there are mani regular who visit this establish who are use to averag food below par servic and most like dont know ani better to distinguish from veri averag to a truli worthwhil dine experience

th owner waltz around brag and tell stori of his past and of itali some peopl may want to be in this kind of environ howev do not plan on go here if you want privaci as this place is veri small and lack the kind of romant italian ambianc that one who hope for  

if you are look for realli good food save your time and money  the food is averag at best  the price are not some great valu either  the averag entre price is just about 18 and appssalad are each about 9 on avg

truth there are better place to eat in the valley and there should never an instanc where a custom is treat so poor by an owner  

close your eye and imagin sear rear meat i have had sear tuna sashimi that was more cook than the steak that was brought to me  this is inexcus and poor execut  make me wonder who they have work in their kitchen

pretti disappoint epic failmy girlfriend and i came here for dinner on a friday night we were led to a tabl outsid and told our waiter would be with us in a few minut we proceed to sit there for over 20 minut while no one came to our tabl numer peopl were sat around us outsid and the host came outsid multipl time and seem to just stare at us we proceed to leav on our way out the host had the nerv to just look at me and say thank for come in with more than just a hint of attitud the servic at this place suck and the hipper than thou attitud is a joke stay awaycomplet pathet restaur i was with derrick when i went so refer his stori i would never come here again i wish place like this were ban from be in downtowni get it i get it everyon love fez and everyon love their sweet potato fri blah blah blah yes i agre the food is great i love their salad i love their pomagran margarita but you know what i love even more be acknowledg when i show up to spend my hardearn money at a restaur i hadnt been to fez for over a year becaus i had a horribl encount with the wait staff on a particular slow thurdsay night in decemb i brought an out of town friend for dinner becaus i had been rave about the food to her forev i was a regular i live in their hood i believ in support local restaur especi the great one so we show up veri few diner lot of wait staff we were prompt seat and then ignor for over 20 minut no water no silverwar no ill be with you in a minut noth so i was get piss i signal a server from across the room simpli to ask him who our server was and instead of come over he held up a finger to me to suggest i continu to wait and then he turn and continu to flirt with the guy he was talk to he wasnt even work he was chitchat so we got up and head for the exit as we pass he said are you guy leav um clear i havent been back doesnt matter how great the food is i work too hard and there are too mani other restaur in cenpho that need the support to wast my time and money on those who dont want to wast their time on me moral of the stori im done with fez i respect declin when my friend are all go and to their love credit and support they usual will go elsewher too although i know theyr sick of me tell the stori of whi fez is on my black list so kid spent your money elsewher sweet potato fri are a dime a dozenwe were seat right away but from there nobodi acknowledg us so we had to leav there were some waitstaff serv other nearbi but it felt like our tabl had nobodi assign to it we had to be on our way in a reason amount of time so we had to leav 10 minut later sinc noth had happen other friend rave about this locat so it was a disappoint experimamma mia has been around for a good while  and with four star over 157 review  that a pretti solid number  henc my degre of dissatisfact is more a reflect of my disappoint that my experi should have been better than it was

they have an extens menu with lot of option  all i realli want was the standard pizza and wing deliv  there are so mani option for this in my neighborhood that you would think competit would be fierc  well mayb not so  anyway i opt for the standard in my hous a small pizza with a dozen wing  i ad a coupl of item like pepperoni black oliv and extra chees  i order the wing hot  it took a while for deliveri but it final got here  it was halloween night so that understandable

what not understand is the burnt pizza that was deliv  oh the top were fine in fact quit tasti but offset by the charcoalburnt tast of the blacken bottom of the crust it kinda overpow the entir flavor of the pizza  the wing were quit hot and tasti and i would order them again  probabl the onli place in my neighborhood that understand what hot mean  ala again the burnt pizza  here is my problem with that  you know this pizza is go out for deliveri  you know it is burnt  if you dont then you should fire the cook  you assum that onc the pizza is deliv an hour after order the custom is prolli not go to complain and insist you cook and deliv anoth  you are right about that  830 at night im starv and no im not gonna wait anoth hour for you to fix this  you should have known the pizza was bad go out the door and you should not have let that happen

that was the good part of this experi  now for the bad  when i place my order and i look at my receipt i found these addit charg  300 deliveri charg  150 transact fee  35 merchant process fee  and then of cours your driver is expect me to tip him  so around ten dollar just for the luxuri of order a burnt pizza

1 star for deliveri charge
1 star for transact fee
1 star for merchant process fee

5 star for either not know your send out a burnt pizza or for know it and send it anyway

sorri mamma mia mayb a bad night for you but it cost me 28start with a rude hostess who refus to seat my wife and i at a table
a it was a 4 top and not more than a minut later the other hostess seat two peopl there  no bread servic though everi other tabl  had bread  entre were serv while i was clear not half way through my salad  both  pasta entre were less than oliv garden quality
draft beer not avail frozen line beer i order not available
i have never been to a restaur that add a automat gratuiti to the bill for a parti of two but they did here  i guess with the problem they have with food and  servic they feel no one would leav a descent tip
lot of other italian restaur in scottsdal  all are better than bobbii want to enjoy this place but i could not 
the manag is veri rude she would not tri to accommod a larg parti that want to come in and spend money and enjoy jazz 
the music wasnt that special but it was good and easi to listen too 
the bar servic is expens and they dont even have good select or choicgossip update

i havent been back sinc my last bad experi but i did get some gossip from a reliabl sourc  appar a littl while back  right around the time i notic a signific declin in the qualiti  they lost their head chef  word is he went over to the other sushi mon in henderson

and i also found out that it not entir correct that the two sushi mon are not relat  appar the old manag of this sushi mon on sahara start up the sushi mon in henderson  there may have been like some sort of payment or franchis type agreement  

current the two are separ own and run but there is a littl bit of a relationship there as you can see  howev if you ask them they will say they are not related

anyway if the head chef gone over to henderson then i guess ill have to check that place out againive read the review for this place with great interest and after much care consider gave ole tex a tri tonight

wo unimpress  and this come from a guy whos a fan of dive mexican restaur  if i could sum up the entir experi in a word it would be dull

w walk into the place which was larg empti  there were two other tabl each with 2 peopl  we were immedi seat and that about the end of the good news

serv didnt understand our request for a patron margarita on the rock with salt  it took us 56 explan befor she got it down  she came back 15 minut later with the margarita  it was close but didnt have ani salt oh well

w then ask if we could get some chip yes i know theyr 1 and that total cool  i can handl pay 1 for some chip not sure whi so mani yelper have a cow over this and again she return about 1015 minut later with our chip turn and walk away

w stop her and said that wed like to order some food  her respons was oh i thought you guy want to keep talk so i was go to check back in a bit  um ok i guess

w order 4 taco  the philli cheesesteak taco the buffalo chicken taco a classic taqueria with chicken and one of the delux taco with carn asada  off she went our order in hand

w munch on the chip and the salsa we tri all four 4 salsa varieti  each tast near ident to the other  even the hot salsa didnt tast ani differ than the medium or mild did  sure they were differ color but that was about it   argh

20 minut pass and our taco arrived

tini  absolut miniscul in size spars top  the cheesesteak taco wasnt anyth like i pictur it had a singl chunk of beef tast more like a steakum with 1 onion slice 34 small cube of red pepper and a dribbl of chees sauc  tast  none  complet lacking

th buffalo chicken taco was even wors  pictur a singl chicken mcnugget dunk in a bad buffalo wing sauc and place on a tini corn tortilla and then top with 34 small chunk of tomato and onion  tast  none  like eat cardboard

th chicken taco wasnt ani better  a sliver of grill chicken a few small chip of pico flavorless and a few shred of chees  tast  none  ive had better pico from aldi groceri store

and final the delux taco take the steakum from the philli taco and throw on a bunch of flavorless top  yuck

al in all  a horribl forgett experi  im not exagger when i say that taco bell has better taco than this place doe  serious  and our meal cost just over 30  yike  4 taco 1 margarita chip and a soda  wow

tex tubb  fail in a big way

servic  1 star nonexistent
food  0 star no flavor small taco just awful
valu  0 stars
misc  1 star interior is sort of neat

skip this place and go to a real taqueria taco bell or taco john  id recommend that ole tex take a weekend and visit some of the taqueria in austin for a refresh coursveri mod look place  but i found the food to be pretti bland and my carmel latt just okay  dog friend patio a major plus for me and my dog

wel  there you go  build a communiti one person at a time  i say the lux communiti is just fine  and the coffe  servic much better  i was origin be kind  honest this is the most pretenti place ive ever walk into  and there is noth cool about it  zero substanc  onli pretens  fashion and style  but so sorri you cant buy cool  and this place prove it on a daili basieven though im give fix a one star rate the food was rather good to be fair ill give a full review and then switch gear at the end

i was in las vega last month with my compani for magic the huge fashion convent and on our first night in town we decid to go out and have a fanci compani dinner after sever call to multipl restaur we final decid on fix in the bellagio

w show up sunday even around 9pm and the place was complet pack luckili we thought ahead and made a reserv in just a few minut our tabl for six was ready

to get the night go we order a coupl bottl of wine we took our time look over the menu and even longer make our final decis everyth on the menu seem delici i land on the lobster taco with grill mango and cilantro to start the four small taco came on a serv plate that perfect fit each taco the shell were crispi and the lobster was fresh and juici the small cilantro leav were a great way to make the lobster flavor pop even more

for my entre i got the seabass with risotto babi shrimp and lobster broth the cut of fish was cook perfect and when i cut into it the lobster broth soak in and made the bass even more delici the babi shrimp were nice addit as well and were cook just right

th night was go great up to this point the food was delici and the servic was top notch it was a great night to celebr our first night in sin citi that is until my boss found a safeti pin in her risotto see photo i includ yes a safeti pin you know those incred sharp object that can stick in your throat if ingest yep those thing thank she saw it befor she unknow ate it of cours we immedi call for the manag as our server took the dish away

th manag told us that this doesnt happen that often hmm so it has happen befor how could a safeti pin even land in someon food if i find a hair in my meal the review instant drop down to 35 star and i expect the meal to be free but a safeti pin is complet inexcus the real kicker was that my boss didnt receiv a new entre and when we got the bill her dish wasnt even comp instant we call for the manag again and made sure her meal was free honest we were complet shock that the entir meal wasnt comp when a mistak that danger has happened

when dine out at highend restaur it expect that your experi will be flawless especi when your pay these extrem price when someth as outrag as a safeti pin find it way in a custom dinner i as well as the rest of my cowork would expect the restaur to do anyth and everyth it can to remedi the mistak unfortun the restaur fail on everi level and fulli deserv such a low rate so pleas be sure to inspect everi bite while dine herei arrang to have my compani holiday dinner at fix  what a big mistak it was  we had a big group of over 30 peopl they arrang to have us sit in round tabl join togeth some had 4 peopl other had 5 or 6 peopl  while the food was subpar at best the servic was the worst i have ever experienc   it start dure appet when each plate had 4 piec of flat bread  the server didnt bother to make sure that tabl with 5 or 6 peopl had enough for everyon so i had to flag them down to ask  when the main cours was serv the steak came befor the steak sauc and some tabl were miss steak sauc  as the host i was expect the waiter and waitress to take care of make sure my guest were well taken care of  instead i had to run from tabl to tabl to make sure everyon had enough sauc needless to say this wasnt the onli problem  the side dish mash potato and cream spinach were so small i manag to get 1 teaspoon of it and there was hard enough for my tabl of 4  i had to complain and the waitress brought out 1 extra side for my entir parti  the same thing happen at dessert  some tabl got their doughnut dessert other did not  i had to run around again bring extra dessert from one tabl to anoth   after complain to the waitress that i want to speak to the manag it took an employe of mine to final get the assist general manag to come over to talk to me  

in ani decent restaur my experi would have result in a discount a reduct in servic fee or at least some sort of compens to make up for the bad servic but all i heard from him was he was sorri  

i will never host anoth group event at ani of the mgm properti or restaur again becaus of this bad experi  fix need some serious fix  the manag should be fire for the inabl to supervis and the server need much more train the food is over price and for the 600 in gratuiti they charg me compulsori for larg group i was expect far better servic than this

th atmospher was horribl  you can smell cigarett smoke come in from the casino and the sound was so loud i couldnt hear anyth the person sit across from me was say without them have to shout

avoid this restaur for larg groupi understand that escap is in this new locat but base on my experi today although i have been a coupl of time  im not sure that ill go back 

beyond the odd layout of the place and the slight overpr fare one of the worker today was extrem rude a woman came to drop off the onion as in she was a deliveri person and left with a few extra copi of the isthmus a free newspap an employe stomp out of the main shop yell at them for steal and snatch the newspap out of her hand this was disrespect rude and in my opinion extrem sexist he was complet out of line even if he didnt want them to take copi of a free newspap then it was inappropri to snatch them out of her hand and then shove one copi at her 

i was will to give escap the benefit of the doubt some time to improv itself after it unwant move but this just went over the line im sorri escap but i wont be come back patio or no patiohere is a letter i sent to the restaur after my dine experi that summar how it went

dear general manager

i am write to express my deep dissatisfact with my recent experi at db brasseri at the wynn las vega hotel  this was the most insult horrend meal in recent memori regrett for a restaur with such high distinct and reputation

i am a vegetarian due to allergi against most meat and seafood but becaus i can still consum dairi and egg product i have felt veri littl limit in continu to enjoy epicurean delight  i know that with some thought and care vegetarian menus can be more entic and delici than the convent menus from my experi dine here in san francisco with chef ron siegel thoma keller and other renown chef with the same high regard as chef boulud  this is whi we trust your restaur personnel when they told us when we reserv seat at your restaur that you would be abl to accommod vegetarian on nye

w had a 9 pm seat for the nye celebr and know veri well that nye is one of the busiest night at a restaur we call week in advanc to confirm that a vegetarian menu would be avail for our tabl  we even call a few day prior to the event to reconfirm that our reserv was list with a special request for a vegetarian menu

when we arriv and were seat our server had no idea that there was suppos to be a vegetarian menu  surpris she disappear for a while emerg with a laughabl plate of vegetarian amus she seem so proud to serv  it consist of the regular amus without the oyster and the cream insid the cream puff  this concept of subtract from the regular menu indic that the kitchen had no intent of serv a vegetarian diner the remaind of the even was similar  a salad in which the lobster was simpli remov a plate of daikon from the first cours instead of the two filet for the main dish  the level of ingredi was drop to a point it was unclear whi we were be charg the same cost for the tradit and the vegetarian menu  

at this point what the kitchen should have done is compliment a bottl of our wine after it was total and absolut clear that there was no prepar that was made to accommod us as we had been promis  at least an appear from the chef to apolog would have left us feel a littl bit better  instead there was noth but a full price meal for all of us  disgrac  that is the onli word that come to mind as i recal the evening

needless to say i feel no need to visit ani of the other daniel boulud restaur and will be share my stori with my epicurean friend on both coast  i hope that next time your restaur will have the honesti and integr to refus a vegetarian custom at the reserv stage instead of simpli have us seat for one more diner fee  there are mani other restaur where vegetarian are treat with more respect for a truli enjoy dine experi  by accept the reserv for a vegetarian and serv scrap of food after take the meat portion away and charg full price for it is disgrac and insult especi for a restaur of your caliber


update

th gm call me and apolog for the experi  he is go to refund me for the vegetarian meal  im glad they actual took the time to respond and follow up

update2

i got my credit card refund for the vegetarian mealoh good where do i even start  ok so i was in a group with 6 peopl and 2 peopl order the 2000 all you can eat sushi and the rest order from the regular menu here is a breakdown of our experi 

1 horribl servic our waiteress was veri mean slow neglig and veri ef rude  

2 the allyoucaneat sushi tast like old costco sushi  nasti  the rice tast old and realli dri  the seafood was veri scarc and you can onli order 3 roll at a time  and it took forev for our waitress to come back each time so we can order more sushi

3 i order the tom kha soup and it tast noth like how it should be  it was water down oili and it wasnt even spicey 

4 my friend order the combin fri rice and it was veri dri and bland  even the meat tast like rubber

5 it took forev for our waitress to bring our check to us  she knew we were done eat a long time ago and she still ignor us

6 the restaur manag was an ahol  after our horribl horribl experi we complain to the manag and he was be such an asshol  he was tell us that we should have brought it up to his attent in the begin of the dinner the reason whi we wait was becaus we gave it a benefit of the doubt  we were tri realli hard to be understand and was hope our servic would improv but it didnt  who is he to tell us how and when to complain  he just made his restaur look even more stupid  and becaus we wait too long to complain he onli comp us for the 2 all you can eat sushi even though a major of what we order was nasti as hell  we still complain and he end up take off the fri rice  big freak whoop  

i serious hope this restaur close down or at least get new manag  they seem pretti unorgan here and by judg the other review on here im not the onli one that think this restaur is down the drain  avoid this restaur by all mean dont let the all you can eat banner outsid fool you  save your money and run run far far away from this placeboooooooooooooooooo

worst place ive ever been to in vega right when we walk in we were veri rude greet ladi right away told me that becaus our group was larg if we dont split up wed be charg a 18 tip which i appreci her tell me but i was caught off guard and i said excus me could you repeat that she roll her eye at me and repeat herself okay whatev hoe i let it go

w were sat fair quick my group was a tabl of 4 at a booth i was on the outer side im a decent tall guy about 6 feet so when you sit me in a booth the size meant for midget my leg will stick out a bit on the edg the server came by and kick my foot hey move your foot insid i obey her order a bit shock but whatev yolo ho so i did after she walk away i discuss it with my friend we agre that mayb english wasnt her first languag so just to let it go

1 space first of all this place is realli realli realli tini so sit situat are way too close for comfort  i recommend small parti with 4 peopl max

2 menu just becaus it list doe not mean it available

3 qualiti not so great my hash brown were burnt more like hash black and the rest of the food too greasi i myself is not a big fan of fat

4 beverag uh i rather go to circl k and get a cup

5 servic ok but for such a limit custom how can servic go wrong



al in all i was not impress with this place  i even went back for lunch think mayb it was onli dure breakfast that this place lack the hype that everybodi was talk about but onc again i veri disappoint  

btw i like my burger with butter and not butter with burgerwait your shit me right  35min wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and egg  no wayi feel like a douch bag for give matt onli 1 star when everyon els rave about this place and the owner truli is such a delight so in my defens let me explain
thi place is a hot spot everi time ive tri to go there it pack  each time ive never want to wait so i went on my way
on sunday i was just down the street from them at valley youth theatr watch winni the pooh with my son and i thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward  when we got out of the theatr it was pour rain in giant bucket one of those rariti in phoenix where you cant see what in front of you caus it rain so hard  well we brave the rain and drove to matt 5 min after their post close time and yup you guess it despit me and my 3 12 year old son drench wet and  look plead at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhil to get out of the rain they told us they were close and sent us on our way  talk about tough standard i guess when you are as popular as matt you get to make and stick by the rule you make
despit that experi i still want to tri matt becaus of all the applaud ive heard about the place final i made it there on one of those day when i had the time for the long wait and sad for me i was sore disappoint by the breakfast serv to me
i had rememb read some articl about the big breakfast serv at matt and that what i was expect  i order the waffl with bacon for 9 expect a denni portion of food but with flavor and excel  the place was pack so i had to wait 30min for my waffl to materi in front of me  when i got the one piec of waffl and one piec of bacon serv to me i thought perhap while wait i had accident swallow alic in wonderland tonic and was now a giant look at my rather small serv of food on my plate  serious i almost felt tear come into my eye i was so disappoint  needless to say after tri so mani time to go to matt and final get there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kid me  where the rest of my food experi i will not go back there  it a good thing too caus it far from my hous and i hate waitwait 30 min to find out the girl was skip me on the wait list she said she wasnt skip me that there were place for two peopl to sit but not one the last time i check one person is abl to sit where two peopl can sit i dont give a pretti fuck that you are tri to turn more tabl if i am wait 30 min when it my turn it my turn if someon that came after me sit befor i do you are skip me there is no argu with me about it wont be backupon have the worst lunch ever at car yesterday i was immedi compel to write a scath review  howev i thought id marin on it for a day  well the queasi has not subsid and here i am a day later to tell anyon who will listen that this place is terrible

id look at their menu onlin befor leav and notic that they had a tuna salad wrap on the menu  when i got there the tuna salad was onli avail on a salad  i ask the waitress if i could get it on bread instead and she stare blank at me befor repli well we have a tuna melt  i ask her if the tuna on the tuna melt was inde the tuna salad and she said no  appar the tuna salad is not avail ani other way but on lettuc  so i order the tuna melt cold  

when it came it was disgust  it was liter tuna straight out of a can no mayonnais with a coupl caper sprinkl on top  there was way too much bread which was dri and gross  i ask the waitress for some mayonnais which it took her over five minut to get meanwhil she clear dish and complet other task  i did eventu get a blob of mayonnais in a dixi cup but when i tri to mix it in with the tuna the whole sandwich fell apart  i end up tri to eat some of it with my fork and forego the bread altogeth but at this point i was so gross out i and irrit with car that i didnt eat much

also my friend order a hot sandwich that was suppos to come with pepper but did not  he point this out to the waitress and she return sever minut later with a few refriger pepper on a plate  he ask anoth waitress if she could bring him some warm pepper to go with his warm sandwich which she did after sever minut  coincident he start feel sick short after and had to miss work today

when the bill came the ohsohelp waitress had charg me extra for the mayonnais  needless to say i wont be go back there  if you are in the mood for a sandwich downtown there are a million better place where the server are actual decent  some suggest cibo the main ingredi alehous and old station  even subway has amaz servic and gourmet food compar to cardang  i wish i had seen the review prior to visit this restaur butit was not my choic actually

what complet freak me out was that the bill was 8500  8500 for a meal for two  for mexican food  excus me

th atmospher was nice the waitstaff was averag and the food was subpar  actual the fish taco were the worst i have tast but my date love the carnita  the pitcher of margarita are larg fill with ice  and everyth is waaay overpr for the flavor and qualiti of the food

i wont return4 star realli  i thought this place was horrible

w end up eat at pizzaria francesco becaus we had to meet up with some peopl at treasur island  francesco was the first restaur we saw when we walk into the hotel and it look like a nice restaur so we decid to tri it out

w order 2 pizza between 4 peopl becaus we didnt want to over eat befor we start drink  we order a peperoni and sausag pizza httpstaticpxyelpcombphotomn2pmfm8fqutgacibeizgl and gawd i dont even rememb what the other pizza was becaus i didnt even bother to take a picture

sup greasi and too strong on the tomato flavor after eat one piec eat anoth one was work we didnt even finish the pizza i also got the hous red wine and wow it tast like the wine was sit there open for a while 

the ambianc was pretti nice the servic was ok but the food was terribl and it was definit overpr  i rather eat a pizza hut pizza

non of us like the pizza here  this was a total dinner failif i could put zero star i would  food is nice and all but servic is most import  i believ lisa g herself is the woman who ask me and my boss and my bosss boss to leav our tabl and meet elsewher so she could seat more peopl in the restaur  that nice thank for noth  anyhow the bowl of ball were noth to yelp about and i was quit disappoint that they carri the oddest soda flavor  dont ask what it is your server think you are a whack job for not know know what the beverag select is

im a bit bitter mayb bc i suggest the restaur to my boss and then got treat like dirt  it look so cute from the outsid and realli is in the insid and sinc i live in the neighborhood i like to tri out the new restaur and bar  anyhow lisa g and her staff can take the ball and shove itclumsi space delight food horribl lame servic hostess wasnt veri nice and the waiter was forget and spacey though he was veri cute what happen when cute run out

i actual wrote lisa g an email describ the bad spacey servic and told her the name of the server she then inform me that was one of her best server and i had to be mistaken the onli mistak here would be ever go back she show me huh

singl star for food onliive offici sworn off buffet i was lean in that direct to begin with but our experi at le villag buffet seal the deal

th buffet in vega have been head in the same direct over the past five year  more expens while less qualiti ive seen this happen at rio wynn and now pari i live in vega for three year and work as a supervisor in one of the largest casino there as a frequent visitor to buffet i can say this isnt simpli specul it what gone down

l buffet when it open was one of the finest in vega a fantast assort of food station incred servic and dessert to die for when we return to this buffet in januari i was so disappoint i felt sick all night that wed pay about 70 for two of us to eat here

th buffet cater primarili toward seafood now which is great if your a seafood lover i am not there were veri few option that were appeal for nonseafood fan there is a generous mountain of shrimp to mine from and there are crab leg i do like shellfish howev whenev the crab leg are put out unless your camp there your go to get complet rape by the pushi folk that get there befor you and blast through the pile dilig pick it clean of the good leg leav the spoil to everyon els it was frustrat and annoy as hell

th food select i did have were okay  but definit not worth 30 or so per person the dessert station was a disast name of dessert did not match what was out obvious the staff here doesnt care it was a tri your luck situat and patron were left to guess what treat they were actual getting

at one station i couldnt separ two bowl and i pass them toward a staff member on the other side of the counter tell her they were stuck she look at me like i was an idiot and slam the bowl on the granit counter which made them separ she gave me one and start put the other back into the clean bowl pile after id explain to her that i gave them to her becaus my hand were all over them a woman stand next to me spoke right up and ask the staffer what she was think that id just told her i was touch the bowl the staff member frown at the other custom and remov the bowl from the stack total disgust make you wonder what els end up in the clean plate stack there

t clear was slow and find someon to refil our soda was a joke total contrast to when this buffet was new and it seem that there were sever busser for each tabl that were on you like vultur the minut you clean your plate or put an empti glass on the tabl not the case anymor sad and that ad to my frustration

stand in line for anoth station the final straw broke this camel back  a woman stood in front of me eat food off of her plate and suck her finger then you guess it she went right on use that hand to use tong and spoon get more food from the buffet

and realli that the core problem with ani buffet peopl are disgust they are piggish and pushi and dirti you can somewhat control the level of a dine experi but you can never complet control the other custom case in point the wick spoon at cosmopolitan  consid to be the best buffet in vega now by mani we ate there and the experi was okay  except for the two tabl close to us with loud drunk douchebag guest be so loud that it disrupt everyon experience

so the next time you consid shell out the better part of 100 on a vega buffet rememb what your pay for  crowd of stranger paw at the same spoon and tong breath and cough over the same food station and a wait staff that is there make just over minimum wage that honest wont give a rat ass if you ever return or not it vega and the peopl will come pretti much no matter what

for the forese futur i am done with buffeti think it sad that im write a one star review about a restaur on the strip i dont write these often but this just goe to show the level of frustar i had dure our visit here i honest had high hope just becaus of the layout and facad of the restaur and i person love cafe that are outdoor

food food was mediocr as far the varieti on the menu there wasnt much we were there clear for breakfast but by the time our waitress elvia came to our tabl we ask if we could also see a lunch menu there were five of us in our parti so some of us order and share our meal i had the corn beef hash which wasnt bad but i felt like the food was on the colder side our other companion also mention their fri were cold my other friend who order the foie gras burger said he wasnt too happi with his burger patti and his fri were also cold 

environmentambi the cafe realli ad to the pari theme of the hotel there was a lot of seat indoor and even in the outdoor aspect part of the cafe we request there to be seat outdoor becaus the restaur is part of the casino floor it tend to be on the louder side what made it even louder was that they were play the world cup on various televis around the casino includ the restaur 

servic for a restaur on the strip i expect better when we were seat we wait a long time for someon to even offer us drink we notic that although our tabl of five was in the middl of the outdoor seat area no one could figur out who was wait our tabl we saw numer time when the server hostess and what look like the manag kept talk about our tabl we watch as other smaller tabl were seat and attend to quick i was particular hungri this day and i was not in the mood to be ignor especi when there were so mani peopl around us enjoy their dine experi it almost came to the point where we were look for a manag to complain to to our dismay most of the worker around us were stare at the televis to watch the game i was particular annoy at the fact that we still had not been even ask about our drink one of the hostess came out and apolog and said our server was come out shortlywhich was complet incorrect by the time our server arriv she seem way too distract to even welcom us to the restaur i was appal when she came to the tabl and said hello ill be your server today and then immedi walk away from the tabl to start collect check thing like this happen with this particular server a few time by the time our food was eventu serv anoth waitress took over our tabl we had no idea that they switch server on us im not sure when this took place but it may have had someth to do with our food be pretti cold i dont know if someon forgot to run our food but at this point i was alreadi veri unhappi with our overal experience

tip i honest have noth good to say about this dine experi sure this was a restaur on the strip and it look like a good place to dine but the servic aspect realli kill it im pretti sure i wont be dine here ever againour first night in las vega for my girlfriend birthday trip her cousin suggest this place cousin and cousin husband had arriv the night befor us walk past kahunavill heard the general parti atmospher commot come from within and determin this might be a good spot to spend some time and money boy were they wrong

i dont know what was happen the night befor but when we came it was dead grant it was earli onli about 800 or so but it was a friday night and we want to have fun the atmospher is cheesi remind me of a rainforest café but more sleazi at first i thought it was a rainforest café ha ha ha 

we sat down at the bar and the bartend outnumb us sever of them seem busi serv the few custom other than us around the bar then our bartend came over who didnt appear to have ani custom as yet so you would think hed be happi for the busi but instead gave us an attitud like we were disrupt his relax time my girlfriend ask what he would recommend from the drink menu which is her mo as she general doesnt bother with make decis in unfamiliar territori and reli on what the employe like instead of name off a few drink or his favorit or heck the most expens thing on the menu becaus if hed had the brain to say it she probabl would have just bought it he made some snarki comment about read the menu okay dude you are on the clock right like this is your job right so she order a shooter and a margarita which was overpr and she said it wasnt that great her cousin order a flamboy purpl drink that came in a big fishbowl souvenir cup and was smoke with dri ice it look realli cool and was a big hit but of cours was overpr dont know what the husband order for my part i order a monster in the can which cost 700 outrag 

on top of that he mock my gfs cousin when he ask how wed like the bill she clear state and gestur that she and her husband would be togeth im hear impair and i could hear her say it two peopl down the bar he copi her gestur and said i dont know what this mean all snippi all four of us look at each other like what this guy problem did we mistaken end up at dick  we are liter his onli custom i guess he was either have a bad night or just doesnt like make money he didnt get ani of ours

it was so awkward after that we left i guess the angri bartend had the night off the previous night becaus he was clear not bring the parti on friday so we went somewher els none of us will be backmonsieur rochuchon chef of the century

i thought you should know that your lateli in vega is quick becom a 0star restaur here some complimentari advic for you freeofcharge

1 use open tabl  
we were come in town for the jabbawockeez and had book a tabl at lateli befor the show we were distraught to find upon arriv that your staff had made a mistak and book us for the next day all your hostess and manag manag to tell us was were fulli commit over and over when ask about an empti tabl in the front we were told by the manag that there were mani big parti that even and the tabl was reserv for a parti of six that wouldnt otherwis fit at the bar to add insult to injuri three ladi walk up 45 minut into our wait talk to someon they knew who work at the restaur and the 6person tabl was prompt reset for the three of them and they were seat  anoth five minut pass and we were final seat in the back by the entranc to the kitchen if we didnt have a show to go to at the mgm and a time constraint we would not have wait heck we werent even offer to wait in the comfort of the loung if you were to take reserv through open tabl there would be no question when a reserv is schedul all the unpleasantri could have been avoided

2 hire more season matur manag staff  
the manag walk pass us mani time after we were seat she avoid eye contact everi time and not onc did she come by to apolog for the mixup or attempt to explain whi the 6person tabl that was not avail for us but was appar avail for the three ladi who came after us 

3 hire more experienc wait staff 
     would you believ it  i was half way through my chill foie gras cours befor a wait staff brought the toast and said more toast i never got toast in the first place  i wouldnt be surpris at this type of servic at restaur belong to a chef who is a newbi in the culinari world but not you monsieur joel robuchon
     the wait staff was told about our time constraint of a 930 pm show despit that the servic did not speed up to accommod our timefram after wait 50 minut to get seat we wait anoth 20 minut befor we got bread our last dish were serv within minut befor 930 pm our friend onli got to take a coupl bite of her last dish horribl time manag by contrast mario batali bb ristorant at the venetian did a wonder job manag the pace of our dinner so we were abl to leav in time for our departur flight

w were disgust to have spent almost 400 between the four of us to be treat like second class citizen the food didnt make up for it either we realli look forward to dine at your lateli but were thorough disappointwe had dinner at lateli last night and it was a complet disappoint if you are look to spend upward of 1k on dinner i suggest that you go to anoth restaur instead 

i made our dinner reserv three week in advanc and ask for counter seat i was told it would be no problem i also call the day befor our dinner to confirm our reserv and onc again were told it would counter seat when we arriv at the restaur 15 min prior to our reserv we were told that we cant sit at the counter and they can onli give us a tabl i explain to the hostess that i had just confirm our seat the day prior she was veri rude and just threw up her hand and told us there was noth she can do the restaur was complet empti at the time i ask to speak to a manag a guy with a red tie came out and stood right in front of me check the comput screen after ignor us for a good 2 minut he told us seat are never guarante he also proceed to lectur both my husband and i that if we sit at the counter anoth parti wouldnt be abl to eat at the restaur tonight at all his tone was incred obnoxi we never rais our voic to either the whole time if i this restaur werent so high rate we would walk away for sure he final did give us counter seat but by that time  he had manag to ruin a good part of our dinner experi alreadi i kept worri about if anoth group were not go to be abl to dine there becaus like he lectur but the restaur was never full the entir time we were there 6pm9pm there were alway tabl and counter avail the counter seat we did get were right by the entranc so it was rather loud and my entir view of the kitcken were block by the corner decor in the kitchen 

i would not have given the restaur a one star rate if the dish were outstand we had the discoveri menu and menu b we got to tri quit a few dish that night they were so underwhelm i dont understand the 5 star rate on yelp i was particular disappoint at their signatur dish la caill quail with foie gras serv with mash potato it wasnt even good bare warm to the touch and pretti bland they also manag to over cook a fish dish i had i cant pick out a singl dish that stood out to me on the entir discoveri menu 

our server was pleasant and the present were nice but given the bad servic we encount at the door and the mediocr food  this is no way of deserv a michelin star the few other michelin star place we have been to in la sf and japan are far superior in both servic and food  i cant believ i pick this place to wast that much moneyavoid this place i came here with a friend late night and sat down look at the ayc all you can eat menu and it was like 3499 or was it 3599 per person so we left befor order as we did we got bad mouth from one of the korean ladi in korean so i cant say for the qualiti of the food 

this place was a complet ghost town and we were the onli custom in here by the way that alon tell me the place isnt all that great

i move to vega not too long ago from los angel and this is a complet rip off a good la korean bbq ayc charg 1499  1999 for premium meat i understand that this place is open 247 and is locat right on the strip right past the wynn on las vega blvd 

the price they charg scream to me tourist trap
i would never come here or take my friend here there are so mani better one that are fair price in spring mountain china town areaso i walk in to padr look around and decid to take a seat at the bar i ask the bartend for a menu and he told me that he couldnt serv me have never been to padr befor i inquir as to what on earth he was talk about appar the rentasecur gave some sort of secret servic hand signal not to serv me but why

then the gorilla at the door decid to pay me a person visit came over and ask me to leav himself i mean i was dress in an expens jacket slack a nice collar shirt and im a cleancut late 30someth guy so it wasnt as if i had stumbl in wear a sequinstud thong and nippl tassel with my junk hang out i ask to speak to the manag the door guy left and return a few second later he simpli said someth to the bartend then there was my menu appar somebodi earlier wear the same color jacket was kick out for some reason

no apolog noth i order a beer and left with a simpl apolog from someon anyon i would have stay for dinner

mi advic if you go do not wear a burgundi jacketi want to rip the yelp sticker right off their front window

to start the owner seat us we didnt know he was the owner he just seat us and then went back to his beer he offer us a margarita i said sure and he gestur vagu that i was to get up from my tabl and go to the bar go to the bar when im pay that much for an entre hell no

th margarita
delici and they onli serv about a shot worth not a shot of tequila but a shot of margarita it was gone in two sips

th lazi enchilada appar the owner favorite
first it enchilada singular if you ask me what it was fill with i couldnt tell you there wasnt enough substanc to figur out if it was chees or chicken or just a tortilla i was warn that the spici sauc was realli spici and urg to tri the mild sauc as well the spici sauc was noth more than chile past the same shit i get from the groceri store the mild sauc was okay but mild sauc  meatless tortilla  crap

th fajita
again singular just one tortilla the meat was overcook and all the spice were overshadow by all the salt

th rice and beans
th rice was crunchi undercook burnt the bean werent squishi which is good but they also had no flavor and who serv food with bay leav swim in it

and there were at least two hair in our food we gave up count at the same time we gave up eating

nev ever againbroken glass everywhere

no this is not a line from grandmast flash but liter there were shard of glass underneath my table

i was eat with my friend this morn when i felt someth wet on my foot  when i look down i was shock to see my foot cover in blood  i becam nauseat and want to faint  i call the server to ask for a band aid and told him that i had cut myself on a piec of glass  as i examin the floor i found more broken piec   when the server disappear for more than ten minut i then ask for the manag who took anoth five minut to attend to me  whi were they take so long

when the manag came that is when i realiz mandalay bay will hire just anyon who will work the graveyard shift  the manag attitud about the entir situat was disappoint and disrespect  there i was bleed profus cut was pretti deep and she didnt rush over to me becaus she said she was wait for secur becaus that is their polici  i understand busi has polici but i what i dont is whi she couldnt come over immedi to assess the situat  the cafe was empti it was 6am and i was flag down everi server to get the manag  the demeanor and tone she use made me feel like she realli didnt give a crap about her custom  

all she had to say was im sorri this happen i will get secur to help you with first aid but when i told her that she said with attitud i cannot apolog becaus then im claim liabil  also our busi polici state that you cannot be barefoot which got me more upset becaus i came in wear heel  i took them off while eat   ive seen kid crawl on the floor at these restaur what if a piec of glass had cut one of them  what if someon fell and slice their wrist on the glass  

mandalay bay use to be a highclass resort with excel custom care but they have definit lost their valu  mayb that is whi their room rate were signific lower than the other on the strip no one is stay there anymor  they have nice room but i dont think i will be come back here anymore

i hope someon at mandalay bay can address this rude manag at raffl cafe and get her fire   shes a black girl in her earli thirti with glass i didnt get her name right when i start file a complaint she disappear  she should not be allow to work in ani custom servic posit  

what a bad way to end my weekend in vegasuck burnt nacho horribl service

i cant even rememb if our waitress greet us she had on such a sour face the entir time she was serv her tabl she quick led us to our tabl hand us menus didnt say a word and left when she came back to put in our drink order 5 min later we tri to order our food at the same time but she just ran away again the busboy came with our drink so we had to wait anoth 5 min to catch her final she come back and we place our order angus burger and super nachos

angus burger super greasi so we had to ask the waitress for napkin to dab all the oil out she drop them off and walk away realli quick the burger could have use some more flavor but at least they got the medium rare part right and the fri amaz i think the fri are the onli thing keep this place aliv honestly

sup nacho fals advertis when i saw this on the menu i thought super nacho that must includ everyth no that was not the case there was no meat in it whatsoev there were howev a lot of top sour cream guacamol pico de gallo and chees chees chees but none of it matter when all the chees is burnt into the tortilla chip we struggl get one chip at a time at this point i use the fork and start play with the nacho onli to discov the insid be cold and soggy

and now we wait to tri to flag down our love waitress again 10 min pass by and this is what i notice

at a tabl across the room a man is tri to use the rest of his food credit and tell our waitress his intent of do so his meal cost more than his credit they go back and forth so she basic yell at him that he cannot appli his credit to cover his meal when he explain that he will pay the differ calm she near rip the receipt out of his hand and walk to the regist person i would have snap at a b if this were done to me but i digress

th tabl that just arriv next to us get their food almost immedi and what do they order super nacho but their nacho not onli look hot and fresh they were nice and crisp not burnt



fin she get back to our tabl and we inform her that our food is burnt she doe not apolog out of courtesi for the restaur sake she onli ask do you still want them of cours i dont want them wtf so goe on to ask if we want dessert sinc we werent full we decid hey whi not bad choic the browni cake was sticki a diabet attack wait to happen and the ice cream on top frozen rock solid i guess they got the ice part right

and when we got the bill of cours she charg us for the dessert ugh never again

avoid this place if you are look for a late night eat and avoid the asian waitress at all costi have avoid this place up until now becaus everyon i knew who had been said it was terribl i was somewhat amus by the name of the place but im a believ in word of mouth  and the wom of this place was dismal

tonight my dine companion and i were head to sauc and decid to tri pink taco on a whim the place wasnt veri pack  there were plenti of tabl avail at 7pm on a friday so we were seat right away 

the way the place is set up we were seat right near the bar and our tabl was bar height this meant that we had to endur asshol squeez past to go to the shitter and peopl leav their drink on our tabl or lean on it it was pretti aw i understand they have a popular bar but this is a restaur too it would be a realli easi fix to solv this problem

on to the food it was shit the dish are somewhat inspir by mexican cuisin but they are rather bland and kinda gross the burrito i had was horribl  dog food it smell rank and i couldnt finish it the salad wasnt bad but it was bore my girl got shrimp taco and end up feel ill later in the night she wasnt at all impressed

drink  i had a hous margarita on rock with salt it was pretti tasti but lack a fair amount of alcohol plus it has given me a headach  im blame cheap tequilla my girl had a signatur margarita  i tast it and it was decent but a littl too sweet they had a wine tast of their own label wine as well they had a chardonnay and a pinot noirchardonnay mix we had a tast of the latter and it liter tast like a mimosa made with rancid orang juic that was sop up with a dirti dishrag and squeez into the glass

everyon in the joint was either an old ugli dude or a highschool girl wear big sister cloth or gay coupl this place is a joke i wouldnt come for the food nor the atmospher nor the drink im never go back

on the upsid dinner was under 100 buck and the hostess was cute apart from that this place need to be stay away fromdont believ the hype

sinc i was with my former exboyfriend i was nervous and happi and giddi so it didnt matter what the fuck i order as long as i took a coupl bite to keep him happi but it also didnt matter that i couldnt read the fuck menu becaus i was too drunk

i was a littl loud and by littl i mean i proclaim to the entir restaur that my ex boyfriend had a red mark on his nose from some fuck accid boohoo asshol and i put makeup on to cover it up

we sat down and order our water and tea my dine partner want to see a wine list so the waitress brought it over then she decid not to return for 1520 min we ask to tast two differ wine the waitress brought them over and my friend decid on one well the waitress then took away the tast glass still halfful this chick was in a zone we order the chicken soulvaki and the hummus trio the hummus was realli bad it was gritti and flavorless the chicken was so dri that my friend actual chock on it 
while tri to swallow our lunch we notic that the bus boy would leav the side dish on tabl if they look clean for the next guest to eat off of eeewww 
there we no towel in the bathroom when we got there so i told the waitress i went back to the bathroom about an hour later and still no towel i told the manag who was just as useless

i use to come here and sit on the patio with my dognev againi was so hungov our first morn at the mgm i couldnt even leav the hotel even though i should have 

manfriend and i decid to grab a bite at studio cafe after check out the menu

th onli star goe to our waiter jose who was veri polit and attentive

th food is a differ stori tell me whi werent both of our  hashbrown which i was look forward to the most even lukewarm it was cold and tast like cardboard the breakfast burrito was disgust took one bite and felt like throw up babe steak and egg didnt look too appeal either he like the steak but everyth els was a culinari disast from the lingerg old ladi perfum the food and my hangov i couldnt stand to sit there one more minut ask man if he didnt mind eat in the room becaus i was about to hurl right then and there grab jose as quick as we could paid 6000 for the worst food ive eaten in a long time 

should have yelp it befor hand but nonetheless never againthis place blow goats

on my recent trip to vega we were starvin like marvin and found this joint insid caesar we look at the menu and decid to eat there becaus the price were decent and we were readi to consum a cow

that was the biggest mistak of the night

talk about horribl everything

1 the food here is not fabul by ani standard and your go to pay more than you would at ani other hotel cafe 15 dollar for a measli quesadilla without chicken

2 the worst custom servic i have had in a long time we spent exact 2 hour here becaus they never brought us our check and it took almost an hour to get our food which was 2 salad and a quesadilla 

3 they doubl charg my credit card and i had to call them onc i got back to california they fix the problem two day later

mayb i caught them on a bad night but cmon that wast most of our first night there we end up at this other crappi place for drink later thank a lot augustus cafefor nothwowthi was absolut the worst din experi of our live  this wasnt our first brazilian steakhouse

w call befor to see if they took reserv  the girl who answer the phone was clueless  she didnt know the answer so we just ask how long the wait was sinc we were onli about 30 minut away  she start rambl about seat us mayb at tabl 30 or tabl 36 and then just paus for about 30 second  she final said there would be no wait

when we got there after a few minut we were seat  we wait about 5 minut and then our waiter came by and said hi how are you do  have you beenoh hold on this tabl was here first and then he turn around and start help a tabl across from us that actual just sat down  they had 6 peopl so he probabl expect a larger bill  after anoth 5 minut with them he came back to us and we order water and he explain that we turn the block to red when were eat salad bar and to green when we want meat  

we got our salad from the salad bar best part of the meal but it was still veri averag in our opinion  after anoth 5 minut we ask one of the server assist for our water and for some bread that come with all the meal  it took anoth 34 minut after that befor they brought our water  no bread  we got second on our salad bar and came back to the tabl  at that time we decid we want to start tri some meat with our salad bar item  i flip over the block to green  the waiter came by and flip back over the block and said no your not readi and kept on walk by  we were floor by his respons if they want us to wait until the side came they could have said it more tact  

a few minut later we push our salad to the side and flip over our block again to show we want our side and meat  they brought over our side rice bean fri banana and a few other thing  still no bread we ask again  they brought it a few minut later  so i put some rice and bean on my plate and wait for meat  they brought by our option of meat and put it on our plate we accept everi meat they brought by  i start eat and took a bite of my rice  i felt someth stringi in my mouth and proceed to pull out a long blond hair  we were disgust  i wait for our waiter to come by but after 5 minut he didnt show up  final a meat server came by and we ask him to get our waiter  he came by and i show him the hair he ask for it and examin it  he then look at us and said that no one in the kitchen has blond hairinf it wasnt from them  my wife and i both have brunett hair so we knew it wasnt our  he took away the rice and my plate and they brought by new rice and plate a few minut later  no apolog at this time  i didnt care for rice now and realli want to tri some more meat  i wait for about 78 minut until the next person came by with meat  they put a small portion on our plate and walk away never ask if we want more or a larger piec  none of the meat server do this and they all give tini piec  i ate that piec in 2 bite and wait again  this becam a pattern  it was usual about 10 minut between meat  shouldnt be this way  we mention this to our server and he said okay and walk away  after anoth 30 minut and onli 2 more piec of meat one was pineappl we said we had enough   it was extrem frustrat look around for someon to bring you meat and have to wait 10 minut between bite  

we told the waiter we were finish  they brought by dessert but after our experi we pass  a few minut pass and he drop the check on our tabl and said sorri bout the hair and walk away  we expect to see a discount tab howev it was for the full amount of 65  he came back by and we ask to speak to a manag  he walk over to one talk for a bit and then came back and said no manag was avail but i am avail  we told him how unhappi we were with the experi and that we didnt believ we should have to pay this enter amount  he then ask did you both eat you both ate food so you have to pay  we again explain how unhappi we were and brought up everyth that happend  he said there was noth he could do  we ask to speak to a manag  he said no there was noth they could do  we ask again and he got one the manag walk over and guess what she had long blond hair after we explain the even she rude ask if the waiter saw the hair then she said that they had peopl out and it was too busi and then said they couldnt do anyth about our tab  we argu and they final took half off

th reason whi we are so upset was the custom servic  place can have off night hair fall in food but the way they handl it was absolut pathet  save your  dont go herehead to fogo de chao instead this place is gross and not worth the price you will spend a lot at fogo de chao too but the qualiti and tast is sooooooo much better my hubbi and i tri this place out on a weeknight and we should have known to turn away when we saw onli 2 other tabl fill in the entir place  the qualiti of the meat was so cheap drychewi and tasteless the salad bar was small compar to fogo de chao but prob the best part of the entir meal and when you go to a brazilian restaur it suppos to be all about the meat and the meat suck ball here also our waiter was so dayum annoy we notic they had a giant brazilian flag and american flag hang on the wall by the bar and the american flag was all half hang onto the floor and we ask him if he could fix it sinc the flag was on the dayum ground and he remakr the owner is right there you can ask him yourself my hubbi and i look at each other like wtf so my husband did just that he walk over to the owner sit at the bar right next to the flag and ask him to fix the flag and he said sure right away and start fix it dumb waiter anyway dont wast your time or your money here the food is 2 thumb downi can honest say eat here was the worst dine experi i have ever had ive been to wors place ive dealt with wors servic but bundl togeth the entir experi of the even and top it with the hefti price tag for a bow and youv got someth you would wish on nobody

i had high hope for this place realli i did i recal go for lunch a coupl of time when they were fogo e brasa and they were veri good someth chang we saw our server who turn out to be the manag onli onc mean no drink refil the person bring the meat around could best be describ as a meat pusher he would butt his way into our convers mumbl what he had then start saw without ask if we want ani the meat was inconsist bad i saw everyth from overcook to the point of burn to someth that look like it was in the pan for no more than 15 second add to that an appar total lack of season and you get a rather unappet meal

for this love experi we were charg 31 each not includ ani drink or dessert this is the first time i honest consid walk out on a check i will never be return here and am make sure to spread the word of just how bad that dinner was i actual went to applebe afterward to get some better food in me yes applebe was bettertook a parti of 6 here for dinner last night 
1  expens  33person drink 750 ea and dessert are extra  forc 18 gratuiti for 6 or more
2  food was mediocr  meat was veri salti  difficult to tell if you were eat ham or turkey becaus it was all the same flavorsalti  
3  servic was veri good
4  we were overcharg 128 had to return to have it correct  we were charg for 9 peopl not 6  pay veri close attent to your bill  read review belowthey seem to do this frequently
first and last visit for uswe came here for dinner the other night and we werent over impress and honest im quit surpris by some of the higher review 

the atmospher was fine low light decent decor but it was much smaller than i had expect it was also near empti when we first got there at 6pm

servic was decent a coupl of the server were hard to understand but we got by now i understand the whole concept of how the server will keep come with the meat  until you turn over the littl color toy look thing but it was a bit distract to have a convers when the server are circl around you and interrupt mayb it would be better to just bring out a dish of the sampl and if you want more then you could ask for it

th salad bar wasokay it wasnt anyth to rave about i tri a sampl of six differ salad mushroom tilapia and tomato chicken salad egg salad crab salad and garbanzo bean salad of the six i thought two of them were good chicken salad and egg salad

aft we finish with the salad they start bring in the meat again we thought they were okay the beef were definit way better than the other i like the prime rib the sirloin and the fillet howev they were a bit over cook for my tast but they were season well and moist although the sausag was dri the ham was soso the pork chop was complet dri out the lamb i didnt care for and the piec of rib i got didnt realli have ani meat on it
they also brought rice bean some other sauc and a small dish of fri banana i didnt tri the bean or whatev the sauc was but i did tri the rice it was plain noth excit plus it was slight undercook i got a few crunchi piec the fri banana were realli good though

w had the flan for dessert it was actual realli good keep in mind though flan is pretti easi to make but it was tasty

i think that it a great concept and would be an enjoy experi if the qualiti was better while im glad we at least tri it becaus it alway good to tri someth new i doubt well ever be back the price we paid wasnt worth it unless they lower their price to 20 a person i probabl wouldnt come back i think it would be a better idea to take your money to one of your favorit steakhouses

now i was go to give this restaur a 2 mayb 3 star rate howev after read other review and see how the manag of brazilian bull respond to negat review i chang it to a 1 star rate 
tip to the manag if you want peopl to return after a bad experi be rude disrespect and extrem defens is not the way to do it be argument and tri to prove a point wont help your restaur and you should keep in mind word of mouth is a power tool learn some custom servic and common courtesia few week ago i went in for a lunch to use a villag voic deal 15 for 30 i purchas i order the grill burrito with no dairi top with red sauc with a side of guaccamus the server suggest grill veget insid so i agre when my order came out i remind the server for the side of guaccamus and she told me the cook put it insid on accid i said it was fine and proceed to cut into the burrito insid i discov no rice a few bean basic a grill veget runni guaccamus mess she came by so i apolog for be difficult but point out this is not what i order and wasnt what i want it she apolog and told me the cook had made it wrong the first time so this was his second tri and she took it back onc my food came out the burrito has shrunk half to it origin size but it was 230 so i thank her and ate it anyway she took my burrito off the check so onc again i had the villag voic deal to use

yesterday i call and told the woman on the phone i had the coupon and i want to place a togo order i order the togo guaccamus which is on the menu under a la cart ive order it befor so i know it come in a larg contain i also order chicken lettuc wrap the woman on the phone said i could get the lunch order for cheaper and half the size sinc i was onli order for myself but look to spend 30 on the coupon i agre with her suggest so as a second thought i told her i would take the taco salad as well no dairi dress on the side she ask if i want chicken and i calcul that this would put me over 30 so i could run a tip on my debit card so onc again i agre with her suggestion

when i got to the restaur i present the girl at the bar with my coupon and as she was give me a receipt for 27 i was bombard by a fluster rude older man in a dress shirt practic shout at me it was dinein onli i explain to him that i had been there befor to tri and use it but my order was wrong so is there anyway i could be made an except he grab my receipt and went to the regist and brought me back a receipt for 2 say the order went over the total i felt bad so i tip her 7 he walk away and i remind her i told her about it on the phone she took the blame and apolog i was realli uncomfort so i went back to my car befor i left check my order

th first box had the half order of chicken lettuc wrap check the second was the taco salad which appear to me to be iceberg lettuc and grill chicken on top with no much els no dress then i open the third contain which had one side of guaccamus and a million fri wonton chip so i went back insid becaus the one thing i realli want the togo guaccamus was wrong onc again i was bombard by this older man yell at the server across the bar she would have to ring me up separ while she told me that i order the guaccamus a la cart and so that is what i order my receipt was still on the bar so i open it up and look at the bill i had been rung up for a full order of chicken lettuc wrap the taco salad plus chicken and one side of guaccamus which obvious is not what i order at this point i was start to get angri so i just grab my food and left it was onc i got back to my offic that i realiz i had paid 9 on top of the 15 i alreadi paid for my villag voic deal for a side of guacamol some wonton i didnt want three small lettuc wrap and the worst salad id ever seen

nev againthe cupcak are ok theyr not that great but the reason i rate one star is becaus of the aw and snooti custom servic by the employe work the front counters

i didnt get their name but the guy and girl work are just aw i dont understand how small busi can afford to give horribl custom servic in time like these or anytim for that matter

i definit will not be come back to the cupcakerithe wife and i use to frequent the santan locat often when we live in mesa we alway had great servic and the place was alway clean

howev after move to to the n phx area we tri this locat as it was the nearest

w were in for a shock it was a complet differ experience

w were seat fair quick and immedi notic that the bbq sauc assort look as it had not been clean in year everi one of the contain had crusti discolor sauc cake on the tip it was disgust but sinc we dont eat the sauc we were will to overlook that

th tabl was not clean it had obvious gotten the two second wipe down this is unaccept at a bbq place where most food is messy

so the food i cant comment on this as we were never serv or even wait on

w sat in our booth for a solid 1015 minut watch sever of the wait staff walk by us look at us and do nothing

th most annoy part were the seater they had 34 seater huddl around the littl podium and one the talllarg one kept look at us it was obvious she knew what was go on other tabl around us even notic we had not been wait on none of the seater bother to do anyth there was no manag in sight either

w got up and proceed to the door when the taller seater woman blurt out leav already

i turn and said we have been wait for 15 minut and have not even seen a waitress she kinda gave a whatev look and said have a great day


so after frequent the santan locat and receiv noth but great servic and a clean place to eat we are not go back to the peoria locat we drove 10 mile to get there and had to take our money elsewher becaus they couldnt be bother to serv us 

we frequent place we like and get good servic we eat out near everi night as we both have busi career and dont like to cook famous dave peoria lost out on regular custom and we will not recommend them to ani of our cowork or frienddamn pierr review of the health code violat brought this from a five to a one ick ick ick ick ick

southern style indian food all vegetarian and vegan

aft have a few game of buckhunt at the stray cat and perhap a pitcher of miller high lifei wont front my companion and i decid we were hungri not want to resort to four peak in temp for food he suggest green restaurantfin a flexatarian def someon who enjoy not eat meat at everi meal and understand that a person may not eat meat and still like food who understood my lactoseintoler wasnt just to be difficult

so we stop by greenand they are close on sunday damn

w drive down scottsdal road sadden by the raini sunday night and he spot this indian restaur i pictur creami paneer and chickeni kormasuhuh folk all vegetarian and vegan

w are welcom warm to a full hous and realiz quick we are the onli white peopl there score i order us the appet samplerwhich is huge i mean it had four sauc the cilantro coconut tamarindand some kind of chutney pakora samosa lentil etc we end up cut them all in half and take them home i had the dosai with potato onion chutney pea and spice and love it i love tamarind sauc and i think the staff was pleas i did caus they give me a shitload he order a kind of dosai with chees in it and it tast yummybut eerili like an enchilda i also convinc him to indulg in the mango lassi god i miss those dairi yogurti drink and it was tastynot that sweet and mayb a bit yogurti than necessari but realli cool down the mouth when had too much of the spici chutney

th bathroom was nice the staff was great the decor was simpli all the indian famili were happi i was happi he was happi and i had about 100 vegan item to choos from whi the hell did i wait so long to go here pleas check it outchris s person attack me for dislik cucina tagliani  so i would definit listen to him when he ask you to consid the valid of these review  it may be upset for chris to read such hatr in review but it is more upset to get a messag full of hate person attack  i hope chris isnt the owner he seem to be mighti emot over the whole thing  im not the onli one who hate this place chris  are you go to attack us allthe wife and i went to captain bill with friend in late august we had heard that the food would not impress us but that the view of the lake would be worth tri the place wrong

let me start with the view the littl bit of the lake that we could see was well pretti lame it definit was not an impress view so that reason for go was no longer valid

th food oh the food it was quit liter the worst food that the wife and i have had in year i order the shrimp scampi sinc it a seafood restaur onli to be told that the pasta would count as one of my side what shrimp scampi alway come on pasta but captain bill nickl and dime me on the pasta lame oh and the pasta was so complet undercook that i end up onli have 2 small bite befor push it away in disgust i mean it wasnt even close to be cook as much as al dente

th wife hate her meal coconut shrimp and our friend realli did not enjoy their meal either

w will never go back to captain bill and i do not recommend that you do eitheri wish i could review their foodbut i cant  whi you ask  becaus my parti never got seated

mi friend rayna was nice to give this place 2 star but i cant even do that  i was so disppoint by the whole experi especi sinc i was look forward to my first tapa experi ever  i was over the moon excit but the servic was such a let down i dont think i would ever give it a second chance

i am not tri to be ms whinyp here i understand the whole sit with other at the tabl concept  when my two friend and i show up for my friend birthday parti we were greet right away  we said that we had a parti of 6 and they will be there in less than 5 minut  the hostess explain that we could sit at the bar and wait but she couldnt seat us until our whole parti arriv  she did point out that there was seat for 6 peopl and she was go to reserv it for us but she couldnt hold it until the whole parti arrived

wel while we were wait a coupl walk in and ask to be seat  there were other place for them to be seatedbut she chose to seat them at our reserv spot  after that while we were still stand there she ignor us  didnt explain to us that she had to seat them there or anyth  we were just complet ignor  even when she notic that anoth person in our parti arriv an explan would have been nice 


we thought it was unprofession and lost the custom servic appeal altogh  we felt like she chose 2 peopl or 6  

so we left and decid to have a fantas experi at barrio cafereview come sooni dont give out mani one star you have to realli fail to get that but our trip to café bellagio  brunch fail

sinc my friend and i were too hungri for crepe at jean philipp patisseri but not hungri enough to tackl the buffet our option for brunch at the bellagio were rather limit  after wander around the casino to check out ani other altern we end up at café bellagio sinc the line was relat short and they were abl to sit our group of nine pretti quickly

i order the corn beef hash and it came with a decent amount of food  homemad corn beef hash two poach egg hash brown and choic of toast  the egg and hash brown were fine but the hash itself didnt do much for me  while their generos with the amount of meat they use would usual be a good thing it felt like i was eat a salti corn beef patti than an actual corn beef hash  iron their attempt to make it a hash didnt help either as the shred of potato they threw in tast a bit undercooked

although i might have given the food two star on it own im give a one becaus i thought the servic wasnt entir thereliter  after bring out our food our server seem to disappear for long stretch  we had to motion sever time to get our bill and onc we did get it one of my friend had to practic hunt them down to give them our check  after what felt like 1015 minut our server final return with our credit card  and slipsbut onli the merchant copi none for us to keep  rather than wait around to ask for our copi we just sign and left

consid the qualiti of food and servic id rather take the 14 i spent on my hash and head over to hash hous for someth bigger and better for the same priceveri veri poor manag 

we were there last year for the sun playoff game and wait in line for a seat like the other 25 peopl some yanni look dousch and his fake as hell trailer trash barbi wanna be walk in ask for the manag proceed to yank his jock and get a tabl in less then 1 min 

i walk right over to the same manag while he was schmooz the dousch and ask whi they were so special noth like burst the ego of a semifam dousch the manag was so embarrass he escort me off the floor and proceed to tell me they spend so much money here everi year that they deserv prefer treatment 

i walk out and told everi other person who was wait what had happen and out of 25 peopl at least 18 went somewher els 

i sure hope the vip was worth the 500 they lost out on when we all walk not to mention the bad press and no repeat busisave your money and eat a hot dog while watch the gamethe dim sum is mediocr but the price were moder we were seat right away but after that there was no custom servic whatsoev we had to ask multipl time for someon to bring us water and tea someth that is usual done right away without be request the ladi that walk around with push cart kept ask if we want anyth but how are we suppos to eat when the basic havent been cover yet i have never receiv such lack luster servic from a dim sum restaur i would probabl return again if they improv their waitstaff but the likelihood of that is not like sorri but youll just have to tri again becaus for now you faili would give this place 5 frownni face   

where should i begin first of all they open at 10am but dont have ani food readi we place an order for a few dim sum at 1010 am and got our order at 11am unaccept realli 50 min for dim sum server could bare speak english mess up our order and manag was too busi to care 

also the worst part is dim sum cart ladi drop food on the wet dirti ground and proced to place it back on the plate and back into the cart to be serv to unknow custom gross ladygross i had to ask her to throw it away and she at first said  it okay wth no ladi it not okay no worri i made sure she threw it in the trashwher it belong 

final we get our food at 11 after ask multipl time and our consol prize for their mistak were some cooki woohoo probabl the one that fell on the floor
 serious do not eat here81111

after read so mani review about how great maggiano happi hour was i decid to check it out myself and use a 10 gift card that maggiano had sent to me in honor of my birthday  yes im write this review almost two year later i am that backlog with review and photo bear with me  i dont think that these should be discount base on how long it been sinc these visit becaus i and other could use these observ to see if the restaur and their servic and product have improv or in some case worsen  

was go to tri a coupl of the app when i spot the fourchees ravioli httpwwwyelpcombizphotosmaggianoslittleitalyscottsdale3selectgzmwrgnr3im5etxgk5rfiqgzmwrgnr3im5etxgk5rfiq on the dinner menu  the descript mention ricotta cream chees mozz and provolon in a pestoalfredo cream sauc and i was hook ricotta pesto and alfredo hook me in 95 of the time  unfortun the dish was a huge letdown httpwwwyelpcombizphotosmaggianoslittleitalyscottsdale3selectdmecy1zfqidngrglm1e3sadmecy1zfqidngrglm1e3sa  all but two of the ravioli were halffrozen especi at the edg and the flavor  all of the chees marinara sauc and pestoalfedo cream sauc tast the same  all bland without ani distinct between them  i tast sampl from allov the plate from all compon separ and togeth and couldnt discern ani differ  even the entre appear was subpar  suffic it to say i have not step foot into anoth maggiano since

th two good comment i could say are that the restaur was quiet no one was there and the plate were quaintlook with that oldfashion roseandbon tint floral printwaaaaaaaah and grrrrrrrrrrr
id leav it at that but i think you need to hear just whi i am so pain 

honey and i decid to go all out for a biggi new year dinner extravaganza it had been a while sinc we got all gussi and spent the big buck we were due for some eyerol tablethomp delici 

perus the short list of our local fave we both spi the prixfix at sassi and did a littl danc limit menus at a swank venu usual equat to except dish well worth the limited of it all we want them to bring it we deserv it

w arriv just a few minut late even got a cardriv so as to be sate and safe and were immedi seat the restaur was not crowd we like our tabl and saddl up as is alway the case a predinn cocktail was order while perus the menu a few minut later our martini arriv pour at the tabl and we were left to make our new year toast enter click glass rais to lipsscreeeeech excus me miss sorri you were given the wrong drink no big deal it happens

w order our cours with delight and within minut the appet cours appear this was a trio of select appet all tasti and complementari our empti plate were quick whisk away along with our silverwar and whallah a second plate of the same appet appear er um we just had this cours no big deal it happen 

minut go by and here come the appropri second cours the plate were deliv and we alltol realiz our silverwar was not replac a few minut of tri to discreet flag someon down and then on to the eat salmon  yum sausag pretti yum neither as noteworthi as expect but so far so good 

next was the high anticip lobster gnocchi cours we didnt bother to order two differ entre we both want this to ourselv oooooh here it come be care these plate are hot oh wait this is wrong these are the select for the next cours where is my lobster gnocchi 

hot plate remov hmmmm start to waver between angri and sad lobster gnocchi arriv noth a littl lobster cant fix right  
well wrong overcook tough shard of lobsterbut wors the gnocchi black was so overpow with anis that we could bare get it down it was one of the most terribl dish i have had in age we were destroy and we eat everyth 

oh goodi here come the hot plate we were serv 10 minut ago now it been a good 20 minut under the warmer anoth warn for extrem hot plate im not sure there is ever a time for appreci this save for a castiron skillet or ooey gooey mexican fare that actual tast better when all fire up well it cool a bit consid we had to wait yet again for someon to return with silverwar 

mi sea bass was fine it wasnt great the plate didnt offer much for textur rice with saute spinach and fish mush and mush honey veal was terribl tasteless overcook disc of mysteri meat posit next to the most horrif attempt at truffl potato gratin the main reason he order the dish we have ever been serv 

bi this time we just want out the servic the food the whole night was throw us into a funk that was so undeserv for the price and the holiday dessert was shock unspectacular two unfinish plate and i have a mouth full of sweet teeth were proof that the meal didnt even end well 

so over 400 later the joke was on us we were so distraught we decid to call the car earli and just go home in bed by 1145 instead of ring in the new year at the bar at sassi enough said 

a year ago sassi butternut squash ravioli haunt me now i wake up in cold sweat dream i have to endur new year eve all over againhow can a fellow yelper rate this as a 5 and me a 1 mayb it was an off day

thi place is absolut beauti 

the servic was averag to slow consid i was 1 of 3 tabl 

the chip were bland and the salsa was crap if you took strain can tomato and ad an onion powder from the dollar store and a littl salt that was the salsa total crap 

i order the appit combo think it would be a good way to sampl a littl of everyth that was the thought 

it had a mole type cover enchilada with chicken in it the mole was decent but it was veri sweet no spice at all mayb this was dessert
th roll taco thing had zero flavor the chimi was alright but anyth fri with sour cream on top is the sope or whatev was ok but again had zero flavor the bean had zero flavor the chees which i think was cojita was good but not enough on anyth 

i realli like the decor but would have prefer the chicken from the guy cook out front of the store 

total disappoint i think this is my first 1 star for a busi that is still openlolso i figur out whi this place has 5 from one and 1 from anoth 

it is own ny our friend up north yep the super nice yet bland group we call canadian they have creat a tourist trap that appeal to tourist and lover of sw crap 

lol

her is a copi of the busi plan 

let creat a super nice place that attract peopl to it eah cuz they end the sentenc with a question
but we do know anyth about mexican food
let make it so neat just to be in the place that we will get by on our look eah
okaay make sure the drink are goodit been almost ten month sinc mike c  i stop in here for the weekday lunch buffet so it seem time to give the place an updat  back then the buffet was soso  i gave it 3star  this time i purpos came to order from the regular menu hope to get them up to 4star  as you see it didnt work out

you enter this place to a huge stylish patio that look as if it should have littl swap meet booth go along the side but it noth was happen with them when i was there  the insid of the restaur is larg too with big comfort booth along the side  larg tabl that you could scoot togeth for a big quinceañera or whatev out in the center

you take your seat  receiv a generous bowl of good chip  a too littl bowl of mild but tasti salsa to go along  no problem theyll bring me more salsa when it run out  ok so far were at 4star but now thing start go cuesta abajo pronto

  first off for my server i get señor unfriend    o

  i had read the menu on their websit befor i came in  knew that i want to order a chile relleno  taco combo for 799  so far as i write this review it still right here 

wwwtradicionesrestaurantcom

then click menus doubleclick the ani of the menu page select print all page open menupdf  go to page 4

  it was exact 11 am  the menu abov said serv from 11 am to 3 pm daili as you see if it still up but they hand me a dinner onli menu  tri to charg me way more for the same thing    

  manag mr canada confirm that i have been given a dinner onli menu in violat of his own written publish polici  that what he want me to have

  i refus to pay the higher price so mr c tell them to give me the 799 price this time but that they need to fix the websit right away    o

  in a littl while mr unfriend bring my plate but it has a chicken taco on it rather than the shred beef taco that i order    

  i dont want to make mr u ani wors than he alreadi is have just seen the movi machet so i dont say anyth about receiv the wrong taco but i do final get up the nerv to ask him for some more salsa to replac the tini bowl that he has alreadi clear seen empti  whi did i have to ask

too mani problem here  it especi not ok for a busi to tri  cheat me on the money  one fing starserious i am stun at whi there are so mani good review about this place ill start by say that i would normal give a place a second tri if it wasnt the best experi as there re mani factor as to what can go wrong on ani night of servic but this was so far less than mediocr that i dont have ani desir to go back 

from the start when my group of 4 walk in at 8pm the bar was pack but the booth were near empti as we took a stroll to look around we did not get seat right away but we were earli 

the server didnt approach our tabl for near 10 minut after we sat and was in the vicin at least 4 time final  she arriv and after order 3 martini that all came in complet differ fashion than order and take 15 minut to get that sort out it was at least 25 minut befor the server return again she was a mess and it didnt get better 

i had the wedg salad which was just fine and my friend all had the soup of the day  jambalaya which isnt soup and actual was gumbo by my account and was actual veri good a friend had a caesar that he said tast stale it tast over fishi to me and unbalanc we had it taken away which is how he end up with the gumbo jambalaya soup thing

for the main cours we order 3 steak and a seafood pasta dish the  steak were veri poor qualiti i mean the ribey was 32  and while that isnt the most expens price for a steak of that sort it a pretti hefti price tag for a garbag piec of meat  it was all fat not marbl even and not veri good grain to the meat at all just trash i liter had 3 bite were it not for the martini and the 2 glass of wine i may have care more but i was share with my friend and she switch with me for the seafood pasta 

everi singl scallop we count 6  was sandi which to my knowledg mean unwash or from a can and unwash the sauc was meant to be some form of scampi i thought but it was wateri and thin and just not that good ani of these complaint were not regist becaus the server never came back to check on us

ok longest stori short the server didnt return to the tabl until the check was drop the busser basic took care of us until that point not onli was the caesar salad on the check but she ad an 18 gratuiti to the bill  is this standard practic for sub par servic and food she was no where to be found and my companion decid to leav it sinc we  would not be return 

i would not consid go to this place ever again unless someth drastic happen like it chang ownership honest it was badsummary
when this buffet first came out i was will to stand in line for an hour just to eat here now even with the local 25 off special i doubt id ever come back the lobster tail went from big and juici to small and dri speak of dri that word could be use to describ most of the seafood a lot of the pictur are a littl old and show the buffet at it prime if your think about eat here id suggest go in and see the select for what it is now

notes
        lobster tail  with the except of the sterl brunch at balli this is the onli buffet i know that serv lobster tails
        befor  when this place first open the lobster tail look like this httpwwwyelpcombizphotosrvntfeq7r2zhg0cybbnfwselectqhfhdsvrrpcvmzfgdcobqg
        now  now the lobster tail look like this tini thing between the clam strip and the scallop httpwwwyelpcombizphotosrvntfeq7r2zhg0cybbnfwselectammom91rywalkaux1l0aa
        crab leg  they have both hot and cold crab leg they are definit larger than the crab leg at the carniv world buffet howev the hot crab leg were dri and the cold crab legswel are cold
        oyster  i grab two oyster and i could onli eat one they tast like theyd gone bad
        crawfish  dri and not fresh
        sashimi  they have salmon white fish and tuna the onli fresh seafood item i could find httpwwwyelpcombizphotosrvntfeq7r2zhg0cybbnfwselectt4iokj7ei9oh2fj1ypzuda

        dessert  the dessert are realli good they have a spin gelato wheel and some of the higher end dessert youd expect like creme brule
recommendations
        i wouldnt recommend this place at it current condit if they bring back the qualiti they use to have id easili pay 50 howev i doubt they willdo you want to puke out of your mouth and ass at almost the same time  then definit pay the exorbit price to eat at best mediocr food at the rio casino seafood buffet

perhap i was ask for it becaus i went around 845  the person at the front assur me that they will continu to bring out food until 930  they did continu to bring out food but the less popular dish just sat there and sat there

i dont understand whi peopl come here

al you can eat lobster  not found  i think i may have found it but thought it was crawfish
al you can eat oyster  not fresh  avoid not fresh oyster at all cost  they say oyster are an afrodisiac but there noth sexi in watch someon puke
al you can eat king crab leg  not found  serious where was this  i onli found snow crab leg  no king crab found
al you can eat seafood  yes but again not fresh  i found the seafood was more fresh at the bachann buffet at caesar although the varieti was not as good as here  but whi pay more to eat such crap food  if your here strict for quantiti or your someon who like to puke after eat a ton of food i can kind of understand

even if i didnt get sick i would not suggest come here  spend the extra to go to bachann at caesar  it so much better and has enough seafood option to keep you satisfi  if you did the buffet of buffet promot it definit not worth the extra fee to eat here

so after i becam ill someon suggest that i contact custom servic  i sent them an email tell them that i got food poison from their buffet and they repli ask me to call some risk manag team and they will open up an investig  i would have prefer if they just refund the extra money i paid as part of their buffet of buffet deal  but call their number and speak with them for a mere 10 is not worth the effort  so rio you win  take my 10  i hope my puke and crap somehow clog up your sewag pipewent there on a friday night on a holiday weekend friend arrang us a limo to get there this place look veri nice from outsid with all those nice statu i like the decor they have a steakhous restaur on site we never tri though but our friend said it was not bad

it is a big club 2 big stage downstair we were taken upstair to our reserv tabl there was a small stage there and a few vip danc box 

i didnt realli like the showgirl there most of them are older not what i expect and the drink suck bad we paid 25 each for 2 drink ticket but they were onli good for well drink light beer hous wine cheap vodka yike we had to buy better drink those drink were still so bad i suspect they were water down or something

ther were veri few attract girl danc on the stage they did bring lot of girl upstair for entertain a coupl of them tri to give hubbi lap danc but when they saw me they were like  you are so pretti and just ran away  wth i came here for lap danc too that was veri unpleas indeed

wouldnt go back again  pizza good  servic good  atmospher good  what i didnt appreci  be follow outsid  accus of not leav a tip on a 116 bill  we left 38  funni thing is our group of 6 were all restaur managersserv and would never think of leav less than 20 on a bill for just ehhhh servic  want great pizza great servic great atmospher  tri pizza brutta on monro street  am unaffili by the way just my neighborhood pizza joint that never dissappointfuck 3 root ive been go there for about three year and i realli want to like it but everi time i go back i am remind of whi i hate it

3 root wouldnt be so terribl if a the employe had the first clue about what constitut good servic and b if everyth wasnt so wild inconsistent

i rememb a time a coupl year ago when the food at 3 root was realli realli good they must have chang their recip over time or have perhap hire unqualifi kitchen staff becaus thing that i use to love order now suck i got a grill chees a few month ago that was not actual grill it was toast bread with chees and it cost me 6 what the fuck

moreov it rare to get a good drink at 3 root of cours it all depend on whos make it there doesnt seem to be a standard modus operandi among the barista so you never know if your drink is go to suck or not more often than not it will i do not like starbuck but they make better coffe for about the same price

worst of all though is the servic 3 root barista wouldnt know good custom servic if it was fuck them in the ass there have been mani mani employe at 3 root over the year and almost everi one of them has made it realli clear that they couldnt care less about their patron  this is especi true if you arent friend with someon who work there person anecdot a few year ago i date a guy who was friend with mani of the barista there and when we broke up one of them was an overt catti bitch to me awesom you will consist be made to wait far longer for your food than necessari even if youv just order soup that need onli to be ladl into a bowl an hour wait for a sandwich or veggi burger is not uncommon youll probabl also have to ask for whatev side chip or whathaveyou was suppos to come with your food becaus theyll probabl forget to put it on your plate

oh and good luck find somewher to sit around lunchtime

and on top of all this they dont seem to be abl to run a busi and actual keep it open they close for month at a time to do god know what i never know when theyr go to be open and it realli not even worth bother anymorbe advis  a group of 4 employe where i work and some vendor that took them to the euro cafe in dowtown gilbert were diagnos with food poison just last week  
a few have been treat at the hospit while other are home fight through it   veri serious  the proper author were notifi and are collect data of everyon affect for the depart of healthmy friend and i are happi hour regular around central phoenix  were alway in search of a good deal and good fooddrink  the good deal was found at half moon the good food was not  we order 4 appet to share dure our recent happi hour and i was complet underwhelm  

the pretzel  the high point of the app simpl tasti  perhap a littl too salti but nonetheless yummy

chip with queso  queso  realli  more like microwav velveeta with some salsa stir in  just scream process food  there are so mani place with a qualiti queso dip around  half moon should ask for a recip suggestion

boneless wing  not bad  fair tasti littl nugget  unfortun there were onli about 6 tini littl piec  they obvious price them high to make up for your happi hour savings

fritochili nacho thing  realli that it just a hand of frito with some seem can chili pour over the top  so bore 

half moom pleas pleas pleas dont reli on your happi hour price and big tvs to bring peopl back  without decent food i definit have no incent to returnwhat a coloss let down this place was from begin to end my boyfriend propos just prior to dinner here so it realli wasnt go to take a lot to impress me i was so far on cloud 9 that liter everyth would have to go wrong for me to hate this place  

short version dont wast your time or money  

i did my research befor choos eat here so i knew what to expect a great view with mediocr food i knew we were pay for the view  

mi fianc that weird book a reserv through open tabl and follow up with email to top of the world staff to confirm a window seat for dinner all was set except when we got there we did not have a window seat not a huge deal but when i have alreadi accept i might be sacrif food qualiti for ambianc i want the unobstruct view 

they quot us 20 minut to get a window seat so we kill time in the bar upstair where we were prompt ignor 20 minut turn into 50 minut i get that not their fault but had they not mess up in the first place this wouldnt have happen we had reserv after dinner so their mess up put up back one hour and we had  to rush through dinner  if they had been more honest with their quot time we wouldnt have wait  who want to spend over 250 on dinner and rush through it

w final sit down for dinner and both order the 70 steak medium well for 70it should come out as request mine was rare so obvious rare to anyon who even look at it i sent it back and knew it would come back like leather which it did so disappoint 

at that point not even a view of the strip could salvag the meal 

definit not go back and would onli recommend this place if you actual enjoy throw your money awaythere is no view worth the price of the drink the rude of the servic and the purgatorylik experi of tri to get inout of the place on the overwhelm elev system

pick a tall hotel take an elev up as far as you can look out a hallway window donei dont know what to say about this restaur i can see the one who give good rate are either local or tourist if you live in la do skip this sorri ass korean bbq restaur you will be disappoint first of all the custom servic suck ball we purchas this groupon deal ask the waitre if we can use it toward the all you can eat option she rude said no we need ask for a few minut to decid what we want that the groupon cover which is noth becaus we realli want some bbq oh their regular price bbq plate are 20 per plate and you must order at least 2 order serious what the fuck whi do i have to order 2 order if we onli want 1 anyway we decid to just pay for the all you can eat deal for 2195 per person the waitre came back and i told her we want the all you can eat option she then snatch the advertis from the tabl and said your groupon will not cover it i rude said we cant just fuck pay for it she then put the advertis back i was so piss then told my boyfriend right in front of the waitre fuck this place let go we then left she brought out water alreadi but that too bad for her restaur like this doesnt deserv ani custom period 

she also said someth about the menu how there the la style i want to say your restaur will not surviv in la 

like i said if you are from la skip it becaus it a total ripoff and the servic suck llama balldespit the rave review about the sisig i dont think ill ever make a trip back here
th overal ambianc if you can call it that is not veri invit in my opinion it dark with minim decor and parti style tabl the bouncer there was just chillin at the bar and the bartend was just as inattent to ani potenti custom come through the door

i went on a weekday at about 8 in the even the onli peopl in there was a group that consist of about 4 older filipino men id say around hmm mid 30s to earli 40s and a bunch of young girl somewher around their 20s them  and a middl age coupl 

anyway i was have a good time with my 2 girlfriend sing karaok and such i was stoke becaus i actual got the coupl to slow danc when i sang crazi by patsi cline my friend amber sang a britney spear jam just so i wasnt hog the mic well i was up there for the 3rd time sinc uh there was no one els in there and our other friend maria didnt want to sing then sudden as i was approach the last line of i will surviv by gloria gaynor the dj cut my song off and decid to introduc one of the girl sit with the filipino mafia or whatev say she has a cd come out 

realli well whatev perfect time just when amber was about to tip the dj he cut me off no more not sinc he pull that stunt 

so i sat down with my friend and we attempt to listen to this girl suppos skill on the mic and i have to say im not the best singer but i was definit better than her 

im give this place one star not onli for the horribl dj but for the horribl servic and under servic restroom not to mention the uncar workerdont believ the hype i am here at 5am after drive pretti far outta the way and they are close 11 veri unhappi third shifter disappoint to say the least and we will not be back with our business

th smart ass girl smoke right in front of the door laugh exclaim well not exact 24 hour on monday  thursday wish i would have read that statement on the websiti get a comment from the owner of this pile of poo

com from aaron l of philadelphia sandwich compani 962011
thank you for take the time to write about your experience

what great custom servic instead of at least tri to correct the matter andor apolog i receiv sarcasm well thank you mr aaron l of philadelphia sandwich compani with that retort ill take it with a grain of salt which you shouldv use in make some real food id like to take one star away for obvious reasons

and yes ill be stop in again just to see if you can prove me wrongokay so ill start off by say i use to love this place  when i was withchild their sandwich and hash brown woke me up at night   on the corner of 5th and scottsdal the joint was uber cool with extra umlaut for extra cool   the vibe was hip and friend   this use to be a 5 star joint  

what happen  we knew they were move to craftsman court  we were expect someth great  but it was just the opposit  ah man what a signific disast   biggest disappoint so far this year

th outsid window were dark it was hard to tell if the place was even open   we enter to an awkward and misplac drum kit   there was no clear indic of what to do  is this counter servic  it hard to tell  we end up order at what appear to be a bar  or a counter  or someth else

half of the space is decor with philli jazz poster dark wood a high brow style bar and a coffe machin   the other half had a general hippi feel  the space was split by a red billiard tabl smack in the middl  i tell you this place has a real person disord   and the place was filthi 

i almost immedi regret step foot in the space  it was dirti  was that construct dust all over the floor and tabl  should we be eat here   reluct i order the 12 sandwich lunch special   after a good 25 minut i  inquir about get our food togo and was prompt respond to with a good dose of stinkey from dj slash cashier  what a mess

with the new store philadelphia sandwich co miss some of the key concept critic to stay aliv in the restaur biz  includ basic layout and flow  the lunch crowd was nonexist on a wednesday afternoon with onli 3 other diner   one gentleman came in and prompt turn around to leav  i have to say im a bit concern with their product turnov with that littl traffic at a normal busi time the food cant stay fresh for long   

the vibe up all night like a dirti pancak and not in a good way   the space filthi and not in a sexi way  the food now taint   i hope the after 2am crowd can turn a blind eye and save this joint  i know my outallnight nosh would rather be at the aw hous than herewhat an underwhelm dine experi this was my first time ever stif a waitress the servic was so crappi that i honest felt she should tip me for put up with her for my meal 

we arriv at juli 18th around 710pm we were greet by a notsosmiley hostess and seat at an extrem wobbl tabl we sat unacknowledg for at least 58 minut without be offer a menu water bread ect onc we were greet we let our server know that we had an 830 pm movi to catch she took our drink order 5 minut went by and then she came back to let us know they were out of glenlivet  12 18 and glenfiddich scotch accept she doesnt do the liquor order we pick new drink but when i final got my margarita i immedi told her that i couldnt tast anyth but straight sweet  sour she laugh kind of roll her eye and said she would get me more tequila she did not mention she was charg me for a premium tequila shot i have been a bartend on the strip for awhil now so i know what a margarita should tast like 

at this point i look around the restaur i took note that the peopl next to us had a black pizza i decid to avoid that entre and i mention to my bf that mayb we should just leav becaus i didnt see this place as improv my menu was also insert backward my place set didnt have a napkin and our waitress seem not interest in wait on us so mayb they just suck 

25 minut into our meal we final got water  bread our order were taken and we were place we dont see our server for awhil 810 pm roll around 20 min until our movi and we final see our waiter we ask her what up we say we are probabl go to just have to skip the movi and she say what it onli like 8pm she then smirk and walk over to the hostess stand wouldnt the right thing to do be go check on our food at this point we are kind of frustrat becaus we feel we gave them plenti of time to cook a salmon and a piec of veal 

815 our food final arriv we tri to eat it super quick not exact how you want to eat dinner the food was decent i felt my spinach was slight over salt but i ate it my boyfriend like his dish we may actual have given this place a second tri if our waitress wasnt so snotti and slow we didnt have time for an app or dessert although you think an hour and a half would be enough time for a casual italian place 

she didnt offer my bf anoth scotch even though his was clear gone 

the surpris came when we got the bill our waitress had charg us for an extra patron shot i was pretti furious whi not becaus we cant afford to have as mani shot of patron as we want but becaus my margarita was absolut wrong in the first place and the extra shot cost 12 somehow more than the margarita itself 11 we ask to talk to a manag becaus we thought mayb he may want to know his server wasnt up to par she wouldnt bring him over so we left i would feel horribl for her support staff for not tip but to be honest i didnt see a busser or anyth they actual didnt prebus our bread plate or our chees plate at all 

i wont be back wors 100 meal i have had in vega and trust me i have had a lot we have better servic at the yard hous heck the pink hotdog place is probabl a better choic becaus at least their staff has some pride  if you must eat here at least make sure you dont get a short girl with a brown ponytail michell  as your server 

check total 13080
check  9143471im sorri for not be abl to give a full review of this place but it was bad  real bad

ther were four of us in our parti and after reject the first seat that was full of worn off red duct tape  we were sat down by a pleasant enough person and order 3 diet coke and a corona one person from the parti had to use the restroom and when she return  it was about over with for food i want to check thing out myself becaus i know that the cleanli of a restroom can reveal signific defici for the entir restaur i couldnt even get to the bathroom  when i open the door to where the restroom were  i had to immedi turn around the smell of urin was so strong there was no chang we were go to stay and eat

i couldnt believ the sign in the front door mention yelp and i couldnt believ the rate of this place we paid 1121 for our three coke and a beer and left for true food 

i have to give this place a one star becaus i cannot go lower but this was the absolut worst place i have ever been too and hope i dont find one worsmy wife and i spent near 300 and were extrem disappoint with the food and the experi i cant think of a time in a suppos highend restaur when i just wasnt abl to finish each cours primarili due to the bland and unorigin  of the food 

1 the open was a cevich that featur a tough metal flavor scallop that made both of us wonder if we were go to end up in the er we are huge cevich fan   

2 the sausag entré was so forgett that i actual forgot to eat most of the links

3  the small meatbal with gnocchi from a tast perspect rival some of the frozen select from trader joe averag and forgettable

4 both dessert were chocol and were good but noth special

5 we notic that the hostess kept seat custom includ ourselv in the back room near the bathroom which smell terribl and look as though it was in need of a clean the maîtr d left most of the tabl in the best part of the restaur empti for the major of the night no comprendo

6 our server was friend but seem disinterest and on two occas plate were slap down on our tabl with no verbal descript where is the passion and interest this is part of the tast menu experi 

7 time of the food and wine flight was off with the except of the justin port the wine select was averag and not a good value

mi wife couldnt stop talk about how poor the food was the entir ride home not a great way to celebr our valentin day

bottom line  this is our second time at quiesscenc and definit the last time what an utter disappointas you can tell from my profil im not one to write a bad review  if you dont have someth nice to saybut i cant stop myself from share my experi at quiessenc  especi when consid the price

on our anniversari i thought it would be great to take her to a highend spot like quiessenc  i look at the review first time social media has let me down it look legit and i set it up without tell her  i made a reserv let them know it was our anniversari ask for a nice tabl and offer to pay a littl more if there was someth special they could do  for our near 300 here what special means

 a tabl by the door i serious cant believ they cram a tabl there everyon who walk in was basic on our lap
 after take our drink order it took 20 minut befor our waiter return and with just one of the drinks
 we order receiv our appet in ok time and then wait anoth 40 minut until our meal began come out we order special cours  big mistake
 each dish came out somewher between warm to cold for sure sit around
  even if warm the qualiti was not anywher near the calib of what a similar price meal at ani other highend establish around town would be
 tip was includ in the bill at over 18

serious unreal when express our disappoint we receiv a sorri  even if it was an off night there just too much here to ignor save your money and go somewher elsmy husband and i have been here befor and love the food one star warrant becaus 

1 the line is ridicul even with 4 peopl in front of you be prepar to wait over an hour 
2 no one under 21 can eat here wtf okay what like what

thi trip my husband 13 year old daughter and i came all the way off strip for this place wait in line for about 40 minut which hadnt move in the 40 minut we were stand there when someon came and told us wed have to leav becaus you have to be 21 to eat there yes you read that correct 

never go back with or without my kid everone word could describ this whole place  why

whi did the owner decid to open a restaurant
whi did the chef decid hesh knew anyth about cooking
whi is the silverton the onli casino in town who is get no applic for it open posit ok well that one a no brainer

it took onli one bite although i am often a fool and will continu to eat more despit what my tast bud are scream at me

mi meal was simpl  chicken tortilla soup  how can you mess that up

wel let me tell you mi casa mess it up with flare and extravagance

aft tax the socal bowl of socal soup was the better part of 900 but it was far from a bowl and it onli resembl to soup was the way it drip off my spoon oh and a bowl is a bowl  not a cup

her a bit of advic for the chef  chicken tortilla soup is not a beef broth base and certain not a broth made from beef bouillon cubes

th soup was so harsh let me emphas harsh here it almost made both me and my dinner companion gag with disgustaw i had to give myself a few day of cool down to write this review otherwis i think i may have drop a lot of f bomb so unclassi just like this place if i could give this place zero star i would
mi friend and i wonder here this past weekend in the hope of get some decent margarita we were so wrong we were seat by a girl who didnt seem to like her job pretti bland it was whatev we look over our menus and the margarita look pretti good so we order one each at 7 dollar a glass i ask for a not so sweet and sour one but a stronger one with more flavor so the waitress recommend one to me while she put that order in my friend and i decid to share some basic beef taquito for 8 dollar she drop off some free chip and salsa which were noth too impress the 3 choic of salsa all tast the same pretti much and were bland so sad our drink came over and i took one sip and alreadi felt sick from all the sweet and sour it tast like a virgin drink im sorryim 27dont you rememb check my id while i ask for someth of the opposit i did not say bring me a virgin margarita open your ear my friend was not impress either with his frozen margarita which tast like frozen lemon water ugh what is this place our taquito came over and they look like they were from the freezer isl at target believ me when i say there was no beef whatsoev in this littl thing there were 3 of them and they were the size of my boney littl pinki finger 8 dollar for what omg unimpress when the waitress came over to ask how our drink were i told her mine was too sweet and i didnt like it as i move it to the side for her to take away after one sip obvious she didnt get the hint as she watch me and walk away umm alright she brought our check over and i notic our drink were 8 dollar while on the menu they were 7 dollar so i decid to ask her about this she said they charg an extra dollar for the alcohol nowher on that menu did it say they were go to charg more money for a drink that alreadi has alcohol in it wtf yesi understand it is onli an extra dollar per drink but it is the point of tell your custom about this befor they order i didnt even drink my margarita becaus it was disgust and want you to take it away but instead you decid you want to charg me more for it not to mention your food suck and was such a disappoint i left this place so angri and upset over this the waitress offer no help and it was obvious she want us out of there
im appar still veri angri over this about half a week later i will make sure none of my friend and famili ever go to this place i realli hope they do not stay around too long and are replac by someth better i am so let down with mi casa food and servicfail for the travelzoo deal  paid 99 for the voucher which was to includ full dinner for 2  what they fail to mention was the restaur would make you pay tax  20 gratuiti on the retail price of the offer 320  so this 99 grouponesqu deal actual end up cost 200  oh and the food suckhi
for my anniversari with my boyfriend my brother in law bought us a travelzoo type dinner which we use here the food was good howev we were unabl to eat most of it becaus each cours was serv within 10 minut of each other and the waiter took our first cours out of the way befor we were done with it fine no big deal we start with the second cours and yet again the main cours was serv i told them to leav the food and not take it as we were still work it felt like we were rush the entir time at one point one of our server tri to take a plate of food away as my boyfriend was eat it what realli so eventu all our food was gone and we were left with some tini dessert and a 35 tip requir that was not expect oh and at one point they drop a bag of to go food on our tabl this confus me becaus 1 we didnt ask for it and 2 the food they did take away from us they stack on top of each other so if it had been our food that is disgust and dirti it turn out to be anoth tabl sloppi salami and pizza that was deliv to us gross we tri tell the manag polit that the servic was aw and that realist tip the requir amount was absurd sinc we werent have a great time she didnt do anyth about it and instead threaten to send in secur for what let her know that her manag was not up to par for such a high scale and expens restaur i left confus and angri and felt cheat if they had left us alon the whole time and mayb listen when there was confus i would have given 5 star i am realli disappoint palmit pain me to do this but after recent experi i feel it necessari to comment on the roosevelt  i would have previous consid myself a loyal patron of the roosevelt but after tonight i am done for good  let me prefac this stori by say that i arriv last night a thursday just befor a brutal storm hit  a bunch of us were liter trap in the roosevelt as the storm went on outsid  the air condit cut off  but eventu the storm subsid and the power came back on  at that point i was somewhat happi that i was no longer trap in a small sweati hous so i grab a refil and start talk to my friend  as i was talk i felt a tap on my shoulder and i turn around to hear the owner tell me to be quiet we cant hear the music refer to the exceed mediocr folk rock act that had start perform in the front area  now i love live music and i have no problem with give the perform an appropri place to play but after sit through a storm for an hour and stick around for some drink i would expect to actual be allow to speak  unfortun matt clear doesnt know a thing about good busi or about treat his custom well  ive been come into his bar for a year and a half and the guy has never onc had the courtesi to say hello to me  all ive ever gotten from him is a be quiet   a guy who doesnt recogn his good custom doesnt deserv to have them at all and unfortun for matt he wont have this one anymorhad 1 drink here onc last fall with my busi partner after a meet downtown  it look cool from the outsid and she had been there befor and like it  i did not  the concept is cool  i love old hous and repurpos edific and was stoke to tri it  

we walk in and it was kinda dead  there was 1 group of 4 peopl in the front room chat and i felt like we walk into their live room and interrupt a privat convers when we enter  

the bartend saw us walk in and walk out thru the back  we saddl up to the bar when she return she didnt greet us or even acknowledg us and then proced to throw atttitud when i ask what beer they had  she couldnt recommend anyth  she pour a crappi beer for me just dump it into the glass  my 3yo niec could give a better pour and a weak drink for my partner and walk away again

 the servic blew the whole experi blew  not again my friendway to go essenc 

after a few aw experi here youd think we would learn right rememb how i said i would never go back to eat here ever again well this morn i did and i regret it

long stori short we stood in line order paid 30 for two breakfast item and two ice soy latt found a tabl and wait and wait and wait and wait as soon as i notic a tabl of four who had come in signific later than us be deliv food and enjoy their meal i was furious our drink were gone and we had been sit there for almost 40 minut 

mi boyfriend went to the counter to ask them what was go on they didnt have our order surpris i shouldnt have been essenc and i just werent meant to be it get better  we ask for the food to go sinc we live 2 minut away and we were sick of sit there they brought out the food super fast which was a littl concern sinc our food hadnt been made yet right 

they were kind enough to load us up with some goodi but it didnt even matter becaus after our super short drive home we immedi open our food from be super hungri and it was cold holi shit give me a breaki cant rate the food  the peopl at the counter were so rude to me that i decid to leav befor order  

is this part of the essenc of this placemy offic is now with in walk distanc but we have been go here sinc it was dee we be a coupl of guy and i so today bruce said let go to lunch i say ok he then say i know anywher except 5th ave the boy know me so well  i tell him no i will go today it has been a while sinc i have given in and gone with the mass i just do not like the place so we walk over and are greet by a bubbl waitress this place alway has nice wait peopl she talk with us for a few minut and then take our order 
oh the food the food i order a french dip with cole slaw and a side of onion ring bruce has his usual a blt with well done bacon and fries
now mind you we are the onli folk order at the time and still it take an unusu amount of time to get the food which by the way would have been better if we had never gotten our food what i get is roast beef cut thick and with the grain now anyon who like a french dip know the meat should be suppl and slice thin pile nice on the bun it should also have a rich beef flavour as should the au jus i mean even the lowli of the low line cook should know one slice meat against the grain alway the bun on which it sat was just that a meat seat i also love cole slaw and usual will eat what is serv not this total lack ani inspir result in no flavour the ring look good but look can be deceiving
so bruce you are right ani place but 5th avemehhhhhhhh is all i have to say about this place

im here on a saturday brunch time and the place is kinda full but the food i can say 95 of the food was bad and the other 5 was decent my good i even went for food that i normal dont eat in hope that they would tast a littl better than the rest nope bad decision

i tri to give them anoth chanc and went for the dessert section i am a major dessert person and there is no way that you can mess up cooki yup they did never step foot into here again even if it was a comp mealthis scenario seem familiar to mostdinn for a friend birthdaypick somewher nice with a wide varieti of food option that most in the parti have not eaten at befor  the celebr decid on rao in caesar  i had forgotten until i walk up to the restaur that i had actual eaten there twice befor  after this experi i rememb whi i didnt rememb them the first two time  

our night began with a phone call to the restaur to find out the dress codeattir  we were told that it was busi casual and that jean were not permit  we ask even for women if they were nice jean and were told we would be turn away  upon arriv at the restaur the first guest i saw seat was wear a hawaiian print button up shirt tan short and flip flop  next i saw a women in a tank top white short and tenni shoe  i had chang out of my outfit to meet their requir make us 20 minut late onli to find out when we got there that we still would have been better dress then some of the patrons

w were seat in a far corner in the back of the restaur  greet prompt with menus and a discuss of the special  the rest of my parti was a bit putoff when we were told that the poach salmon was actual serv in a foilbag  we order drink and review the menu  i explain what i had eaten befor and what i thought might be good select  be that i had been there befor i decid to tri someth new  their vodka sauc is truli amaz and they had a ricotta shell dish that came with their famous marinara sauc so i decid to switch it out with the vodka sauc  the rest of the parti gave their order 
our waiter then becam nonexist and seem rush or busi whenev he did final come over to check on us   food came out after a long wait the restaur wasnt even busymin look like a glorifi version of mac and chees made with pasta shell and a vodka sauc  i was veri disappoint that there wasnt ani ricotta in the shell  when i inquir about it with the waiter he told me i had order it that way  i knew i had specif ask for ricotta so he offer to bring me a side of ricotta   the rest of the parti was not satisfi with their meal either  the waiter never ask what we thought about our meal  when we final got our check we about pass out  the drink we had been order red bull and hous vodka were 22 each  these were tini littl cocktail that are serv in the same size glass that you get compd drink in while gambl in a  casino  they charg separ for the red bull and vodka which most place do but charg us for a full red bull with each drink with out bring out the remain red bull to the tabl as most place do  we were appal  dinner was over 250 per coupl the food was below averag and the servic was horribl  we even told him we were there for our friend birthday and he look at us like so  
i can pretti much guarante i will never eat at rao again  i am more than will to pay decent price for excel food and servic but for what we receiv at rao i would have rather gone to the oliv garden and save 200  at least there i can get unlimit salad and breadstick  lol
i am not a glutton for punishmentthi girl will never make the mistak of go to rao for a nice night out with friend ever againi have been to layer in their old locat and found them to be just ok  the bake good were good but i found the owner to be pretenti and distant  i havent tri ani of their new menu item so i realli cant comment on their expand menu  i have to say even if the offer were the best i had ever tast i would struggl to continu to give them my busi  

first of all i must admit i was complet turn off by the femal owner when i encount her at an auto repair shop on boulder hwi short befor their new locat open  she announc to the wait room that she was go to use this space as her offic and then proceed to subject me to her phone call for over an hour

if that werent enough i am thorough disturb by their repli to some of the less than glow review on here  reinforc their reput for be pretenti and now even rude given their respons to christoph b

product is a larg part of a busi obvious but so is servic  how you conduct yourself in person or onlin also reflect upon your businot great

in fact i cant understand  the glow review of this locat  perhap as the owner so charm post in a previous review i just dont get it  i thought that the rather charm experi i had at layer was simpli the result of the owner or employe have a bad day but now i can see it is just part of the cultur of this compani 

i came to this locat with my child who is rather rambuncti i can attestbut who was treat a bit more like he had some kind of airborn diseas  a look at their websit will show you the kind of attitud that they seem to have toward the famili orient custom  

what the charm in a place that treat it custom poor  i cannot believ that you suggest that a custom bring back their child cake so that you could tell them what was wrong with itor more accur i imagin that you would tell them what was wrong with them  

not friend not spectacular food and horribl custom servic skillnever said i went on 82 just post my review that day  
ye they did tri to follow up after i post my opinion but if you have a low qualiti product as it is then im not sure how one can make it up to the custom coupon a discount i clear dont plan to return layer bakeri rude repli to mine and other honest review of their product complet valid the dozen review that complain about their poor custom servic and terribl employe attitud 
well glad i could rate you guy again tootlattempt to take some friend for a special birthday lunch on saturday  some suit stop us as we enter and ask if we were part of the special parti  no i repli wed like to enjoy lunch  ala thing took a serious downtown from there  suit guy said we are onli open for lunch on saturday for special event i suggest that suit note that on the websit or yelp but he said all the inform is alreadi there in plain view  sure i must need to get my eye examin as this is what yelp claims

ther is no mention of hour on the httpwwwvglasvegascom websit unless they ad them late yesterday

on the ocass ive eaten here the food has been glorious and the servic subpar at best  save your special night out for someplac els  final i predict this fine establish go the way of rosemari  especi with the suit attitudso here are the fact keep in mind my reserv was set a week in advanc for my 1 year anniversari it took 30 minut to mere get sat 30 more minut to get my first cocktail and starter and then anoth 45 minut after that to get my entre all the while the larg group of 5 or more are get sat instant serv in minut and cater to we were ignor and put on the back burner becaus there were onli 2 of us and are a younger coupl 
  im tire of go to a restaur held in high regard and when we get treat like crap we get to hear excus like well your tabl is save the group befor you is just hang out though and we are doubl book tonight snobbi hostess that need a reprimand for her terribl peopl skill and attitud or im sorri that everyth is take so long we are just back up and im not too sure whi waiter tri hard to cover up for manag neglect their patron this is an acclaim restaur but cant keep on top of their shit on a saturday in decemb is that a joke
  my experi was complet unaccept and i will never ever suggest anyon to go here simpli base on principl 
  thank for ruin my anniversariwell i alway like to go for lunch at vintner grill  and up until now i havent had ani complaint in the year we have been go there  today my lunch arriv with a side of cole slaw that look and tast like it had been made at least 4 or 5 day ago  i mention  this to the waiter who said he would tell the chef   well the waiter went in and out of the kitchen at least four time until we were finish with the rest of our meal  when he took our entre plate away i ask him what the chef had said  he said that the chef had told him they had use the cole slaw that they  had left  

i was never offer a differ side dish and needless to say there was no accommod on the bill   i am realli disappoint in the kitchen for serv this terribl  and i hope not taint side dish  i am also disappoint in the manag for not train their wait staff to be better at handl problems

if you cant trust the foodi see no reason for go backthis use to be my favorit restaur  now it perman off the list
th calamari was rubberi undercook and the bread was come off  like the oil wasnt hot enough  my steak sandwich was veri rawdisgust  i had to send it back and i dont like send thing back  it ruin my appetit  my friend order their chocol cakelik desert first item on the desert menu and it had a long black hair in it  the waiter correct didnt charg us for it  in addit the wait staff seem understaf as our waiter was liter run around the restaur and had littl time to give us attent  long period of time went by where we wonder if he was on a break or something
im veri disappoint as this use to be someplac that i held abov other restaur  i was veri wrong  ill never be back  save yourself the disappoint and tri someplac newpeopl think i love give bad review when in all actual i root to give good review becaus when in an establish i look forward to have a good time i just i gave this establish a 1 for the follow reason  let make this in bullet point form

1  after we sat down we got our menus 10 min after and it wasnt busy

2  food take a while to prepar  mayb my hunger just made my impati stronger becaus it seem like forev befor we receiv our order  but that probabl normal

3  decor was minim there wasnt much thought into make the restaur look appeal and welcoming

4  last the owner doesnt seem to care about custom servic or whether peopl will want to come back or be given a bad verbal review becaus when we present our coupon for the meal
a the server didnt know how to use it or what it was which onli mean the owner doesnt communic thing like that to his employees
b when she call the owner to find out how to use it he wouldnt pick up the phone  she dial almost 7 time it took my cousin to use his phone a differ number for the owner to pick up  obvious employe call arent import but unknown number are
c he subscrib to the coupon my cousin paid for the coupon and the owner wouldnt accept it  the coupon was purchas for 15 and worth 30  our bill came to 31 and some chang  we end up have to pay becaus the owner wouldnt accept the coupon he obvious agre to 

the onli reason whi im even bother to give a star is becaus the food was realli good  the cook was great in prepar our dish and for the server who was help and sweet and patient with us 

moral of the stori as great littl busi are one of so mani sometim forget that custom will talk to other peopl or blast a review in yelp about the awesom or aw experi we have in establishi realli want to enjoy myself at merkato ethiopian cafe  ive never had ethipian food and my companion had onli enjoy onc so we decid to go to the highest rate place in vega that was the cheapest  merkato seem to be a great choice

w have been do 30 day of vegetarian so we decid on the pastri with lentil as an appet and the vegetarian combo that most peopl on yelp rave about 

i found it a bit strang when the vegetarian combo came out without the pastrieslentil  but figur that they would bring it out later or forgot to get it she spoon a red chiliconsist food onto the spongebread plate that was the vegetarian combo at this point i had finish my water befor begin to eat 

everyth tast good the injera spongey bread went well with everyth but i found that it might have tast better if it was warm instead of cold not a beef with the restaur my companion took a bite and pull someth out of her mouth this is where thing took a turn for the worse

sh show me a small black rock that was in the yellow food that look like mash corn i thought it might be a seed and she drop it on her plate  make a loud chink sound i felt it and we definit agre it was a rock a rock in our food realli 

a waitress never adress if we were do okay but to be fair they were busi chat with each other alon at the bar instead of help their custom my water was empti the whole dinner and was never refil i had to walk to the waitress and ask them for the check 

this is when the second strike happened

th check read a vegetarian platter and then an 8 appet that we did not order instead of give us the pastri they had given us a more expens appet that they had scoop on to the plate howev there was no way we could have known this dure dinner becaus 1 noth was ever explain to us what each thing was and 2 they appet appar came at the same time as the vegetarian platter and the descript of the vegetarian platter is vagu on the menu 

i ask if they could take some of the cost off of the appet  i acknowledg  that mayb there could have been more communic but it realli was a mistak on the waitress part for take down our order wrong she said oh no becaus that good stuff and your take it togo to which i respond i dont want to wast your food if you want to throw it away and take some of the charg off im okay with that she said she couldnt do anyth and was complet unrecept and unapologet her view was that we should have told the waiter that we had receiv the wrong appet 

mi companion told her and show the the black rock that was found in the food no emot no apolog she just said oh are you kid me we were astound by how terribl the servic was

poor communic take two parti but they realli drop the ball on this one
poor wait servic becaus i had to get up to ask for the check and no one came to check on us  they werent busi with anyth els but convers with each other
poor kitchen  there was a rock in the food a rock

im veri upset im veri sad that im write a poor review befor this my companion alway joke that i alway have a great time and enjoy all dine experi that streak is over thank a lot merkato avoid this place at all cost just in principl of the way they treat their customers

restaur that care more about money than share an experi with their custom dont deserv to be open  there are too mani passion and love busi ownerswork that are struggl to support an oper like merkatoonli been here onc and onc was enough the place is absolut crap not that i typic care about decor but it was dingi as hell insid  in fact your bog standard denni is like a taj mahal by comparison

a other have comment there was some ethnic fairskin girl on duti when we went i know she was ukrainian becaus the coupl behind us pick up on the accent which was almost too thick to understand and ask her not exact authent but then again that someth els im not typic concern with

what i am concern with howev is food qualiti  in particular place that skimp on stuff i got a saag dish  cant rememb what it was probabl beef or aloo  and it was complet drown in the saag pure spinach wife got the butter chicken same thing  80 sauc 20 meat and the tast was just aight noth special at all which made it even more annoy i could have cook the same thing at home for a tenth the price

dur the cours of the meal i notic someth which look like a black beetl with it innard spill out ive seen plenti of cardamom seed in my time but the one im use to are khakiishgreenish in colour and a lot smaller than this was i call ms ukrain over and ask her what it was she  get this  gave me a scare express and said in her halt english i not know dont eat it then scurri off dont eat it i had a sniff of the seed and it was definit a cardamom  evid a giant black north american cardamom frank look at the place i wouldnt have been surpris if it was a beetle

nev go back i wouldnt have even if the server hadnt have advis me not to eat the food best indian on the west side remain tandoori time ii on ne cnr 57th and w bell and even that a far cri from what ive had in sydney and san fran i second mr ks observ  avoid this placei give everyon a fair chanc and i am a foodi and wine lover but i put the vig on blast i have frequent this barrestaur in the past mere for their atmospher pretti sceneri and great patio howev more than a few time the servic has been downright unprofession and staff rude from time to time 

i was recent in the restaur with a fair larg parti and we all end up with food poison from the hummus and baba ganoush i wasnt so upset that it happen becaus it a risk one take but what happen after i will never forget after nice call the manag pam i onli want to inform her of what had happen so that other would not get sick and she quick becam defens and told me that it was imposs we could get sick on hummus sad but true in my opinion she must have never taken a food safeti class as most of us know bacteria can grow in protein and hummus is all protein she argu me and i quick respond with the fact that eight peopl get sick is no coincid as a manag in the past it right to sympath with the custom not defend i want noth from her but she quick told me she would tell the chef and sorri hope you feel better and she hung up the phone this tell me the vig manag is not onli unprofession but downright aw 

i never thought their food was that great anyway and it a step up from bar food but if you want drink menus toss at your tabl long wait befor be greet rude staff and food poison then check out the vig if you dont want to park in valet be care park in the check cash park lot becaus it can be danger cross that busi streetif you enjoy eat at pretenti overpr lacklust steakhous then n9ne is perfect for you  if your a sensibl person who enjoy good food and get valu for money stay away from n9ne

th appet were bore and unorigin compar in qualiti to most sport bar or your averag applebe  the steak was well overcook and i find it hard to believ that even if it were cook proper it wouldnt be ani better from a filet you can buy from ani groceri store and cook yourself i should note here that i had their signatur world famous filet  or whatev selfindulg taglin they were use to describ it that particular night  

the decor of this place must be fund by the massengil compani becaus it reek of douch  there is a big differ between tri to be modern trendi and chiqu and tri too hard and fall on your face  mayb if they focus more energi on the food versus trendi mood light this review would be differ  the onli good thing that came out of my visit to n9ne was our waiter i onli hope that hes taken his talent to a restaur worthi of him

thi is the worst meal ive ever had at ani fine dine restaur in las vega periodi have no idea where to start my boyfriend and i ate here on saturday night we were stay at the palm check in late it had been a long day  we decid sinc it was so  late we would ask the front desk at checkin how they felt about nine steakhous and nove italiano most seem a littl more pump on nine so we decid to give it a tri i realli want to like this place base on the feedback we receiv at checkin but unfortun i was utter disappointed

for starter we had the oyster on the half shell which was ok the garnish were a spici cocktail sauc and some sort of wine sauc that you drizzl on the oyster pretti good

our waiter was somewhat pushi we had just receiv our glass of champagn to go with our oyster and he was readi to take our wine order and food order let us enjoy one thing at a time can we savor the moment pleas sinc it would all go downhil after this 

we place our order  organ fire chicken for myself and my boyfriend had the 18oz prime bonein ribey 35 day dri age

onc again like in year past the worker were have some kind of alterc with each other when i got there after midnight 

like usual the host ladi had her back turn and pretend she couldnt see us wait she and the other host ladi have been do this for over 2 year this time i ask the server whi that ladi alway ignor us he actual explain that she doe in fact ignor guest intent and that she is just a veri jade and angri worker 

im one of those guy who write detail assess of food for exampl i might say the qualiti and attent the chef put into perfect the filet to a juici mediumrar was impress and well repres the integr of this restaur but realli the onli thing i can say about grand cafe is that the food tast like shit

if it not bad enough that the clientel here are usual extrem drunk and shout disgust and stupid thing the food take about 3040 minut to come out so you have to sit there the whole time and endur that shit and most the time the custom leav after about 20 minut i recommend not come here anymor even if you are at santa fe station read my review of the fatburg here at santa fei would still rather endur the servic over there than eat at grand cafe there are so mani local 24 hour game bar around town that serv except food and have great servic and low price just go there insteadi love go out one definit of an extrovert that i heard recent is that your batteri are recharg by be around other peopl you dont need alon time that pretti much me the idea that i just need to chill out and be by myself is a total foreign concept but ive heard enough peopl talk about it that it must be real 

so that said you would think i would love this place it offer the most jackrass scottsdal has to offer per squar foot last time i was there which was veri recent i play some crazi human tetri to get back to the bar to pay my tab i bump into 84 pair of fake boob which is not realli a complaint 500 ass of which onli 321 were women and i pretti much was sweat like a seagul on fire on the 4th of juli which ruin my perfect coif and excess huge hair i paid 20 to get in i said twenti fuck dollar you should have seen the look on the face of the moneytak appar she thought it was total reason 50 for 5 drink i didnt cuss at the bartend 

now it not all bad the burlesqu dancer ass are sublim a true delight coconut creme pie for my eye some super hot girl kept stare me down i would have talk to her if not for the music that requir scream over and the fact that it would have taken me 20 minut to get to her and she probabl would have been gone and the women i was there with probabl would not have appreci it and the music wasnt bad 

that said do your wallet your sens your sens of space your intellig and your friend a favor and go somewher elswellwher can i startmi love wife and i
 went here for some more amaz sushi when our knee were cut out from beneath us as we walk in sigh

w were present with new lunch menus that were veri disappointingso my wife and i be addict to ahi poke salad decid that we would just pay dinner price so we could just get 1 each which is the restaur polici but we alreadi knew about it

so no big dealthen they kill us by say that even though you are pay for 2 all you can eat you can onli get 1 ahi poke salad per tablemi wife and i know this to be fals ask the sushi chef on duti and he also said that 1 ahi poke per table

w outrag by such senseless nonsens leftth waitress had one of the worst attitud ive ever experienc my wife left them youv been yelp card and the waitress threw them out the door at herveri unprofessionala veri sad experi sinc we love sushi and they are closethis place was horribl the custom servic was below averag we order ayc and the waitress was tell the tabl not to order to much at a time caus it would take 2030 minut to get our food but yet she said we onli have an hour to eat how can you offer ayc and then limit the amount off food 

later in the even we ask where the rest of our order are and the sushi chef decid to start lie and yell say that we never order anymor onli to come back a few minut later mind you after they gave us dessert and said he found the slip with our order but this was too late 

worst part of the whole thing is that i come to find out the next day that my friend got sick with what was most like food poison this was a major wast of money and i regret give it a trisiu wok has been a favorit for quit some time  sad today experi knock them off the list

mi cowork and i decid we need a tasti meal today so we place a deliveri order through siu wok  we were happi when the meal arriv much sooner than the 45minut deliveri estim  our food was hot and smell delici  we were all enjoy our food when one cowork made a stomachturn discoveri a dead fli in her food  we all immedi stop eat repuls by the larg fli nestl up to a slice carrot

i immedi call siu wok to complain and spoke with jennif  i told her what happen and ask for a refund on the entir order  she said she could refund the contamin meal but would have to speak with the manag for author on the other two  she call back a few minut later and said she was onli given permiss to refund the 795 for the extraprotein meal  she seem to understand whi i was disappoint but said her hand were tie  i ask her to relay to manag that i was veri disappoint in his lack of attent to the matter and that siu wok had just lost a consider amount of busi as our offic frequent place order there

instead of siu wok be out 2344 they have lost an offic full of custom and gain a negat yelp review  doesnt the fli look deliciour server was a horribl lie bitch to put it nice  caus i want to like this place i realli did  she didnt greet us at all the first thing she said was what do you wanna drink with a bit of an attitud  she wouldnt serv us bread until we ask for it sinc we saw other tabl with basket of bread but she straight up told us bread was for the peopl who order from the lunch menu  then she brought out a measli basket of bread for us and said that was all was left  even though all the other tabl had big ass basket full of all kind of differ bread

when she took our order she didnt ask my father how well he want his steak  which we didnt realiz until his steak came and it was all bloodi on the insid  i order a strawberri raspberri and blueberri waffl which was actual surpris realli good  i think that was the best part dure the meal

sh took 20 minut in get our bill and finish the transact  we didnt even know what the hell she was do  she kept circl the restaur go in and out of the kitchen look around go back into the kitchen and come out with noth  it was realli sad too caus the other server who was take care of tabl nearbi us was so attent and she just fail upon comparison  i dont rememb what els sinc this happen last month but just no  never again  go spend your money elsewhere

p i just rememb an incid that happen to the tabl next to us who were also be serv by this lazi ass waitress  appar one of the ladi want white bread and the waitress gave her sourdough  the ladi told her it was sourdough and instead of just apolog and bring her the white bread the waitress argu with her and insist it wasnt sourdough  all the ladi said was uh this is sourdough  trust me i ate it

that parti of 4 also didnt finish the major of their food so im assum what they order wasnt that tasti  they also onli left a 2 tip which was hilari sinc you know meal like this are pretti expens in vega  and they total didnt follow the 15 tip rule  and neither did we

i wish i rememb the server name so you can do all you can do to avoid her but sad i dont   all i rememb is shes i think hispan middleag short kind of on the larg side with cur brown hair  im sure a lot of peopl have had great experi at the cafe consid the review befor mine  and the food was pretti good too  but they just realli need to get rid of herno no no

th friday through sunday buffet here is advertis as 999 on the websit but when you go to pay after you ate it 1295 per person  i complain to the owner to  ask her to fix the websit  she just gave me a bunch of doubletalk  can you imagine

absolut not ok     oi couldnt wait for this filipino nation chain to open up back in 2007  i was there on open week at threemonth mark and then anoth three month later  all visit were met with horribl servic and mediocr food most of which tast can  if you feel like you must visit and eat here then tri the lechon  it the dish the chain is famous for back home  it the one item offer i cannot complain about

custom servic is horribl you may start with one server and end up with anoth  youll be lucki if either know what the dish theyr serv are none i stop to ask could visual identifi what the food they were bring to the tabl were call much less what ingredi theyr compris of and these are server that have been there for month mayb even a few year sinc i havent been in for a veri long time  the first week was understand but the same lousi servic extend to you after three month  after six month  

on my last visit i specif state i was in the mood for fresh seafood and ask the server who was the brotherinlaw of the manag for some suggest  upon hear that i like mussel he suggest i tri the mussel dish  when i complain of the tast of the dish the manag disclos to me that the mussel were from a can  what the   he then tri to appeas me by say that dessert would be on the hous  

i was kept wait for anoth 15 minut or so while they track down my server sinc he appar left the properti  know what i know now i could wager a bet on where he went but then i would be disclos where i work and id rather not  he was final call back in and i tri the ube halaya dessert which i now wish i did not wast 30 minut of my life wait for  to top it off the bill arriv with the charg includ the disgrac entre and dessert  tsk tsk  the shame was all on me for come back the third time

do yourselv a huge favor and do not eat here  these proprietor use to do busi in california  do some legwork and see whi they left that state and set up shop here  what a disgrac to the barrio fiesta reput built back home 

actual barrio fiesta has franchis so wide in the philippin that it no longer has the great reput it onc did 20 or so year ago  i think that kamayan is a morehonor chain i had the opportun to dine at a makati locat in 99 and the food was fantastunbeliev  we should have stuck to our gut instinct and said no to tri out anoth dim sum place other than our usual orchid garden  we should have also read all of the yelp review on this place befor enter their restaur  what a mistak we made  never befor have i ask my famili to ditch a restaur the moment we got seateduntil this day

walk in my famili didnt get greet by the host upfront with his head buri in a newspap  no  instead it felt as though we had disturb him  it took him a while to muster up a how mani befor he remov himself from his seat to sit us at a tabl  strike one

next we ask our server if they had dim sum  to which she rude repli dim sum no order see we had their menu befor us  okayyyi  understand we werent go to order dim sum from their menu as we are accustom to order from cart  she walk away and return with a paper menu of dim sum item and a pencil and drop them at our tabl no explan  weird so i assum we do have to order as we see no cart in sight anyway  strike two

w final get to write down our list of dim sum item we would like  we then proceed to ask her for two more set for our tabl of four we were seat on a tabl set for two  without a word she turn around and grab two set from an open tabl  as she began to place them on our tabl she push past my two young children reach over them result in her thrust the fork and knife toward my husband as he was write  realli woman  she basic poke his hand with a fork tine never excus herself for it and simpli walk away  rude  strike three

at that point i ask my husband if we could leav  so upset  as i walk past the server who then realiz we were walk out i point at her and scold her with a you need to be nicer  then we left

now i apolog in advanc if i offend i have no intent of it  but serious  at some chines restaur you are common accustom to experi a kind of abrupt hurri kind of servic that is typic of their customari practic  i should know  im chines myself  so im not be over sensit of the situat at harbor palac that night  i know what to typic expect or not expect

but this  the custom servic at harbor palac should not be experienc by ani pay patron no matter what  i should say the lack of custom servic  they have no common sens of decenc when it come to work with peopl  in fact i believ that becaus they are fed their busi via tour buse dont ask me how or whi it is that way they feel the need to not offer good if ani custom servic  we are never return to this place again  they are disgusti dislik this place and will never recommend it to anyon fine dine to me involv 1 uniqu wonder food 2 immacul servic  this is whi you pay so much more which is whi it call fine dining

if you look i usual like to onli review place i like so peopl will go there whi wast time to help advertis place i do not like this is an exception

her is the gist my friend had left becaus she was hung over she had order bread from the cart prior to leav i did not so she got her food in a box and left while myself and 4 other friend stay for the rest of the dinner while we were enjoy our entre i was eat her bread the bread was wheat bread and i admit was delici so the waiter whom french accent sound super unauthent see that she left come over to clean up and remov her place set  which is normal he reach over and grab the plate with the bread on it which was next to me i tell him no no leav the bread i am eat it now what is the common sens  thing to do if you were the waiter

think about it common sense

answ you put the plate down walk away and let the custom enjoy the bread 

right

you do not even need to say anyth but of cours instead of do this he spoke back in condescend tone but monsieur that is the ladi bread as if i broke some sort of natur law is it realli unaccept for me to eat someon els breadif the same situat occur at ani other restaur i can almost guarante you they will put the plate down and would probabl even be glad to do so 

so he grab the plate with my hand on the plate as well and said i will bring you anoth bread i total recal think whi is he argu with me so he take off with the plate and this was when i was not too happi he did come back with bread but it was not the same type obvious i am not go to make call him out becaus it is not the same kind of bread but this ad to my fury

alright becaus this happen with bread you may say it onli bread well let substitut this situat with say soup your friend leav so you are enjoy their clam chowder which was order the waiter come over to deni you of it even though you ask to leav it there he bring you a new bowl of soup howev when it arriv it some cream of broccoli 

i know most of you would say someth about the soup

anyway the food i order the kobe beef i had six ounc of it it sold by the ounc it was not good the abov incid occur dure the main cours so i stop eat left a coupl ounc on the plate and did not allow anyon to touch it 

anoth one of my friend saw i was upset and so she said someth to the manag or owner not sure and he provid complementari glass of wine to everyon i made sure nobodi drank the wine they gave me 
i do not need this crap and you do not either hundr of place in vega to have a great dine experi i walk out upset 

it mayb a funni stori with my friend and i now but at the moment i was pissssssed


nev again


breakdown 1star for the manger who did someth 0 star of everyth elsthis restaur is not like the other

guy savoy in pari is an experi  unfortun guy savoy in las vega is just a meal and an expens one to boot

th ungraci experi begin as you walk through the door and are bark at by the host and hostess who do not have the courtesi to allow guest to fulli enter the door befor immedi question you about reserv  the gate guard may not let you through without them 

the entri is invit as is the bar and loung where a love fireplac glow  unfortun the dine room is sever and leav much to be desir the environ is not onli cold but is also quit stark with the feel of a dingi new york loft apart on a gloomi day  the high ceil give the room a cavern mine shaft effect and the restaur has no music whatsoev  

the lack of ambianc and music leav noth but the waiter and food as your stage for enjoy  unfortun the stress of the servic afflict and burden the staff which in turn creat a stress meal for the patron  

i have enjoy two splendid meal at guy savoy in pari and was truli excit to experi this restaur without have to take an intern flight  

while the recip remain authent the experi is not one i never ever wish to repeat  our dinner for 2 all in includ tip was over 800 this was without an expens bottl of wine but with wine pair by the glass poor execut and select by our deer in headlight sommelier

dear mr guy savoy i am heartili disappoint  perhap it is time to take a greater hand in your us represent  the meal the experi the dine room and especi the servic were a complet miss  i should have never gone here and should have gone right to the mandarin orient hotel to dine in twist by pierr gagnair  

mi two review of the pari guy savoy depict a truli wonder experi that was total worth everi penni spent this was noti rare write negat review usual onli posit one but this was one of those experi 

wow this was by far our worst dine experi in vega  it was the worst spent 700 ever we made a reserv for 7 peopl about 1 month ago sinc we were go to be in town for a trade show our last appoint ran late so four of us show up the restaur late 3 were alreadi there but couldnt be seat until the miss 4 arriv they could have been order drink and appet but instead the tabl sat empti  

we arriv and were told that we could eat but that we would have to be out of our tabl by 9 okay that is fair but how they treat us after that was not  

we had plenti of time to eat in fact we finish 20 minut befor 9 but we kept get pushedth waiter first said that he would choos out appet becaus us read the menu for 2 min was too much he kept remind us that we were in a hurri we rush through our food and at 840 the waiter gave us dessert menus threw some fiddl faddl packag courtesi of the chef on the tabl and said that we could choos dessert and that we might have time to eat it  serious guy 

gratuiti was includ we didnt give a penni more  on the way out we comment to the hostess that they could have handl that situat way differ  underst that we had to be done by 9 they could have sped thing up in the kitchen instead of constant remind us that we need to rush she argu with us instead of apolog  that is not custom servic 

even more disappoint we love michael mina restaur  and plan all michael mina restaur for our trip this michael mina restaur let us down  butamerican fish aria and michael mina bellagio are both excelwe stop in for a quick bite to eat neither of us realli hungri but awar it may be some time befor we get anoth chanc we sat at a tabl at the bar becaus there was no wait our server was friend enough at first but that chang as soon as he surmis we werent the whale he had hope for 

after he made his pitch on the toplin steak special my friend repli that we were actual big fan of their burger it was a nice comment suggest that he would have complet sold us on the steak if we had not alreadi set our mind to the burger instead it was the kind of statement polit peopl use when they want to do someth other than what you suggest 

he just stare at us with this look of disgust and said i think the burger here are crap in a mater of second the waiter demeanor turn complet in the other direct all of a sudden it was if he couldnt get away from our tabl fast enough he cold flew through our burger order like he was audit for the role of flo in alice

som other guy actual deliv our food but as he approach the tabl he proud proclaim welcom to burger king if we didnt now ani better we would have conclud he was audit for the same role he liter drop our burger then turn and walk away 

we dug into our burger still wonder if anyon was go to bring us some silverwar and napkin  oh and some ketchup would be nice too not surpris we had to stop yet anoth server to get the silverwar and our ketchup got drop off some time later the ketchup hit the tabl with such forc it almost spill onto our fri for us

mi friend and i were so involv in our busi discuss that night  it realli should have taken no less than a nake cowgirl floatin across the ceil to get us to pay attent to anyth els but amaz enough the pisspoor servic at this place got both of us drop our jaw in disbelief

not onli do i want to write this review i want to call the corpor headquart of outback steakhous and suggest they fire the entir staff  right down to the manag that allow that kind disgust behavior to take place

hey outback  you have lost me as a custom  forever

oh and the burger were craplet see  horribl servic from a skanki girl serv food that belong in a correct facility

thi had to been one of the veri worst dine for lack of a better word experi ive ever had anywhere

c i post anyth lower than one stari have never paid more than 80 for mexican food in my life  this place was veri expens and the food was decent  i post pictur for you to see  my favorit thing was the civich  they did make strong margarita  the averag meal price was 1218  my chees enchilada were 1300

the one thing agav has go for them is their ambianc and patio  the patio has 4 fire place and the option to sit at the fireplac couch or tabl  the servic is less than averag  we wait for a host to show up to seat us for 5 minut  the server continu forgot to check on us and we had to ask twice for water  and when we ask when he recommend he said everyth  i want to get up and leav right when he said that

i will not be returnso ive been here two more time sinc my previous review and i think unfortun this is go to be my last review of this place and the last time i ever come here

agav and i came out to a rough start when it first open mani year ago and it seem that it has reach it pinnacl a year ago and it down hill  veri quickly

mi wife and i visit on a thursday night to make use of a groupon that i purchas a month ago  i call and made a reserv for 845pm and that went off without a hitch

when i got there it went downhil from there

it was like they onli had one waiter for the entir restaur  we wait forev for our drink our chip refil our order

rock lobster guacamol for an appet to complement the chip was good  the chip ran out and we wait 10 minut for more

our main entre were ok  refil never happen  after wait patient for 30 minut for our waiter to return we went and talk to an employe  who was the hostess hop around merrili and fratern with her friend while servic just went down down dooooown hill

wel we were talk to the hostest say our waiter was nowher to be found and she condescend say hes been help you  hes at your tabl  and he wasnt  then when we walk back to the tabl i saw her give my wife a veri dirti look

im done with this place  agav need to serious look at how theyr treat their custom  it is a shame that this restaur is take up space in summerlin when a restaur that care to give custom servic and earn their money could be here instead

arriv at 845pm  got our check at 955pm  be prepar to wast an entir night if you dare ventur heresorri cornish  you have a good thing go it seem but need some polishingclean  the place was do a realli brisk carryout busi while we were there  veri friend and eclect staff  good beer select too

th pasti were tasti but the temperatur of the fill when reheat was not consist  some hot spot some cool spot  i worri that this could be a recip for food illness

th star killer came just as we were get readi to leav  a small roach came crawl out onto the bar in front of us  gggaaaahhhhddddive been here multipl time and love their food live in california i come here at least onc a month ani foodi know there is more to a restaur experi than a great product an amaz restaur has three basic covered1 custom servic 2 great food offer 3 an overal great experi this place lack custom servic which kill the experi i stood there on a pack tuesday and saw 35 differ employe walk by with no acknowledg that i exist no eye contact no greet no word at all after 10 min and a line out the door i left irrit and tick 

i sympath with the youth movement and the colleg atmospher this place has howev custom servic need to be emphas to the men and women work the floor they are the face of your store and if this trend continu eventu custom will get fed up and go elsewher if i am an owner i would be piss if this negat behavior was go on in my busi the busi acumen is veri import and should be a learn tool to teach the colleg kid the import lesson which can be appli to all differ job titl the staff i saw work tonight look lazi and tire mayb due to the high temperatur of the restaur howev with poor custom servic and lack of a face in the entranc greet me with a smile and a friend greet it leav me feel like you dont want my money and you dont care enough about your custom stand around eventu the attitud of we have a superior product that ppl pay for and they not have to worri about custom servic will come back to bite them in the butt


area for improvement

th waiter should be focus on turn tabl and get the check as soon as the dessert is finish as oppos to walk around with their head cut off more tabl be turn equat to more tip i saw 46 tabl sit talk on their phone when they could have been serv their check or order more food my avg time from start to finish was between 90120 min you cut my time in the restaur to 60 min with effici servic and food run from the kitchen this place could doubl it profit and increas tip 

they need someon to work the front and greet the custom and let them know they are want appreci and they want to provid me with a great meal 

drink out in under 5 min from order i wait 20 min and she forgot about my 2nd beer later in the even and i had to remind her so 30 min for a pint of beertot wait time for 2 drink 50 mins

notif on food time depend on who is work 

challeng your server to turn tabl faster 

server need to be smile and sociali realli dont like give out 1star review but i have to be honest i did not enjoy my soj experi in fact i was frustrat the sushi itself was pretti good we went dure happi hour current 1030pm130am monsat so the price were great unfortun to put it light the servic was lack im too frustrat to bother with detail i hesit even write this review in the first place the bottom line for me is that there are plenti of sushi place in vega with good to great sushi and good to great servic i dont need to return luckili for soj they have enough of a follow 100 review that my lowli 1star wont affect their stellar averag at allel torito use to be good i have been go there sinc i was a kid  late past few year it has been get wors and wors meal come out cold half the time portion are smaller specif the rice and bean which are not half of what they use to be and the servic is not that good  server are friend but they rare rememb to bring your soup or anyth els you ask for everi time we go there not just onc or twice and are slow as hell  my mother in law enchilada kick el torito enchilada ass  food is just not that great not authent as some here claim and is continu get wors  hope they can eventu chang this and right the ship as i use to love el toritobad servic leav a bad after tast and i wont be come back for more 

first time i ate here i love it the pad thai was yummi the ambianc was nice and it was perfect place next to temp cinema make a great go to for a date nightor so i thought 

second visit was about 30 minut prior to close in most restaur that not a huge deal but here it mean they will ask you for your order befor even get to look at the menu remind you everi ten minut that theyr close soon and pretti much stare you down until your uncomfort enough that you can no longer enjoy your meal ensur that you dont leav a singl minut past close fine they dont like to work late note 

fast forward a few month for a stop in at lunch door lock seem were 15 min earli this time no big deal well wait as we wait we see the same woman who was so rude befor the same woman who is alway there she clear see us but doesnt open the doornot until exact 1101 that is you would think she would open the door we were stand at but nope first she open the door on the opposit end then stop to answer the phone then mere unlock the door were stand in front of and walk away as if nobodi was stand there not a smile not a hello not a thank for wait noth 

i thought mayb she recogn us from befor and this was an isol incid but ive now read other review state the same perhap all the posit feedback has gone to her head to the point that good servic has becom irrelev mayb it just as simpl as her not want to work a minut extra i dunno what i do know is that part of what make a dine experi worthwhil at least for me is the servic food with attitud doesnt tast near as good and ill glad go to one of the other ten thai restaur in the area the next time i get a cravedo not  do not

thi review is specif for the chines fast food in the front of the store which is setup similar to panda express  we like the store itself

so at 600 i slam my way out of there vow never to go backso my dad took me here today and bill it as an upscal houston  i think not
thi place is a total houston ripoff  serious the decor is the same the smell when you walk in is the same the server outfit the menu the drink the silverwar  i guess you see the point
so i ask the server are you affili with houston 
he goe off on a stori about how the wcg is an origin concept and much better than houston  yada yada save it for someon who isnt an aficionado of the houston persuasion
if you are go to say all of that and clear be a ripoff of my favorit restaur then you had better live up to the name  and frank they dont  i had the sear ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado surpris houston has the exact same salad  onli better   it was good as i was jones for some tuna  but i could have done without the heavi sesam crust and the drench with dress  my dad has the rotisseri chicken and was so disappoint that they end up take it off of the bill it was cold and dri  we both had freshsqueez arnold palmer  and they had ooki sugarco rim  no thanks
th french fri were excel yay french fri  oh and surpris you can get them with mustardhoney dress just like at houston  though again it wasnt as good
you know it is probabl a 3star restaur but i was so putoff by the whole we arent houston and that restaur suck attitud  when they are so clear tri to be houston that i will not ever be back  if i want houston i will get the real thing and it will tast better
plus i think the name is super lame  the servic was fine the place is fine  but just go get the real thing it is worth the wait

update
i up my star rate to 3 becaus the gm contact me and explain a bunch about the restaur  i realli appreci such person custom servic  he certain didnt have to be so nice  so i will tri wcg again and hope pull the rate up anoth star  i still think the name is funni   

 anoth updat 
i was harass by a fellow review of the wcg who was clear affili with the restaur  this review has no other review and is a bit fishi  i do not appreci be contact to argu about the experi i had and this type of activ destroy the integr of yelp  i will not be return to wcg and neither will anyon i know in az they will all be hear this stori  plus we like houston better anyway so this will not be a lossi feel like this place should be rate in wtfs instead of star becaus if i was rate in wtfs this place would have like the highest score of all time

i went in with a pretti larg group at lunch time and my they were eager to eat all of the sushi so it not like we were wast their time i mean lunch time restaur hungri peopl it all made perfect sense

w wait sever minut to be acknowledg wtf 

onc the hostess came out of the back we notic she was on the phone wtf 

amaz she look at us and went away again without acknowledg us wtf

when she came back she was still on the phone realli wtf

then she point and grunt toward the din room while still on the phone seriously

w sat and she gave us one menu one there were 5 of us we had to ask for more menus when we saw her again she was still on the phone and without a word she went and grab like 2 more menus and kind of threw them at us wtf i cant believ that was even real life

at this point we were all just mad uncomfort like what if we want to ask her for someth more complic than a menu like sushi she was still on the phone when we walk out and bare glanc at us wtf

i guess i cant say anyth about the food becaus i was too busi wtfing to order ani but i definit wouldnt go back so it doesnt matter if the food is the best if i want servic this terribl i can eat at home where my privat cook is never around

that is like 8 wtfs in the condens version of this stori that is like 1 wtf minut for this place great jobi came here sunday august 4th for dinner  i had the lasagna 2 friend had the pizza and 2 other in my group did not eat  it was an averag meal  fast forward to 10 hour later earli monday morn i woke up to a churn stomach went to the restroom where i proceed to spew out red tomato sauc from both end  it was a terribl morn  both of my friend who had pizza woke up and had consider gi discomfort all morn  they werent as bad as me but they were not enjoy life  essenti our monday drive home was miser  the two who did not eat were fine  

i call the restaur wednesday even after i felt better to let them know i had possibl gotten food poison from their restaur  the manag immedi doubt me  blame the sick on too much drink absurd   i had mayb 5 beer the entireti of sunday  so unless a server shove a bottl up where the sun doesnt shine befor serv me i have a hard time blame it on the beer  not to mention im in my 30si went to collegei am fair familiar with alcohol sick and hangov  this was not that

i explain to the manag that there were 5 of us and we all ate at the same place all weekend except for sunday night when onli 3 of us ateth same 3 that got sick      the manag proceed to proclaim that you get food poison 72 hour after ingest  i had to look that upit not true  whi he would lie  i have no idea  he just realli didnt seem to even be open to the notion that his restaur got me sick

regardless i didnt call ask for anythingi onli call to inform them of the event and how my friend and i narrow it down to their establish  the manag ask for my contact info and told me their general manag would get back to me in 24 hour  it has been 5 day  not expect that phone calland im not expect to ever eat at a wolfgang puke establish againthe food ive tri is soso but nice decor and the owner and staff are veri friend  

the naan can be hit or miss here  one time it tast like pita bread mayb they ran out and anoth time it tast like ok naan out of the tandoor

th chick tikka masala is decent  vindaloo is not great in fact most of their curri like the mantra masala tast alik just differ heat level  have tri the tandoor mix grill and it was satisfactori  the malai kofta is decent but the gravi is more like a soup  

also one thing i notic about this place is that the dish are consist underseason  i read somewher that most american consid indian food to be salti so mayb this is an overreact to that  not sure  but i alway have to add salt to the entrees

pr is a kinda high and they charg you a lot for everi littl thing  rice raita mango picklim onli give one star becaus i have to to be abl to rate the busi ayayay where do i start 

veggi khorma had legum in it and tast noth like a khorma no cauliflow no potato no green pea 

chicken tikka masala was heavi in creamlack spice cream is cheaper than spices

ric portion was a 3oz dish from a nearbi mandalay bay hotel  casino yes we flip it over  my husband is 65 280lb weve never had this prob anywher else

raita yogurt portion was more than the rice but it had water mix in and the season was way offno cumin too much  anis seed no cucumb or carrot or spices

food was yucki expens and miniatur 

no buffet wtf that like an indian rest staple

oh andw complain to the waiter he said owner will be in later and there was noth he could doa we were leav the owner came and our waiter told him our problemh said give me a minmi husband said were obvious not import enough so we left and im now vent on here shoulda caught me at the door buddyboy

a bit of background 
ive probabl ate at more indian restaur around the world than anyth else

i had an indian restaur cater my 150 parti indianthem bridal shower  restaur sale went up 20 in the follow 6 week becaus my guest love their foodmy husband and i were invit by friend back in novemb 2012 at first we realli enjoy it then start notic unprofession attitud by the owner such as alcohol on the breath and shout at the staff in front of patron 

the owner claim that former patron just hung out without purchas anyth is erron and inflammatori furthermor these patron are person respons for bring in mani new customers

i fulli expect to have the owner remov this negat review that is his prerog howev just know thisword get around marcosushi waaher my order 

sushi was the server ever gonna take an order

sushi wait 

sushi watttt theee fuck

im sit in bamboo jail as i write with all the yelper here for a uye we start at 6pm it is now 850pm as i start this review and we are sit wait on them transact everyon out

food is still decent howev servic is rude and ineffici from our main server one half of the tabl was get servic and the other half where i was sit was kinda ignor a lot more wait more to put order etc hed take their order leav come back with someth for them and then we would have to tri to flag him wed wave him hed say hell be back and doesnt come back to us or he would walk pass us like we didnt wave at all a few peopl had lost order and instead of say someth kind like sorri let me go check on that and get it outit more of remark like we never put the order you got it no someon els got it etc one of our yelper ask three time to get her first order when the other side alreadi on their 2nd round of order 

i was gonna do 3 star but now with tge transact im mif first they wont split the bill and kinda told us we had to just deal with it becaus theyr busi  we comput what we all owe and wrote in the back which card to charg what now someth with pos be the onli one for order and transact so they dont want to back up order by transact all us out so theyll transact when order arent come in we had a korean speak yelper go talk to him and he was rude about it so she went to talk to the manag who said he will do it in a bit we had to wait for him and explain everyth it took like 20 minut of discuss thing and explain how we wrote down what befor they went to the back to start we have no choic but to wait im sorri but one thing i learn about restaur hospit that turnov is import becaus wait for a check lower the impress farther than wait a bit for good food peopl are done and want to just go we final got our receipt back and

they charg my credit card for two drink and two ayc 

we wrote everyth down clear on the back on to receipt we put the last 4 digit of each card to identifi them and what amount to charg to each card how is that not clear enough they charg me for someon els 

okay so basic then they should give me some cash back then bring back the cash peopl some chang well first time they not onli gave me less than what i was owe but also no chang for peopl with cash they final gave it and we left at 940pm

50 minut to transact is pretti crazi long 

i know it easi to say that well it a pretti atyp ef up situat that mayb with the busi place and a waitstaff that doesnt micromanag it well it went down south fast howev i do have previous visit where i do specif state how odd the servic was odd not friend and ineffici so that hold true that the waiter servic isnt that good here also it got super busi on my last visit toward the end of my dinner and i also wait 20 minut to get a mochi and 15 minut more to get my check back to sign so i was held hostag prior to this so no it can happen to you in some degre 

pleas retrain the staffand hire some good server the busboy was polit and did more than just remov plate by check order and refil drink pleas make him a server and mayb make your rude server a busboy until he learn how to talk to peopl 

i dont deni the ayc is good but if you go then dont go at peak hour dont sit at a tabl onli with the nice sushi bar guy and do cash if you have a parti split the check 

look at how thorough i was in take pictur and review individu item becaus i want peopl to come with my last review howev after this incid i am not recommend it or come back i was frustrat all throughout the meal and exasper at how i was charg and then shortchang cashback i havent felt this way about a dine experi in a long time so 1 star isnt out of line

ther are mani ayc area in the area includ my favorit island sushi whose staff is pure aloha hospitality

upd owner sent a apologet notei give him kudo for that and wouldv given a star for his profession then a week later i get a anonym note from someon in henderson talk about me give bad review and how dare i destroy famili given that i onli have 15 1 star review out of near 500 and havent given a bad review in age it made me wonder then i found out other peopl got the same messag that dine with me here so it doesnt take two to figur out our crabbi server didnt like what we said so unprofession and coward your server realli made sure we dont come backim sad for 3 reasons

1 sushi wa is a far drive from my resid and from work  but becaus my friend rave about this place i realli want to take the time and drive to tri it

2 my favorit kind of sushi which is the simpl salmon sake nigiri was laid on top of a super huge portion of rice and more import the fish was not fresh  huge disappointment

3 my favorit roll which is the spici tuna over crispi fri rice here was bland  the fish look like it has been out for day and they dont use fresh jalapeno  make no sens  i was a bit disgusted

i also had their yellowtail nigiri also not fresh  i tri their garlic edamam no tast and not even a hint of garlic  when you say there is go to be garlic in a dish i better tast it  it as if they like they completey forgot the ingredi and it in the freakin name  boo  then i had their ultim garlic tuna rolland thun thun thunagain no tast of ani garlic  the roll even sit on a bowl of soup that onli make it even wors becaus the soup base doesnt tast like anyth but yuck  i couldnt believ my dismay

th one star goe to one appet fri oyster and one roll volcano roll  the volcano roll was a littl too much on the sauci side that if i had to finish it myself i would feel guilti for my becaus of all the mayo clog up my heart valv  but becaus it had sauc it was the onli roll that had ani flavor

thi was a huge disappoint  not onli the tast but the fish wasnt fresh  fresh come first

th wait  staff though was realli nice and the place is decor nice kind of too fanci though  also they over do the food present  they need to work on the food tast rather than the present  just becaus someth look good doe not mean it tast good   

ill end on a posit note though  they do have coffe mochi for dessert  not mani ayc sushi place have this mochi flavor  


if my friend convinc me to go back to tri their order i dont know  becaus the fish might still be from todayyou know i made a yelp account just to give this restaur this review i am so appal at the servic we receiv today that i need to let yall know to stay the hell away

first ive been here week for the past 3 month have they rememb me no howev the onli constant with my visit is that i alway come here with my best friend who happen to be koreanamerican therefor in previous visit we have receiv fast servic and the staff has alway been veri efficient


i cannot say that ill be go back after this point and as a former regular this make me sad i hate to say that this is a racial fuel situat and that it was a rare occurr but read these other review solidifi my belief that it quit the opposite

today experi was so stark differ from my other visit that i almost couldnt believ it was the same restaur 

this time i came with two other femal caucasian like myself we walk in and after be notic 10 min later by a male busser were offer the worst tabl by the kitchen between bar in an otherwis complet restaur 

we polit declin and request a booth near the sushi bar as ive notic the servic improv dramat the closer you are to the chef we were seat then ignor for 20 min with no other greet or hello as the staff was all intent watch a basketbal game behind the counter


wtf 

final the manag in a bright purpl polo came to take our order and ask if we were do ayc we all said yes and he immedi walk away toward the tv without ask what we want to order

wtf 2

i flag him down and order a miso soup and edamam for starter and we order a few roll between the three of us 

at this point the owner lose all interest in us and send over a woman in a red polo who had the air of a manag who actual was a server start check on us 

and by check on us i mean she stood impati watch us eat and for some reason it was awkward and uncomfort 

then came the drama

w had order a tiger roll avoid it and when it arriv the tuna that lay on top was a dark brown color and when put in the soy sauc it complet disintegrated

w flag down the red polo woman and told her we couldnt eat that roll for the next twenti minut we were argu with be told that it was spici tuna and that whi it was fall apart and a rotten color

 we ask to trade for anoth roll as it was clear ined then the woman told us that we could onli get anoth tiger roll as a replac we simpli did not want anoth and she was have a hard time understand this concept  

she gave up exasper said fine what els do you want and we order a shrimp tempura roll load with rice and avocado btw 

we thought it was over when the purpl polo manag came up after ignor us in the begin  with the red polo woman and brought back the offens roll in question 

and one again we weren lectur on how brown tuna impli that it spici and that there was noth wrong with it and we need to eat it or get anoth tuna roll

at this point we were in a state of shock and just ask to replac the roll as we were not pay for it or eat it or we would leave

they final gave up at this point and the meal was just entir ruined

regardless
oth thing to note

1 the ac is ice cold we were miser from start to finish
2 the busser girl was amaz and took trash off of our tabl immedi after it was place down and had the best demeanor of the three staff member we came in contact with
3 there is appar a limit on mochi and ice cream howev when i offer to pay more for extra mochi they said theyd throw it in for free ummmmmmm is there ani consist here

th rest of the servic went downhil from there and is not even worth mention as we were just disappoint and not happi to be there

i had brought my friend as a way of show them where the good sushi was at and left embarrass and humili 

great servic guyso now i remember

i rememb whi i never make the trip down here on saturday mornings
i rememb whi the market is more craft than produce
i rememb whi regular groceri store get my busi when i grew up shop at a public market

i dont go to phoenix farmer market becaus there are no farmer there  the place is over run with ladi who make craft and a few artist  there are prepar food vendor sell their not so interest food at boutiqu price  there were a coupl i found interest enough to consid the pickl ladi boutiqu chocol and eastern european bakeri good come to mind but the rest were a wast of my time

for ani produc market to grow and be success they have to offer someth better than the groceri store  that someth better is usual a cheaper price  it is easier for vendor to do so becaus they dont have the overhead of a store and all the associ expens  most citi have market where the vendor pull up their step van open the back and liter sell out of the back of the truck  the phoenix market vendor dont seem to be awar of this  they bring a red wagon of produc out of their yard and display it in littl packag  they think we should all pay extra becaus they are local  as long as they charg at least twice as much for their good as ani other store in town there is no reason for peopl to buy other than the feel of be charit  in my opinion there are better chariti than overpay to a vendor who feel like the world owe it to them for be local  simpl law of suppli and demand  as long as they price is lower elsewher they wont have my support

that doesnt mean i dont support local grower  i can stop at ani number of market and get flower for half what i saw be charg today 7 is a littl steep for a bunch of wildflow when i can get a bunch of daffodil for 149 at my corner store  i can buy hickman egg at most local store for less and shamrock is local as well  the one i found particular insult was a seedl basil plant for 7 while a huge bushi plant in a 7 pot is less than half that at a regular  store  if i want a seedl plant in a dixi cup i can push a seed in some dirt and wait for 3 day too

nop i wont be buy thing at the phoenix market  i dont need to pay a premium to the vendor for the privileg of find them all in one place on a saturday morn  i will probabl do better stop at the produc stand along 99th ave on my way home from work everi now and then or the truck that park on the corner on the outer edg of our citithis review is onli for the butcher 

conversation
m what cut of meat is best for kabobs
butch 1 eye roll aaaaaa what out there
m well i heard a sirloin is good
butch 1  sure
m can i pick one out and can you cut it up for me in kabob chunks
butch 1 to butcher 2 big eye roll can we cut meat up
butch 2 uuuuuuu yah i guess well ummmm  is there some out there cut up
butch 1  i mean i guess we could but uh i just well uhhh clean  uhhh
m dont worri about it see ya later a hole it onli 4pm dont clean yet  you may have to keep work 

i think they were too busi play pocket ping pong to bother they like work with meat their own

im usual not this bitter it just the whole custom servic thing get me everi time  in a bad mood  too bad fake itthis joint might be the shit but ill never know

i am confid in my formula for a good thai place a grungi ghettofi exterior with a clean and tidi interior pack with actual thai folk

excit by the nasti dirti exterior of the build and it sketchi locat i was disappoint to find the insid to be less than spotless

i was quick if nonchal greet and seat with a menu among about 23 other full tables

aft sit over 10 minut with nari a glass of water or a peep out of the staff i had hope that the approach server was on the way to take my order

ala my hope were dash when the server went to the tabl that was alreadi busi enjoy their meal and proceed to take a togo order from them so that it could be readi when they left

se that the other two tabl hadnt receiv food yet and had been there long enough to deplet their thai tea complet i was veri upset to know that i would be sit starv wait for my food to be cook after these folk who were alreadi eat their food had their togo order cook  

uh uh  i left the menu id near memor by this point and my nonexist glass of water on the tabl and skeedaddlfirst off i will never patron roy in chandler ever again pleas read on to see why

a friend and i went for aloha hour and it was awesom everyth on the hh menu is onli 5   we enjoy everyth from the food drink  servic that we decid to come back and tri their dinner menu

942010
mi friend tri the hibachi style grill salmon they both were quit pleas perfect portion size abov averag qualiti but yet still a bit pricey nonetheless the dish was quit satisfi 

for my meal i had the hawaiian style misoyaki butterfish  it came with black forbidden rice and bok choy  each flaki bite was meltinyourmouth delici  excel choice

thi is where it get ugly
a our averag servic was about to conclud the waiter drop our check off i ask him for anoth cup of coffe and as he pull his hand back from deliv the check he knock a quarter glass of wine all over my friend and her phone he proceed to apolog and clean a portion of it up then walk away he never return for the coffe i ask for nor did he offer to refil my friend 8 glass of wine i gave him time to reconcil as i saw him pace back and forth but to no avail i had to chase him down for my refil on coffe despit my friend get wine spill over her without compens our parti decid to reflect our displeasur through our tip 8 oppos to an open verbal complaint howev our waiter wasnt pleas with his gratuiti he came back to the tabl after he discov his low tip yes he actual had the nerv to return to our tabl as if he didnt understand whi he receiv a low tip he spill wine which we had paid for on the custom without compens for it what did he expect 
he came back to the tabl ask if we were displeas with his servic astonish by his ignor we explain to him what we were displeas with get this he didnt think spill the wine over my friend wasnt a big deal becaus he thought it was a small amount and that she was finish anyway imagin a waiter spill a paid for glass of wine over you and justifi it becaus you were almost done anyway absolut ridicul plus what did he expect from us at that point did he expect that we would chang our mind and tip him more the waiter apolog onc more and we just got up and left
our server thoma  the absolut most ungrat inappropri  rude bastard of a server ive ever encount 
the manag was of no assist either just a note in the servic industri there is no verbal apolog that is accept in the servic industri the onli apolog come in the form of compens the manag apolog but ask if we would like to have gift certif that like say may i say sorri to you he shouldv given not ask to give put the onus on the custom is an insult we declin sinc accept would paint us as opportunists

bottom line you expect abov the standard level of servic when your shell out 2540 per entre  so even though the food was great the horribl experi with how we were treat is caus enough to never return to this locat  it like be slap in the face but say it okay becaus the food was wonderfulno thank youcloseit friday night and i was crave some sushi but i didnt feel like drive all the way to yama for some nommi sushi  i then decid that i was go to tri someth new sinc it been awhil i tri a new sushi joint i did some research on here nearest to the hous and this place came up first for all you stalker yes i live in north las vega  give you an idea how much i love yama 20 mile away and been there over 30 time i think i got duchess status on there p anywho back to my point 

so this place is locat on the corner of centenni parkway and simmon right across from fresh and easi southeast corner of simmon where the starbuck is at

th ayc sushi is 2695pp which i thought a bit pricey for someth i am tri new i was think of go down the street to sage sushi for coupl buck less but i went here for the adventur with my daughter so we get there at about 1010pm the yelp ad say they close at 1130 so i thought cool we got time soon as we sat down server ask us for our drink and the sushi bar chef ask for my order 19 minut later tell me that i have 1 more minut to ordermind you i onli have order the follow spici tuna roll and rainbow roll edamam i ask whi hes give me last call he said that he has to close his section by 1030 i told him i just got there so he told me order more so i just pick random one i dont normal order a lasagna roll cream chees base bake roll with scallop and ahi poke tuna salad 

how was it
non of the fish tuna use in my roll smell or tast fresh it was fishi and fish isnt suppos to smell and tast fishi if it fresh so yeah it was gross
i had to wash down my food with red bean ice cream and diet coke and i never drink soda at an ayc joint i usual drink water with lemon but that was too harsh the lemon brought out the stale of the fish even more when i went ahead and chase my stale sushi fish with wateryuk

verdict 62 later plus 20 tip becaus i just do 20 as rule of thumb i was out of there by mere 11pm total of 45min 75 less in my pocket and not veri happi sinc it  had left a funni tast in my mouth literally
i aint never gonna come back psshhhhh

this is what i get for cheat on yama i love you yamai feel sad to say thisbecaus i know it is local own by a small familybut yucko  i went there to lunch hesit but my friend want to go there  

the place felt old and dirti too big for too few peopl and too quiet

i had the egg salad sandwich  it was bland and bore and serv between two slice of stale white bread

mi friend got a chicken salad and i could tell it was disgustingsh bare made her way through it

th ice tea was okbut it was realli disappoint and i fear it is on it last leg unless some chang are madejust terribl even for a 24 hour cafe  

i came here becaus well just look at these other review  this place look great right  fellow yelper how could you fail me so miserably

i made a special trip  not there to gambl just to have breakfast  ive had better food at nurs homes

th egg benedict was unrecogniz as such  is that megaplex nacho chees   i didnt even want to tri it becaus it look so hideous  like congeal latex

and the egg were not even remot poach  more like hard boil into some thing beyond a solid  as in like mayb someth one would find on the surfac jupit  

and the grit  well i guess i should know better than to order grit in las vega but   these were somehow both wateri and graini at the same time  

i kept look for the hidden camera becaus sure i was be punked

top it off with a bloodi mari that was basic clamato juic and a half shot vodka with a touch of tabasco  ie about the most uninspir version of a bloodi mari ive ever had the displeasur of drink  

i rare send back food and then not give them the opportun to tri again  but this place was clear beyond all redemptoh no 


oh no no no no no 


you know those rare occur when you go to a restaur sit down perus the menu and settl for someth even though it wasnt what you realli wanted

you know those odd time when you get the food put in front of you and from the first bite you know immedi someth is tast wrong doesnt tast veri good at all actual but yet you keep eat anyway

ev had it happen where an hour after you finish the meal you know you had no busi eat you feel like your insid are fight back from the absolut toxic nasti you have forc upon your body

yeahyou know exact what i am talk about  ghost bile is form in your throat now as you rememb a meal just like this 

pizza palac may have turn me off of calzon for life 

other than that the servic was decent and the decor was expect vegasthemeri  the price seem a littl high for the horrid sludg they put in front of you but then again i dont usual like to pay to be sick to my stomachok so i go in think ill have a lite breakfast and a littl someth to drink 

cute place 

i see the chalkboard special  it sound good and was name after me 

i decid to order the special and an ice dirti chai soy latt 
i am told they are out of some of the ingredi for the breakfast sandwich i wantedr 

than whi the hell is it still on the chalkboard 

i just stick with the drink then i watch her make it with a few pump of the chai syrup a whole damn lot of vanilla soy milk and a shot of espresso 

im glad i pass on the food becaus after handl my money she proceed to chop up tomato for previous custom order with unwash bare hand dirti fingernail and chip polish to boot 

quit disgust unsanitari if you ask me 

as for my drink to be perfect honest and you know i ami had a few sip and threw it away 5 down the drain 

there was absolut no hint of chai to be tast it was extrem thick with a weird tast and their crushedshav ice doe not do ice drink ani favor unless mayb it water 

im sorri but for a place who copi the starbuck logo into a spoof to put it down better hope they blow the door off of them and they dontthe onli thing wors than their mediocr food turn out to be their complet rude and condescend staff 

i have given ken more busi than they ever deserv over the past coupl of year sole due to it close proxim to home and work the experi i had there last weekend will certain be my last 

in the past i had order thing which didnt tast that fresh one particular time i order uni sea urchin a favorit of mine i will forego ani comparison in tast for the sake of the weari but let just say it was horribl so i polit sent it back onli to be told when the waitress return that uni was not in season so i should natur know this hmmm how about you just apolog and not blame the custom for foolish eat what you served

th experi this past weekend was veri similar the spici yellowtail tast like it had been left in tupperwar in the sun for a day or two so i polit sent it back i was told that perhap yellowtail isnt my fish as though i had never had a bite of sushi befor in my life

appar at ken the custom is alway wrong be warn go elsewher like sushi eye or one of sever other in the area who serv qualiti food without insultim warn you alreadi i am veri grumpi in this review more than usual i am a veri lenient yelper most of the time this one isnt go to be a pretti one

oh man i was realli look forward to this meal have to drive 30min for the highlyrecommend sushi ken itd be worth it right i had even skip lunch in the hope to be famish and love everi bite of the dinner even more than normal

          it was the worst japanes food ive ever had

i had the beef curri and tonkatsu ramen combin with a salad the salad was colorless and wilt and the dress i love japanes dress was over vinegartast the beef curri was ok but i make better japanes curri at home use the curri cube in the box sold at supermarket 

the tonkatsu ramenshould not have been call such the ramen tast worst than instant ramen it was mushi there was no tast in the broth of marrowi good it was a salti lifeless broth with shrivel bamboo shoot too much wakam and one measli thin slice of charsiu i had about 4 bite and left the rest to die i didnt even take it home to tri to remedi it

mi husband had the tempura bowl and shoyu ramen combin with an edamam sideth edamam was the grayestgreen shade id ever seen frozen edamam from the supermarket look better than that his tempura bowl was bizarregon was the flaki crunchi panko bread what was brought out was a glazi weird crust abomin that was over sweet i would like to dip my tempura myself thank you veri much his shoyu ramen was terribl salti my husband even like thing veri salti and he couldnt drink it he also left 90 of his bowl untouch 

the onli thing they didnt mess up was their california roll which is pretti imposs to mess up so thank good for that 

and the servic terribl absolut terribl we were a tabl of 9 and they could have care less the 15 was alreadi includ in the bill so mayb that whi they didnt even bother to tri to be nice to us the ladi were so mean it look like they just hate everyon they were serv and usual japanes waiter are sooooo nice i know caus i use to wait tabl alongsid cowork who had just immigr from japan

funni thing is the rest of the tabl realli enjoy their food updat one of them messag me after read this review to tell me she actual didnt like the foodlol i guess my husband and i were not the onli one that didnt enjoy it nobodi enjoy the servic though i can assur you of that lolwow  that all i have to say  not sure what happen sinc the last time i was here but it was like go to a complet differ restaur  horribl rude servic from both of the waitress not just from the one that all the other peopl here have mentionedtal nasti and alway has a look on her face like someon just took a crap in her cereal  and i sort of got the impress that becaus i am gaijin ie not japanes i may have piss them off even more  food still tast the same great but the ambianc and the attitud realli realli rub me the wrong way  needless to sayno tip  i would have relish the opportun that the other review had when tall and nasti follow you out to the park lot and demand a tipi guarante she wouldnt have found that to be a pleasant experi  you all just lost a custom and a fancongratul nasti facehow do you say retard in spanish

w order fish filet meal and chees burger happi meal ketchup and onion only

w got the kid meal and a fish sandwich with ketchup and onionwtf who doe that on the fish come onabsolut not the best italian food i have ever had be from out of town dalla tx this is not a veri good italian restauaur veri effect by the mob from way back then and al capon pic all over the place give me a breakh was main a chicago mobster

i had the lasagna and a third of it was burn and they still serv it to me  i had gas and stomach issu all day the next day horriblyuck this place suck the decor is cool and total mob scene but the food is so nasti not even close to be authent italian food i got 4 small frozen ravioli for 30 bucksreal the servic suck as well stay away and tri parma or roma insteadhad dinner here last night for my father birthday and to put it lightlyw werent happi the back of their menu even say to state ani complaint befor you leav and ask you not to be a jimmi the weasel red flag much

for starter the food was noth spectacular and extrem overpr i had the saw off sausag and pepper which was 22 cmon now the dish was near all pasta and pepper with veri littl sausag my dad had the extrem small portion gotti chicken my wife had the fettuccin alfredo and actual left the restaur say she was still hungri dont get me wrong the food was okaynot spectacular but okay

now im not one to complain about a restaur especi when the food is okay my famili and i enjoy tri new place and your not alway go to have a great experi howev capo had me readi to refus pay the bill we use a 25 for 50 groupon last night and capo work the system to where the groupon is useless we had 4 adult and my 4 year old son who share a plate with the groupon appli our bill was 7777 12777 without howev the waitress took it upon herself to add 2555 for gratuiti put the bill back up to 10332 with the price of my groupon the bill was actual 055 higher than it would have been without a tip and to be honest the servic we receiv didnt deserv anywher near a 25 tip onc they took the credit card the waitress even went as far as write the tip amount on the credit card slip herself correct me if im wrong but i believ that illegal

now i realiz mani groupon have fine print state there will be an ad gratuiti or someth but not in capo groupon be warn this place has other review about the busi scam custom and now i see whi they make the groupon useless by ad their own tip at their chosen amount i will never return to this place and will contact groupon in attempt to have these theiv remov from their site now i just have to hope they didnt steal my credit card infoatroci servic my trip here led to a shout match with the manag we purchas a groupon for a parti of four the other coupl cancel and the restaur manag refus to honor the groupon even though it would have result in us spend more money than we would have

appar they are all good on cash here so dont bother give them ani of your never had a wors dine or in this case a notdin experi in my life 

cant wait to see this place turn into more park lot their terribl manag is go to make that happen sooner than latercome to vega i was told i must tri this place the food is delici the atmospher is fun and it was a must experi 

after come here i wont be come back the even start out on a posit like the idea and the decor and atmospher but the food was sub par for the price it said steakhous so i ventur for the 40 steak my friend had to chang her order due to them be out of food and she was also not impress with the select 

we did make reserv and ask about the special to make sure it was still go on when we call we were assur it was howev after we ate the waitress bring the bill and after inspect find out the special was not honor  she then told us that the special was for local onli and we were clear not local 

they did final honor the discount but not without complaint  the waitress told me that next time i just need to be awar mayb i shouldv read more review or mayb they should mention that when call to make reserv  either way there will be no next time for this patronthe greatest thing about this place is the entranc through the front door past that everyth goe downhil i get that this place is tri to go for the italian mafia pseudo rude chicago hard ass mental but the peopl are just not hospit when greet at the host stand they made me sit like a leper on these gross banquet chair to wait for my tabl rather than invit me to sit at the empti bar and grab a drink the ambianc is kind of interest but when you actual look at what go on you realiz that the light are just turn complet off it almost pitch black there kind of a cool loung singer that play piano and doe frank sinatra song but hes not veri good and it get realli annoy after 3 song 
the food is the worst part about this place it just downright bad it one thing if the place was super cheap and not tri to be a nice restaur it not exact cheap i had a dri crusti meatbal appet a bore caesar salad and a complet tasteless eggplant parm while i was eat my 22 eggplant park i was legitim think how i would have rather gone down the street to trader joe and eaten the microwav eggplant parm that they have for 499
the servic is bad to averag but i think that part of it simpli has to do with how dark this place is noon can see anyth our waitress ask us for our drink order without bring over a drink menu and she never came back to ask if we want a second drink
i just think this place tri to focus on the gimmick too much and is not understand that they need to provid an actual dine experioverpr and to be honest your realli just pay for the speakeasi experience

mad rsvp for 745 got there 5 minut earlylast one to be seat had to go tp a waitor or manag for a tableeveryon els who came in way after us got to be seat first yay awesom isnt got seat 30 minut after the rsvp ppl who had 8 oclock rsvp got seat regardless  talk to a manag and we got seat but with sarcasmgreat way to start a birthday dinner isnt douch bag manager servic woot we were inform we had to make a memo for the both hello what the point if there was a small tabl alreadi avail and everyon who rsvp at 8pm got in ahead of us still stay sinc we wait 30 minut for the oh so pompus ownermanag not to sit us and just have us wait like sit ducksatleast the staff are fine

thank you capo for make my birthday wonderspring restaur week 2013 review

thi place was a nightmar to get into not one person cross the driveway would let me through so when i final got through i was happi they had valet this was my first time eat here so i had no expect onli thing i knew about this place was the beef wellington theyr known for when we were seat the first thing i notic was the wainscot had old food particl all over it disgust it appear no one has wipe down the area in year i had to scoot away becaus i didnt want someon els food from last year on my arm 

for dinner i start out with the wollenski salad this was soak in salad dress there was a pile of it at the bottom of the dish i love a good salad and this was noth special i tri the deconstruct beef wellington i order it medium well and it came out tartar it was bright red in the middl all the way through i have a huge fear of return food so i tri my best to eat this but just could not get it down it was smother in foie gras  mushroom so overwhelm end it with the coconut cake i took 2 bite and was done it tast old like it had been made day befor this was by far the most disappoint restaur week meal i had i would never returnstart great but after the waiter took my credit card and tip himself 1000 more than i wrote onli to find out a few day later when i get home i expect more from a fanci restaur like smith and wolenski so not impressed

mi steak was over cook and my drink order was mess upthere are certain a lot of peopl who think that red rock is one of the best local casino in town and i will admit that it had a lot go for it 

that is it had a lot go for it 

over the past two year i have watch as this onc great red rock has slowli sour into a joke that is not at all funni there seem to be no aspect of this casino that has not deterior in qualiti with the rare except of the yard hous which is not associ with the casino

but let keep the focus of this review to the feast buffet i have eaten at the feast buffet on a veri regular basi for sever year although it had been a few month sinc i was last there with some friend in town it was a good option for a good budget meal so we went this past sunday

first of all i am suppos to be a vip of the station casino with a presidenti status that was earn almost complet at the red rock the presid status is suppos to get me a 50 discount on the buffet but it onli amount to about 25 

so the sunday night buffet is 19 per person 15 after my vip discount one would think at those price we were about to be pamper with some great food choic 

boy were we wrong  veri wrong

let just sum this all up with a refer that i think we can all relat to  the food qualiti and choic was what one would expect to find at sizzler but of cours at twice the price 

there were less option to choos from than there use to be and what was there was crap just pure crap no prime rib shrimp or crab leg someth they were call sushi ha and a plenti collect of some of the cheapest menu item a buffet can offer 

it remind us of a cattl feed lot trough of a food like substanc that all tast the same

crap  pure crapthey chose not to honor a 200 gift certif we gave our parent over a year ago my parent winter in scottsdal and my father call last spring to make sure they would take the gift certif when he and my mom return this year when ask whi they chang their mind the femal binkley employe state we felt we were be taken advantag ofdrop them to one star after receiv this messag from the owner

you should be arrest for your food photo i can show you how to proper cut sear and present food after you bail me out for make biali i want to teach you how to proper sear a scallop you call me out i accept walk the talk brother man you cant cook to save your life dont worri about the bialys

th bagel were solid but this owner is clear quit the dick i may have move away from madison but there no way id recommend anyon go back and support this busi certain not with attitude

oh and fyi the biali suck they arent biali and they certain dont tast like themive been lucki enough to experi two other superb churrascaria to know that pampa churrascaria is no good 

first of all the benefit of go to a churrascaria is to be abl to sampl mani mani differ type of meat i honest feel like at pampa they onli have about 5 that is includ the grill pineappl none of the meat were top qualiti like what ive previous experienc and they have no chicken heart bleh 

we also order the seafood option as well and it pretti much as bad as the meat the scallop and shrimp were tasteless ahi tuna overcook and the rest of the platter left me feel unappet 

the pitcher of sangria we order can hard pass for sangria with no fruit in it and no fruiti tast it fell short of be just cheap wine

lucki for us our friend had a coupon for 100 off we all end up pay short of 50 each which is not bad for a churrascaria but i will never come back to pampa againboth my friend and i got sick eat here over the weekend  had a crave for some won ton noodl and i realli didnt want to drive or catch a cab to go some place els  big mistak  the broth was warm the noodl were soggi and the won ton was bare cook  it veri expens by the way  you are look at around 14 dollar for a bowl of noodl  sam woo in spring mountain road is better if you are will to catch a cab out there  the wok at the mgm is cool too if you want to walk across to mgm  hate to say this but if i had to stay at the mandalay bay again i might have to eat there againi guess i wont be stay at the mandalay bayhahahaha  if you would like to eat at a great authent chines restaur off the striptri joy houswow realli 

i was way too hungov to check yelp befor come here  that the last time i make that mistak  it was way overpr and flavorless  our group had the wonton soup with noodl  the broth was like boil water  i had the lunch special with mongolian beef and hot and sour soup  some special at almost 20 buck  not much beef  also there were fli in the restaur  i could accept that at a hole in the wall joint not a place insid mandalay 

pleas do not wast your money hereoh my do these peopl deserv their 25 stars

i have been go to this place for as long as i can rememb everi time that my tradeshow pop up at mandalay bay and it get wors and wors and final  disaster

first i have to say that they have this incred amus waitress who is ani other cantones style hong kong restaur would be just as incomprehens but alaswould onli serv you great food even if it was still move when it arriv live in hong kong i met plenti of ladi like this and none would have ever remain in a job at such a terribl excus of a chines restaur even by qwai lo standard  this was a disaster

w had a bunch of dish the fish was fishi in smell the noodl  bland the chicken tast better in those free sampl given out at shop mall 

it was honest one of the worst place i have eaten food at  period

th hotel gave me a 100 dollar gift certif after we complain about our 45 meal they own the noodl shop and if they ever bother to read their review it is a real wonder whi they dont switch up the chefsstaff and manag  fastbe care not to doubl tip

th first time we came here everyth was aok no problem im think ill come back again and review this place when i have multipl visit unfortun the second visit was the last visit for me our waiter took it upon himself to give himself a 18 tip automat we were just a parti of 4 with a babi i saw him do the same thing to a korean coupl with three kid i cant believ he had ball to do that to a fellow korean  some korean restaur i go to take care of other korean preferenti cmon you know it true  at least our waiter that day was an equal opportunisticegotist person with an endeavor for shadi busi practic on all peopl he took 18abov averag tip typic for 6 or more in a parti for some lack luster servic he didnt even refil our glass with water onc  mayb i wouldnt be so piss if he just took a 15 tip or if there was someth state gratuiti was automat ad to the billguess he thought high of his level of servic though   hell if he just refil our water i would have given him a 20 tip i was in the fb industri i know how it goe immacul servic earn 30 from meeasi mayb he thought he was the bombdigg of a server or was just tire of foreign visit vega and stif him heck i sympath european and some asian from abroad dont tip diddly

in addit to the tip escapad my sister ask our waiter for a bowl behind the counter  he was unnerv and said he would bring it to our tabl 57 minut later the bowl arriv  he was too busi calcul and count his tip  no kid the bowl was right behind him he could have just turn around grab the bowl behind him and hand it to my sister unbeliev i guess that earn him his autotip in his mind  could be a new thing in vega too when 5 or more are gratuiti includ now would be nice to know if that the casenoth about gratuiti is state anywher and he fail to mention he ad the tip alreadi  our bill just had the total almost doubl tip him  good thing we fought over who would pay  wouldnt have notic otherwise

anyway the soondubu tofu soup here is pretti good despit onli receiv a hand of banchan item  if you do come here though check your bill first  or dont check itmayb youll receiv averag servic and the autotip is ok with you  i high doubt it though that guy just doe the basic and deliv your food

i cant believ it took anoth bad experi at a restaur to get me to write a review on yelp again  geezwe were starv after we arriv in vega too bad we decid to eat here for our first ventur it was conveni but that not say a lot so were lot of things

what not good here

expens food that was just ok

mi meal didnt come out with the other three i had to flag down a differ server and ask about my meal i guess our server was done with us

you cant get a glass of ice water here well you can but you have to pay for it a bottl of water onli for sever dollar no tap water serv here no glass no ice weird well it the water is a top commod thing

ok time to pay our hotel had given us coupon we each had 10 off we didnt want to do anyth strang we were just two coupl who want to split the bill dont tri this here 

our server would not could not did not split our bill it had alreadi been rung up she said and no way to chang that now so we could onli appli one coupon and she wasnt happi about that even as the bill had been rung up she saw the coupon when we sat down but said noth and did not take them had she perhap not been in such a hurri to get back to her friend mayb she couldv paid more attent to our order then she went into her diatrib about us not have told her we were use coupon from the getgo blah bah blah ok whatev we did but whatever

if this place wasnt so pricey for the rotten food and no drink water we would not have want or care about get ani  off at all

sh said we could take it off her tip

w didroll in with some homi to ingest some greasi food befor a bout of drink they sat us a beer pong tabl that shoulda been a red flag hey fuck it were in a sport bar whatev man bring us some sandwich and beer pleas now

our order took the better part of an hour to deliv our order wasnt difficult and the place wasnt busi they dont serv ice water but instead will sell you bottl tap water with their logo on it for a dollar hey in vega everyth costs

then they bring out everyon food except for one guy his order take anoth 15 minut to come out i time it the server gave his patti melt to anoth tabl they were seat after us some guy at the tabl are done with their meal befor homi even take his first bite 

anoth one of the homi say that the bell pepper on his cheesesteak are gross and slimi and tast pickl he brought this up to the waitress an she argu that the pepper are cut fresh everi day shes a liar whi not just apolog and bring a new one san pepper argu with a custom about someth you didnt cook the fuck outta here

on top of all that the hostess allow a parti of six to play beer pong 15 tabl away from where we were eat beer pong ball kept exit their field of play and bounc under our tabl the asshol follow the ball we kick the ping pong ball into the bathroom they drank their beer with piss beer pong cool good time but not where pay custom are tri to enjoy a meal i hope they tast the piss they left after one game

if this sound like a deal for 2535 youv found your ultim sport bar and grill experience

terr i hate your gut blondiif it was possibl to take away star from other review i would seat right away 10 minut later no one had even said so much as hello i flag down hostess and let her know we havent seen a waitress 5 mi urea later waitress come by and say ill be with you in a minut a coupl minut later she final come order a coupl beer and some food cant order a glass of water they onli serv bottl really

food was averag and servic remain horribl no silverwar deliv with food ask repeat for silverwar and napkin 

if you are a local there is zero reason to ever come here if you are a tourist do yourself a favor and catch a cab to nearest pts pub you will more than save the cab ride in booz cost and get great service

plac like blondi make me feel asham after i leav like i realli should have known betterthird time a charmright

no

i took the day off from work today to get some errand done and at around 130 pm i found myself at sprout which is in the same strip mall as wahsun so i thought id give it a goagain and i was onc again let down at lunchtim on a thursday wahsun was close at least this time there was a larg close sign on the front window

i dont know how this place stay in busi i honest dont i want so bad to be abl to come back here and write a stellar review but inconsist won out a busi should adher to the busi hour postedor at least keep regular busi hour the food might be out of this world but ill never know

you lost my busi wahsun not that you ever gave me the chanc to be your custom but now i never will be

i can onli warn folk to call first befor you tri to dine here i onli live a few block away so it wasnt that big of a deal to be disappoint three time but for those who may be drawn here by the good reviewscal first and save your gasjust in casemy last visit to mm was the worst dine experi ive ever had our booth tabl was sticki and gritti on top and riddl with old dri gum on the undersid  the water that was brought to us was cloudy

worst of all was an area in the back of their dine room that is set off for prepar drink and such usual it seem it behind a partit like an offic cubicl but on this day the wall was miss and sever larg damp smelli uncov trash can were brought out and set down in the middl of the floor of the dine area where peopl were eating

then our booth seat start to come apart im not make this up it came unattach in the corner curv of the seat and start to slide out while we were sit in it

our food when it was brought out was the restaur usual qualiti i use to love their water cake most of all  cornbread serv as pancak but by this time we didnt want to stay and eat it

lat that day i found them list in recent restaur report in the good old reviewjourn the most recent one found mms with onli a few demerit and upgrad to an a the origin report a few week befor that had so mani demerit they were two point shi of immedi closur im certain that if the inspector had show up on the day i was there they wouldv been shut down right away

if i could give a zero star review i wouldwhi is this place so love weve been want to know and final tri them were from cleveland an old industri town with real soul food plus my partner cook and come from that tradit 

i order bbq chicken cornbread dress with gravi  and mac  chees my partner had fri catfish the same side plus potato salad along with chitlin sinc you cant find them easili 

first they brought out pancakestyl cornbread that tast a bit like a greas skillet  my partner entre arriv sever minut befor mine so i got a preview of my side dish  we were both surpris at the lack of season the dress was a soft gritti serv with no discern flavor other than some sage no onion salt pepper veri odd   the macaroni and chees was somewhat hard with congeal clump of chees the potato salad was more like mashedpotato salad the flavor wasnt horribl but it was most of sweet pickl 

mi bbq chicken was a huge disappoint just a small bake drumstick and thigh with bottl sauc it appear pour over them huh my partner full serv of catfish was larg devoid of season although it was cook all right the extra 4 for the third side and half a piec of fish was not worth the price 

the first bite of chitlin went into a napkin and were declar aw  im no chitlin eater the smell alon was make me gag but my partner who has both eaten and cook them couldnt stomach these 

the server was pleasant but never clear the tabl or ask how we like the food with so mani great rate mayb she didnt think it necessari to ask we wont be come back   weve done this better at home for less moneyi actual never was abl to tri the food here i got so piss at the girl take my order that i left what happen well listen to thisi decid on a sandwichi am not sure of the name  but it had roast beef and some sort of yummi chees and the other sandwich stuff they add to it well i am not a fan of veggi i know that so childish but it is what it is anyway i tell the girl what i want and i let her know i want the roast beef sandwich with onli chees and mayo no veggi she then look veri puzzl you just want chees and mayo on bread i said noi want the roast beef with just chees and mayo she then say that it doe not make ani senseso you dont want the meat i then ask herwhi would i order roast beef and then not want the meat she is like well i dont know you are the one that order it that way im like are you serious right now she then say well if you are not gonna order can you step asid so i can take the next order what  i ask to speak to the managerwho appar is the girl that has been stand next to her the whole time and did not seem to think there was a problem at all 

i was so outta therei am sure the food is yummybut it is such a shame to not onli have an employe that respond this waybut to have a person in charg think it was normalone star for the raw chicken they serv me nice pizza hut  my bad for go here i guess  hope i dont get sick from it  i take back ani good experi i may have had with them becaus of this   

they did take 50 off the meal but i was so gross out it was hard to eat anyth els and i think if you get serv raw chicken you should be comp the entir meal  sound fair to meok so it a fast food joint  how wrong can they realli go  i went in here on a tuesday afternoon around 100  there was no lunch rush happen  appar this locat has problem with peopl steal napkin and ketchup becaus there were none of the self servic station where you can load up  

the person who took my order was incred rude  there was no one in line behind me and she kept tri to make me leav her counter while i was still put my credit card away  she told me where i could stand and wait 5 time  

they pour the soda there and she had manag to cover the outsid of the cup with as much liquid as was insid  oh and ask for a napkin to clean up her messthat a big no no too

a i walk away she proceed to have a convers with anoth employe about what a bitch i was for mention the sticki cup situat  in spanish  i speak spanish   when they did toss my food at me i had to ask for ketchup and napkin  they ask how mani napkin i need i would have ask for more if i had known that everi tabl in their lobbi would be filthi  honest i probabl would have felt better about eat out back by their dumpster

fin someon did come out to clean the lobbi  instead of wipe the tabl she simpli swept up a cloud right next to me  

needless to say this had to be one of the worst burger king i have ever been tooi have been go to various red robin restaur  sinc about 1990 and have for the most part been satisfi with the food and service

today howev this was not the case this is the second time that i have been to this locat and was a littl underwhelm the first visit by the servic not the food i know this happen so decid to stop by here to satisfi a burger craving

w were seat and wait 12 minut befor we were approach by our server i was shock that she was our server becaus she had been assist the two neighbor tabl and never acknowledg us anywaysh took our drink order and return a few minut later with the drink and took our food order i order my usual  cheeseburg with bleu chees cook well the husband order the same  the ladi that deliv the food was veri nice and offer to get us ranch for our friesthat was nice of her

mi burger had a cold buni frown and thoughtwella long as the meat is cook and hot i can overlook it and it was and i dug in the husband took a bite and spit his outit was coldth bun and the burger plus it was raw insidenot a littl pinkit was raw we got our server attent after about 10 minut  she onli had 2 other tabl by the way she apolog and offer to correct the situationth new burger was deliv and was fine 

bi this time we had been out of drink for a while and realli need to quench our thirstbut our server was nowher to be found she final come overaft be prompt by us rais our handslolwhi did i rais my hand imma dork we let her know we would like some refil on our drink and some extra friesaway she goes5 minut later our fri arrivenot form herfrom anoth worker we waitedwaitedwaited20 minut have now pass we see our server offer to box the peopl food next to us she brought their check she serv anoth tabl their refil came back to the other tabl and bullshit for a few minut at this point i was piss and saw a manag and motion for him to come overexplain the ordealand he comp 50 of the billthank alex that was nice of youi wish we could have left you the tip and not her he brought us the checksh total avoid us for the rest of the time we were there

soalishayour job is to be a server this mean that you take food and drink order deliv food refil drink and make sure that we have a pleasant dine experi i know that i pride myself in my joband when i make a mistak i will be the first to admit and tri to make ammend i am not be harsh or rudethi is just basic skill that a person in this job should have i know not everyon will have a knock out personalityor huge boob or a great smile but alishacom on you could have at least apolog for the oversight

th conclus is that i will never go to this particular red robinthank to alishait would just be awkward to have to see her again i will continu to go to the one off 99th and mcdowelland then soon they will have one even closer to meooh joy 

ps the one star is for the nice manag that genuin felt bad about our experi and the nice ladi that offer the ranchwant to like this place realli realli want to 

horribl servic i mean absolut horribl 

i arriv and was start to say what a friend recommend to me but i couldnt rememb the name of it and the guy behind the counter snap and cut me off and said i hear that ten time a day well buddi sinc youv heard it befor i can understand that work in the servic industri youd not expect to hear it again sarcasm whatev i made my order and was told to go relax at a tabl well i relax for 18 minut with no food turkey blt i order and watch everyon els get their food i got up and ask if i was forgotten and there was absolut no apolog offer but said they would bring it to me 

when the guy brought over my sandwich he kind of slam it down on the tabl and walk away no apolog still no offer to refund my meal no come back later and tri us again they were just extrem rude about it i understand it happen it part of life but they act as if me not get my food was a bother to them

horr custom servic ill tell everyon i know about this stori nobodi should be abl to treat their custom like that a simpl im sorri come back and see us again for a free coffe or someth to that effect would have gone a loooooong way 

too stupid to get it probabl or mayb becaus i didnt have a rattail with a mohawk a basketbal jersey convers shoe and an obvious roid rage attitud they just didnt caremuch has chang in the two year sinc my initi review  appar nick has decid to toss custom servic out the window  i should have known it would be a problemat visit when it took near 15 minut to be acknowledg to put in our order  well it onli got wors  after near 45 minut of wait we realiz that our food was never ever go to arriv  ever  time to leav and never come back  everi realli want to like this place which is whi i came back on a sunday the barista was nice and friend that isnt so much the problem here are the problems

sorri but i wish i can say that this place is good  

horribl horribl experi note  i never rate a restaur on the first visit i rate on the second and third visit becaus there is alway a bad day

w visit this place on a busi saturday and were wait to be seat  there was staff that continu would walk by yet no one would offer help or let you know they would seat you  final we are seat and we end up wait even longer for a server to approach the tabl  there was other tabl with peopl that were have the same problem  

we order appet and they took over 35 minut to come  when the food arriv it was burn and the bruschetta look like charcoal  it was so ashi and you couldnt even eat it  the server was so lousi that our drink need refil and she would walk by multipl time and not even check in  the peopl next to us had a veri similiar situat and final we got up and i walk over to speak to a manag  

i began speak to an older man who appar was the owner  i was glad that i would be abl to give him feedback hope he would empath and be understand of our experi  instead he said  am busi right now and i dont have time to talk  i look at him amaz and i said fine then i am not pay you for your ashi bread and crappi servic  he look at me and turn his back  

i decid to come back to this place  it is the onli restaur in verrado so after a golf game we came by and i decid to clear my head and give this place anoth shot  they seat me allot faster becaus it was dead  i figur great at least this time the server should be okay sinc multitask would not be necessari  she bring us glass of water and right when i was go to take my fist drink i notic a big pink lipstick print on my glass  

i put my head down and just took a deep breath  i ask polit for anoth glass  at this point i wait again becaus either it was the onli glass in the restaur or the server was to busi do noth  

we order a chees plate forgiv me for not rememb and when it come i serious just fell off my chair  they bring over a larg plate with what look like someon empti a bag of cut bit of chees into a plate  there wasnt a differ in the chees and serious i never have seen a chees plate like that   they serv them with breadstick aka cheap wrap stick for your soup  i couldnt even eat 10 of the plate becaus there was so much chees      

on to the entre yes i stayed

i order a pizza with ham  the sauc was bad the ham was veri dri and tast rather sour  i suppos for the price i expect better but this place is just lost  i honest have never had such a bad experi at a restaur or fast food like grazi   next time i am in the middl of nowher i will starv no thank youfine we know not to expect 5star custom servic at walmart and i am a regular shopper with them but my experi at this particular store yesterday was just awful

ther were plenti of custom but almost no walmart associ to be found anywher in the store  one thing i want was an mp3 player  i final found an unfriend gal who work in that depart to ask where they were as i couldnt find them  she seem put out to have to answer a question wave her arm  said someth like theyr over there somewher  after a care look over there i return to her  annoy again she reluct agre to tri to go find some one who knew more about the small depart she work in than she did  eventu she return  remov four mp3 player from a lock cabinet near the cash regist  show them to me  scan them to determin the price  none of them were quit what i wanted

next it was over to the clean suppli of the groceri are to find a bottl of the popular cleaner clr  there wasnt ani  next it was over to the paint depart to buy a can of spray paint which was lock up  after a long search for an associ to help me there i end up back up over at electron to have miss rude page someon to paint for me  

i want a long time in paint  no one ever came so i beg the gal over in the auto repair area to help me  she came  unlock the cabinet so i could get my paint  she also help me look for my clr in hardwar  yes they carri it but they were out of it in both sizes

ther were other problem here too but you get the idea  my stay was long  not veri fruit  this walmart is rock bottom or at least it was on sunday  they brag that a cart pusher can becom general manag  well mayb that shouldnt be so     oit been a littl over a year sinc i frequent this walmart and sad it still has poor manag or is there a store manag  my shop experi today start with walk insid  not see ani of the hand basket to us for the numer but small item on my list  theyr back to have greeter so i ask the ladi where the hand basket are  she said way down at the other end of the store  whi dont they have them at both entrances

i walk down to the other end of the store where there was anoth greeter at that end tell me no we dont have those anymor  well whi not  if it made sens to have them befor what has happen  have all the custom sudden stop like them  i think not

     

521 edit  i learn today that this is not the onli valley walmart that has stop offer hand basket and i will disregard this in my star rate  a nonemploye of a secur compani that work at walmart to catch shoplift told me they are have a lot of troubl valley wide with custom run off with the hand basket so they have stop buy them at at least some store  ok but it still 1 star for other reason 

     

so move right along i went out into the area near the entranc  got a wheel shop cart but it was defect  whi is it there  whi the bad cart cull out befor open time  someon call to come fix or replac them  is this ani way to run a store  i think not

aft find a cart that would roll i went to get my first item some hair stuff i use and alway buy at walmart  rather than neat organ as at other walmart everyth was stock all willynilli with even the various brand all mix togeth  i final found the spot where my item stock but they were out of it  i have an idea  have what you carri in stock  was there sudden a rush on this one obscur item  i think not

then it was over to buy some notepad that i alway buy at walmart  i eventu found them in the wrong bin with the wrong price post at the display  is this ok  i think not

i need an outdoor thermomet  there was a sign hang up on an aisl that said thermomet but there wasnt a singl one to be found within eight feet of the sign  the area was devot to lockset  is this ok  i think not

i did find the four more item i was look for but then up at the checkout the light was on but there was no cashier  eventu someon came  check me out  is this ok  i think not

thi is so not the way to run a depart store even a discount one  whi doesnt corpor care about have this store run at even the thrifti standard that is expect at a discount chain  ugh  drive past this walmart to ani other one in the valley even my iffi one down here deep deep in the barrio say vadio at 35th av  southern     stay away i didnt want to get ani further into my review without declar my warn up close and person from start to finish my recent experi with paesano was atroci first i call to ask if they had a websit sinc i would be order a lot of food for a work event and the guy gave me a websit that doesnt exist when i told him it didnt work he rais his voic in a are you stupid tone he repeat the spell of the websit which still didnt exist so i final ask for him to fax a copi of the menu

when i place the order the next day i ask if they includ paper plate and utensil to which he repli in the same are you stupid tone uhhh whi would we do that peopl either eat in our restaur or they take the food home where they have plate and fork there  ok

when i arriv to pick up the food at 400 like i said i would no one was at the front counter  an entir five minut goe by and still no one  so i call the restaur from insid the restaur until someon came out to acknowledg me turn out to be the same gruff guy from the phone who appear to be the owner and manag  noth was readynot even the side salad he disappear and spent anoth 10 minut prepar the food which came out to extrem small portion for the price  i mean each littl ravioli cost around 2 a piec  when he went to ring me up the final kicker ensu  first he charg me for 9 entre when i order 7  when i ask him to go over the item receipt he said what you dont trust me  ummmhellono turn out i shouldnt trust you at all sinc you overcharg me for 2 invis meal  then without apolog for his mistak he rang me up again and this time charg me 100006 for my 7 meal you read that  correct  one thousand dollar  when i look at the credit card bill befor sign i point out his error and he repli no it say 100 dollar  to which i was blown away  i practic had to shove the bill in his face for him to accept his mistak  final 20 minut after i was suppos to have left i final had my over price food and paid the correct amount  the ownermanag could not have been ruder and i hope this review prevent you from face his wrath in the futurfungus mold 
expir bottl drink about to drink it 
moistur and mold on the insid of the cap
stor manag peter sung too cheap to replac it with an indat larger bottle
bottl were still on the floor as i left the store for anyon to buy
do not spend ani money here fungus moldoverpr and servic is not friend you can buy cheaper indian groceri at lee lee orient marketthis place make me realis that there is tremend busi potenti for anoth indian groceri store in the chandler area the owner hit the jackpot with the locat and that is whi they take everi liberti to dole out substandard groceri 

the expiri date is never mention on the packag and if it is it is usual wrong the other day we bought some chapati indian bread with 22nd june 09 expiri clear mark on it when we open the packet for dinner we found noth but green fungus on anoth occas we bought some solidifi pickl there have been innumer disappoint but we kept go back becaus there was no other option nearbi 

the first lesson that we learn in a market class is that the custom alway win and for now i have decid to shift my purchas to anoth store in tempi have no clue what peopl are talk about i hate this place i mean it sad for the owner but that asid this place was fuck gross 
everyth tast like nasti bean water appar onli chain smoker ate here who burnt off their tast bud my friend rave about this place so i came here 2 time the first time i threw it out after about 3 bite my friend beg me to give it a second chance

i did

sam thing

im sorri but i serious question the fresh of these ingredi 
and it was overpriced

pssorri ownersno offensfrom the poor stock shelv to the apathet staff yeah about the staff  it ok to acknowledg the custom when they thank you stare at them doesnt cut it also talk  let be frank bsing with other employe when there is a line wait for cashier assist at selfcheckout is not cool either

it might be a good polici for staff to leav cell phone in the locker while work seen the cart collector jabber away mayb this is whi there never seem to be cart onhand i have notic of late is that nobodi seem to collect cart on a regular basi when i was a teen and work groceri it was veri import that cart be collect and avail speak of cart they may wish to repair them as at least a third have lock wheels

what can you say this store is poor manag they need to train staff better too i have been go to this locat for year but find myself drive further and spend more to have a better shop experi that goe for the qualiti of produc as well

th skeevi custom dont seem to help open product and peopl make themselv at home in the lawn chair area is a big turn off be sure to check the packag for be tamper with especi the beer walk out one time with a six pack of bottl that had a few nip taken out of three of them absolut gross

hat to sound like some old man rant but i realli just need to go elsewherwhat a grimi littl corner of mill i was with a dinner parti of graduat and we were dress formallywhoev chose to come here after rula bula must not have anticip the constant stream of question grunt hey whi you dress like that wedding

th topper was be offer a shot by a group of 18yearold boy to help them out sorri ill stay here with my husband and sober contempl the aw logo andwhat that therea pole with expos nail fallen off from a wooden bench if you dare come here be sure your tetanus is up to datethis place defin the phrase first impress last a lifetim was treat so rude by the staff and the owner never go back again be care if you have a coupon they are so ridicul about accept themhad dinner with five friend here four of us arriv and had a cocktail at the bar we were seat after a 10 minut wait someon came by the tabl to greet us as soon as we were seat but we werent sure if he was the waiter or not he said bread was on the way but we didnt see it till 20 minut later and gave us some menus

w sat for near 10 minut wait for our waiter and no one show up i also want to note that the restaur wasnt too busi on a friday night perhap this review will explain whi one of my buddi ask anoth waiter for our server the same guy who greet us came back and said he was our waiter i am not go to say his name as i dont want our countri unemploy rate to go up the waiter made excus on whi he didnt come back whatever

on of my buddi whos a wine connoisseur order a 2007 syrah and the waiter brought out a 2008 instead we polit sent it back my buddi follow with anoth 2007 cabernet and we again receiv the 2008 instead how hard is it to updat the wine menu there a huge differ in wine when it come to the year how can a famous steakhous have such an oversight on the menus

al of our appet came befor we could order the wine luckili we were still drink our hous wine and cocktail we order from the bar just about when we finish our appet we got our bread realli what the point

w settl on the 2008 cabernet and had to ask for a decant the waiter didnt know what it was and later came back with one 

i order the dinner special which was 50 for a soup or salad follow by a main cours and dessert the soup was a bit salti but accept i got the filet as a main the meat was ok not great i didnt like the fact that they put sour cream and raspberri sauc on the filet if it was a good meat no sauc are necessari the best part of my meal was the dessert which was a warm bread pud 

mi other three buddi all order steak a la cart of the three steak onli one was good  ribey for the other steak which were 40 i dont think it met our expect you can certain head down the road to ruth chris or delfrisco for a similar steak i person would head back to tarbel which is also down the road

overal the meal was so so at best not worth the price the servic here was horrendi had such high hope for this place  i see them sporat all over the valley and assum they were a half decent place to get wing and a beer  i still think that but my stomach doe not  i was dissapoint with my experi here and for now am scratch ani plan on returning

i want to tri someth differ for dinner last night someth new  i didnt want fanci or to blow a lot of money just someth out of the norm  i swung by wingstop after feel like i need some chicken wing and not from wendi  lol  so i end up here

i walk in and the place isnt huge but seat quit a few  studi the menu ask a few question and end up order the 3 peic chicken wing combo for a reason price  i went with the bbq flavor

so the food come out like 10 minut later  i couldnt even finish it  the fri were so salti and tast weirdthey were spici i think  my toungu didnt know what to do  the wing were dous in bbq sauc  i mean buri   it was like they went to wendi or mcdonald got some bbq sauc and pour it over the top of the wing and walabbq chicken wing  it was just to much for me to finish  it was to much with the sauc  even after i scrape some off i still couldnt down the rest  

mi stomach gurgl the rest of the night  it didnt like what i fed it  i woke up in the middl of the night want to hurl but end up not do so thank good  it was to much for my tummi to handl

needless to say i realli dont appreci be treat like trash and will never be come back here again if you want ethiopian food id recommend the blue nile cafe in temp better menu select delici food pleasant staff and compar pricetina need to get a dose of realiti after i was harass and verbal abus for leav a negat review tina respond to it as well my origin review note to to you tina our groupon was not expir so im not sure what your rant was about in ani case i was realli hope this aw experi will be just left alon but it seem like tina and her worker cant get pass the realiti of the situat and the fact that there may be some custom who enjoy the disgust atmospher and undercook and cold food but there are also mani like me who didnt enjoy anyth about this so call restaur and will never go back newsflash to you tinacothi is no way to conduct busi and it never be accept here in the us if these abus tactic work in ethiopia they certain do not here and will get you busi shut down sooner than you can send anoth nasti email i actual feel sorri for you bc you seem to have fool a lot of peopl with your what it seem to be a veri bipolar attitud if you ever contact me again whether is by send me anoth unaccept and harass email or by respond in an abus way i will contact a few of the author that might want to look into your busi health dept the polic in addit to contact some tv stationsbeliev me this will be a good stori for them you are lucki i havent done this yet bc make no mistak i am relentless if i want to get someth donethis is not cafe lalibela or even close i was so excit to have ethiopian food so close i grab a take out sampler to go no one was in there and when i got home i threw away most of it becaus of a bad smell i am no stranger to ethiopian food and this was realli not goodboil down i found someth i want on their site but went to the store to look at it in person and to brows around

when i got there i notic that the price onlin was lower than instor  and confirm it via my phone

i ask the cashier nice and they refus to pricematch two whole buck so i ask to see the manag who was mindblow rude and unhelp no apolog offer  total the opposit  and she essenti said they wont price match the web and they have lower price on their site becaus they goug you with ship and handl fee etc super bitchi about it all so i left and spent my money elsewhere

aft about a month coolingoff period i final wrote cost plus home offic about that horribl manag person plus to suggest that they say someth on their site like home depot etc do inform custom that instor price may not be the same yadda 

never heard anyth back from them at all conclus they could not care less also know that this is a store i have been go to sinc i was a littl kid  theyr from the bay area therefor ill never set foot in cost plus again and hope to enlighten other about their crappi busi practic p it not about the two dollar  it about the total disrespect for their customers

especi in this economi good servic is so import as is fair priceso not follow my own advic ahem never return i return here for a friend birthday dinner a few month ago i super love this person so how could i say no ha big mistak also fair warn there are severalacapslock ahead

th onli pleasant thing about the even was the reserv and seat were right on time for our larg group 15 peopl and of cours becaus we were celebr a super special person

il keep this updat short and sweet

3 for a can of soda get real i knew itd be overpr but i was at least expect a mini bottl or someth but a can come on you bought that in bulk and paid 03342 cent for it fail

your server idiot first it take our server 15 minut to come around the first time and take drink order then shes back anoth 15 minut after that take the order again did you forget were you not pay attent the first time we around whi did it take 30 minut just to order drink and on top of that we wait anoth 15 to receiv them fortyf minut to receiv drink is bad veri veri bad 

also not take food order until after weve been seat for one hour is bad veri veri bad seat at 8 oclock we didnt receiv our food until almost ten oclock two hour for food is veri veri bad do you hear that st franci bad

drov back homeshitti littl chines place usual have alright food not this place noth we tri even tast good a real emphasi on shitti order tofu sweet and sour chicken and egg roll as well as hous lo mein i think it was the oil becaus everyth sort of tast rancid and was serious greasi also the shrimp in the hous lo mein didnt smell veri good so i pick it out still the greasi noodl didnt sit well with me or my friend she end up get sick right afterward though i was fine 

i am convinc that there is zero decent chines in surpris perhap there is anoth place i should check outhow the hell you gonna trust a place to be authent when they dont even know the differ between parmesan and parmagiana so they just combin them into a made up word what the hell is parmasana

parmagiana is a style of cook parmesan is the chees you sprinkl on your spaghetti

god peopl can be so stupidlook to expand my list of healthi food store as i continu on my healthi food plan i went out of my way to this market on ray and dobson  i had most good experi at the sprout in phoenix that i use to go to so although i knew the price overal were higher than sunflow i thought a littl varieti is good

i would not recommend this sprout to my friend and famili  

they short bag my order and left out vitamin and then did not want to replac the item or give me my money back they interrog me and made me feel like a crimin i didnt even want to tell him about the bust chalula and my foot be hurt by their bag  they final did replac the miss item but onli after make me cri and keep me from use my phone and take my driver licens  i felt threaten and unsafe

 i would say if you go there doubl check and make sure all your bag get in your cart ask for doubl bag and if they short your order go back with a big guy as a bodi guard or someth  they are scari there and they do not take complaint well

prob better to avoid them all togeth  as for me i will never return  i made a complaint to their corpor offic but not let myself in for such treatment againdo you ever think that your on punkd or on that abc show what would you do with john quinones

 i was hope to god me and my inlaw were on that show that would have explain whi our experi at sylvia was so horrific

i was silent pray that a pseudo celebr or the great john q himself would come out of the kitchen with sever camera and a boom mic to get our surpris reaction to the aw food and the restaur terribl manager

they should be thank for the custom that keep their busi openso where do i start

cam here 2 night ago with a bunch of guy of course
they all had beer me on the other hand well i dont drink which lead to me to review on the food and service

i order one of their wrap it took over 30 min to arriv after place my order whi did it take that long to get to me my friend said they mess up on my order oh and the worst part after the long wait it didnt have ani flavor and the tast was horribl i had wedg with my wrap and that was decent 

i suggest onli come here if your a guy look for a casual sport bar to have drink with friend and dont order ani of the food item my other friend order a chicken sandwich and it look realli scari he didnt want to eat it but he was realli hungri  my other friend order the nacho from my view it look realli cheap and horribl no good qualiti here when it come to food

park wasnt a problem seat wasnt a problem veri casual 

i would never be caught in a bww again first and last visit for me cant believ i spent 2 hour in here yuck

nextugh ghetto 0 star if i could

how doe a place like this stay open 

i mean it outrag priceddirti as hell  produc  meat is poor qualiti and it is locat in the scruviest place with more homeless peopl harass you in the park lot  than anywher ive ever been in las vegas

th von gas station ain t bad but for groceri there an albertson or smith down the streetvon is part of safeway year ago safeway went out to remodel their store tear out flouresc strip light switch to moodspot light like a depart store redesign the bakeri deli and produc area ad starbuck concess and well fargo bank branch insid and rais price and tri to rais qualiti and introduc their own o brand no not oprah but organ to compet with whole paycheck er i mean whole food and get higher margin sale or loyal custom with the safeway club card for big discount off the inflat price 

most everi california safeway has gone through this transform but von and nevada are a littl behind 

there are two ghetto von in the east side of las vega pretti close to each other just off the maryland blvd this one on twain has been remodel finally

but unfortun they couldnt remodel the riff raff client and the remodel isnt the same becaus this place doesnt have the volum of well heel custom like the suburban summerlin and henderson locat so the shelv are half empti 

but you can find about 6 scooter chair here to shop around in and a bank of slot machin to idl away your time and loos chang or pocket money and the slot machin chang guy is easier to find than anoth checker to open up a new line after 10 peopl are wait in onli one

th other ghetto von hasnt finish remodel yet it is a mess so it is a step down for a store but the peopl who frequent it are a slight step upi got to tell the truth here and to be brutal honest i realli realli want to like this place lino had so much potenti and most all the qualiti i truli appreci in a local italian eateri let go down the check list shall we 

famili ownedcheck
10 or so tabl hole in the wallcheck
not far from homecheck
reason pricedcheck
foodabsolut god awful

now you may think im be a littl harsh but trust me peopl the food was so profound horribl i just cant hold back  i have a moral and cultur oblig to share my less than 1 star dine experi  i order the manicotti a ricotta stuf larg ziti style noodl with chees and sauc not a hard concept to grasp right well appar it was for lino  i guess when i ask for manicotti he thought i request a disgust chees crape smother in a discount sauc  this place suck and i hope next time i drive by there board on the window with a giant sign that read closefirst off i need to express that this place had some of the best servic ever and this 1 star is for the food alon as well as the price even if it was gift if i had to pay i would cri  yike i believ that a restaur has to have good food and good servic for me to be a repeat custom and this place is a big do not want for me as far as the food goe 

went here last night with a big parti for my boyfriend cousin graduat i notic quick that onli the side were vegetarian obvious this is a steak hous but after talk to the waiter he said that they could make a veget plate for me i had high hope sinc the last time this happen at todd who also lack vegetarian entre and the food was spectacular i also thought that sinc this place was as pricey as it was anyth i put in my mouth would be orgasm unfortun everi singl thing was bland as all getout 

first off i tri the bread which look great but they do not provid proper bread knive so the big fluffi bread end up be smush it was also ridicul flaki make a big mess and just didnt tast that great 

mi veget plate came and that exact what it was it was liter giant veget just steam  no herb no flavor no spice  noth total disappoint there was broccoli a halv tomato asparagus cook spinach and portobello mushroom which was the best part as those kind of mushroom pack a lot of flavor by themselv it was a huge plate but there was no punch 

i tri some of the side the pankoencrust onion ring and the mash potato both were also almost flavorless but still kind of decent but no way were they worth 10 each absolut ridicul price for someth so veri plain 

the boyfriend and i share a chocol souffl for dessert which look great but was kind of disgust it was a hot chocol sludgi mess the best part was the cream on the side not someth i would order again 

i was veri disappoint with this restaur the absolut impecc servic howev could not make up for the aw food the meat eater at the tabl seem happi with what they receiv but i was just in awe at how bland everyth was 

servic 55
ambianc 55
price 15 just yike when my boyfriend said it was 43 for his itti bitti filet mignon i almost choked
food 05 

i realli realli want to give this place a chanc but if your a vegetarian who has tast bud stay far far awaycame to morton for restaur week the price was 5013 per person and they had a special menu where you could pick between a coupl differ thing we start out with a larg loaf of onion bread the bread wasnt bad but i could onli eat so much next came the french onion soup i could have pick up and drank it in 3 gulp it was so small the soup had a veri bland flavor then my steak and side came the filet was cook the way i ask and didnt tast bad but certain isnt worth what they are charg i have had better steak at high end steakhous on the strip the side i share with my wife we had the sour cream mash potato and lyonnais potato the mash was not bad but the lyonnais potaot were just gross the onion were veri overcook and chewi the potato werent at all what my wife show me in other pictur on yelp then came dessert i chose the strawberri cheesecak and it couldnt have been anymor flavorless the portion for restaur week were way smaller then if you just came in and order from their regular menu which is a scam to me the food just wasnt good and a wast of money

our server was veri good he check on us often one of the server mention that morton was undergo a remodel and said we were lucki to be seat in a booth in the corner becaus then we wouldnt be bother by dust like some other custom you should never ever talk about that with peopl about to eat in your restaur  

the park suck the front of the restaur is reserv for valet onli all other patron must park behind the restaur and walk around not veri classithis store is down right stinki the smell i endur on my last and final visit was enough to make me run and stick my face in a bowl of rotten egg to mask it 

this store is veri old and is in need of a serious remodel or just do me a favor and close it so i dont have a moment of insan and walk up in here again 

the surround locat is bad as they alway have an employe stand at the door to prevent theft and grab and run thiev 

their food is not fresh i bought a bag of chip o hoy chocol chip cooki and they were month expir and hard as a rock i never realli thought about check expir date sinc i guess i was safe in assum the store was on top of that boy was i wrong when i return them to the store so i could issu my complaint the clerk act as if this was a common occurr wowzers

also they had a major frozen dinner sale awhil back to clear out almost expir and some question item that frozen section smell rank and i was just offend and insult at the same time

th onli redeem factor is that the staff is friend as they do have a good crew 

i just dont have that oh it smell so clean and fresh let buy groceri feel when here instead it make me want to flip a b and leav thank that i have a shower at my hous it make me thank for have a work toilet it make me thank for have a wash machin it make me thank for that cute littl rose pink bar of soap on my bathroom sink 

i have put myself through miseri for the last mfg timedid you ever hear the expressiongon to hell in a hand basket

i cant believ that i got drag here a second time never againmade a reserv for my first time tri this place  want to go have a nice dinner with my boyfriend for our date night  arriv earli and was extrem underwhelm with the decorinterior  the hostess immedi explain that due to a larg walk in parti i would not be abl to be seat on time  she then walk me to the bar and said when our server are avail then we will seat you at a tabl  ok so we sit at the bar and order martini which were veri overpr consid this is in a strip mall off the strip 13 we sit and wait for over 20 minut befor decid that this is ridicul and discuss where we should go instead sinc we want to catch a show we alreadi bought ticket for  the bartend overhear and then grab the hostess and she tri to convinc us to stay but then promis that our food wont be readi in time for our movi but we should stay anyway  what a joke  horribl first impress unimpress servic and overpr  i will not be give them a second chanci never thought i would write a review of a mcdonald much less have to write a negat review for a mcdonald i dont even know how it possibl that a mcdonald could be so bad but unfortun this one is   

like mani peopl i have eaten at mcdonald all over america and even in sever other countri  i have to say this is probabl one of the worst mcdonald ive ever been to other than the one in manila in the philippin and that onli becaus im not sure that what was in those burger was even beef

wher do i begin the servic is terribl i have never not one time gotten what i order i get sweet tea when i ask for unsweeten i get chees when i ask for none i get onion when i ask for none i get 2 chicken sandwich when i ask for 4 appl pie  i have given up on go through the drive thru becaus i alway end up have to pull around park go in and wait in the long line of teenag get shake  just to get them to correct my order and even then they dont get it right and i actual have to tell them no see this is a chicken sandwich i order a mcdouble

th food is almost alway cold the burger are dri and tast like they have been sit on a shelf for more than an hour and the frysugh when there are 6 car in the drive thru and 20 peopl in line i just dont understand how the frys can be cold and stale it absolut defi logic 

ye there are time that the food come out hot it one of the reason i keep go back there noth like hot frys from mcdonald and also just becaus it mcdonald like it or not it a stapl for work parent too tire to cook dinner after work some night it is unfortun that they have no competit in the immedi area to keep them on their toe otherwis they might actual tri to improv their servic and their product i am sure they are turn a profit no doubt it seem to alway be busi howev i truli believ that if ani other burger joint open up right next door this place would close down in a month everi time i say im never go back i still do unfortun tonight will be one of those night as the kid specif request it the shear dread of what im about to go through is what prompt this review  

i realli hope they improv it hurt to have to knock a mcdonaldthe most horribl experi i have ever had ever so i order a pizza with pepperoni and artichok and the ladi say it will take about an hour i said ok she took all my info includ my address and cross street after an hour and a half of wait i call them back wonder is the driver got lost or whatev no she assur me he was on his way and they just got a littl behind ok no prob two hour later my pizza is deliv the guy say to me as i open the door that i call the wrong angelina and that there was a closer one to me i said oh bc the ladi who i order from said noth about that then he proceed to tell me that he was late bc it took him forev to find this place sinc it so out of the way what the eff 

i took my pizza and hope that despit wait 2 hour and listen to someon tell me im an idiot for order from the wrong pizza place i thought that the food would make up for it no horribl cold not melt chees with a total of 10 slice i count sinc i was piss and a few artichok heartsthrown onto this larg pizza i becam irat 

this was serious the worst pizza ive ever had with the worst servic ill never ever ever ever go here again and neither should you  oh and it was 22 for a crappi pizza lamewow shthole and a half

on wednesday night a few of us coupl head on over to this place for a date night meal  when we walk in we were seat right away howev it summer in vega and even befor they turn on our grill it was scorch hot in there  

a waitress come over and we start to order after place two order of five all of a sudden without warn or a word said the waitress just walk away from our tabl  wtf

then anoth waitress walk over and we tell her what just happen and she say oh shes new  as if that somehow excus that sort of behavior  then she proceed to take our order and tell us even though there are five of us we can onli order two item at a time  bullsht  the menu said four item at a time and i quick told her nope sorri two isnt enoughw want four like the menu say at which time she say ok and proceed to take our order

then when she come back with our drink all of a sudden the two drink we had previous order from the runaway waitress appear  shes confus were confusedit all confusing

then the food start come out  the first round we order was great and we proceed to enjoy that round  howev on the second round of meat we order we order pork but it shouldv been call pork fat becaus that all it was fat  how they even had the face to serv such a mess ill never know  we end up leav it there becaus it was ined  

dure the second round of meat we also order a refil of salad and of the pancak  the salad never came even though we ask for it two addit time  and for the pancak though they are open suppos until 2am at 930pm they ran out

th bill came and it was approx 40 a person with tax and drink  

i have never been to a restaur with such poor servic and attent to detail  eat out is suppos to be a pleasur and an opportun to relax and enjoy not a hassl like our experi here was  

there are a ton of other korean bbqs in vega and i definit do not recommend this onecame here again tonight with friend with a 25 restaurantcom coupon must spend 35 not includ 18 percent gratuity

thi time the food was crappi 

we watch him microwav the chicken strip yuck

th garlic knot had no garlic what so ever

th pizza was not as good as last time lift the pizza the sauc and all the chees fell off leav us all with flimsi crust no bueno it was not good at all it was sad when my 2 year old is a huge pizza fan took one bite and put it back

w all decid 6 of us that we wont be back againdump

i was scare for my life you would be hard press to find a place more scari and sketchi in las vegas

i had fun play bingo but when we were leav i thought i was go to get shot as a polic situat and manhunt was unfold in the casino as i walk out the door i see two guy urin in the bush and one vomit just step from the polic car 

mi first time play bingo sinc i was a kid if i have to deal with this scene no thankdude ive been to lucki cheng in nyc sever time so when my friend decid that she want to see her first ever drag show and we were in vega i thought it was a great idea to bring her here

ther was a 2fer special which we paid for in advanc on their websit this is import inform for later in the stori so my friend and i as a last huzzah got all dress up and arriv and we wonder if we were in the right place

gr it was a wednesday night but this is vega right parti all the time i guess not becaus there was bare anyon here it was me and my friend a scare look coupl and a rowdi bunch of account that it 

we came in and got some drink not cheap peopl and wait for our meal and wait and wait after liter 1 12 hour we got our food i am not sure what they were do becaus it wasnt a pack hous mayb they were make everyth from scratch not so much becaus the food wasnt memorable

th show was rowdier than in nyc and the ladi were veri nice but the servic was haphazard at best 

the kicker of the night was when we were leav all of a sudden we hear a squeaki voic yell excus me excus me and a teeter queen chase us down the park lot here we thought we forgot someth instead shes like i think you made a mistak with the check  there onli 12 here we were like no we prepaid  that your tip and come to think of it it was a generous one at that 

so my experi at lucki cheng las vega was subpar at best i dont recommend this place  if your look for a show there are better on the striphmmm  am lower your star until i understand what go on

best staff is gone  not pay rent    what give  the restaur has been close for daysredtag 

whi what happen  new execut chef an ass  owner gambling
im just sayin you had a boom busi a decent locat commit loyal great yelp review but youv let it go to hellegad  as local we go to joe 56 time a year for pleasur and busi usual the food and servic is outstand last night for christma dinner it was horrend on both front we made reserv about a week in advanc  they call us that morn to confirm  then told us they could not find our reserv on the phone  when we arriv they told my wife they could not find the reserv when my wife offer to show the confirm number on her mobil phone the host say let me do my job  after 3 minut he then ask to see the confirm number  we final get seat and it get worse

w order dinner drink and appet  25 minut after take our order we are inform that the whole main lobster is no longer avail we had order 2  we then reorder lobster tail and chiliean sea bass  when the food arriv our side dish are miss  one lobster tail was overcook one undercook and the seabass was bland  the side final arriv more than midway through our entre  the waitress apolog and say the side will be taken off the bill  we had also ask for refil on the bread  three time which final arriv when the plate are cleared

th manag come over and act annoy that he has to apolog for the servic and food  natur when the bill come the side are not taken off   we were so bother by the lack of concern we paid the bill and left  it will be awhil befor we return to joethis is for the restaur portion of mix dont be fool by the 4 star review for mix the loung youll hate it

i cant help but rate 1 with the terribl servic we receiv at the restaur last weekend

w went to vega for uncorkd but becaus my 30th birthday had just pass we want to do an intim dinner with close friend part of whi we chose to stay at thehotel at mandalay was becaus we knew we want to have dinner at mix the view were gorgeous and the interior was just right up my alley

when we made reserv for the hotel we also made reserv for mix so it was well in advanc close to 3 week at that time we were not ask if we want to sit outsid we didnt even know there was outdoor seat for dinner i thought that was onli part of the loung area

first mistak was sit us outsid without ask if it was ok till later in the even it was a littl hot for 8pm but we figur with the view and the soon to be order drink it would be fine we didnt think wed be there for 25 hour anyway

30 minut pass and all we have so far is water and a menu the waiter i believ his name was luka final come with the drink and wine menu along with the special he was actual pretti knowledg about the food so that was probabl the first and onli good sign

h come back to take our order 15 minut later  still with onli water we ask for bread awesom we have to ask for our own bread when it obvious the tabl around us have bread and drink at this point no one even want to drink becaus the moment has pass were 45 minut into the dinner with water and a menu wtf it not even busy

so we order 

and then we wait and wait and wait and laugh about wait becaus it just so ridiculous

ov an hour into our 8pm reserv we have a glass of water with no ice in warm summer night a coupl cocktail becaus the servic somehow manag to take away our fun spirit and were a rowdi but classi bunch and some bread

oh but you know who had fun the waiter sure did this mother fn waiter sure was chat it up with some ladi behind us we saw the water guy more than him

clos to 2 hour we manag to swoop up a bus boy to ask about our food he say hell check with our waiter and a few minut later our food come out did we just have to remind the bus boy to remind the waiter that he has a tabl to serv dont you watch top chef dont you know the chef are bustin their chop to get the food fire up

our food was luke warm  not hot  which leav me to believ some dish were sit out while this jerk flirt with the ladi who by the way were not all that i aint mad at the cougar though

bi the end of the meal  we dont even want whatev the heck it is they do for birthday  we just ask for the check he then said are you sure you dont wanna see the dessert menu we all kinda said no no no at the same time want to get the fck outta there and then he said ill bring you out someth anyway on the hous for the troubl  he then bring out this crap that we saw him serv to everyon around us so no your not sorri at all

you just want your 100 mandatori gratuiti for a parti of 8 that you didnt actual wait on and instead dodg our tabl for over 2 hour while the bus boy serv us water

w talk to the manag afterward look for a sincer apolog and instead he decid to blame us for not seek him dure dinner wtf whi dont you get off your lazi ahol and ask if your tabl are do ok if your waiter arent do the job

seri this was the worst birthday experi myself and friend have ever had to endur 

and the wors part was that this guy got 100 tip i would have rather gave that to the guy serv us water all night long

oh and the food fish was overcook which suck becaus it was the sea bass which appar has been on the menu sinc day one but becaus it was probabl sit out for 30 minut probabl over cook the filet were good noth amaz 

sad sad sad we were defeat that night and had to head back to the room and ralli up some cocktails

th onli good thing about this night was that it was our first night in vega and made us make sure the rest of the trip was ahol free well done mixwow where to start 

we were on a littl vacat with our famili at lake las vega we are local who live in south west las vega we decid to visit the villag and happen upon this place it is a beauti littl restaur sit on the lake

our whole experi was so incred insult i bare have the word  to describ it we were quit liter treat like second class citizen we have 3 children that were with us they are well behav and were not make a scene we were place on the patio off to the side  there was one gentleman who seat after us and he must have been a movi star becaus he quit liter get a massag from all of the server there were 2 obvious well off gentlemen sit out near us you would have thought we had the bubon plagu nobodi ask us how our meal was our server was an accent ladi who was incred rude odd she got nice when tip time came 

at one point an older guy with a beard came out i am guess he was the owner he never made eye contact with us and made a point of say hi to mr movi star on the patio and 2 other gentlemen sit near us he had to walk around us to get to those 2 guy the whole experi was so insult that the qualiti of the food doe not realli matter

i order the bone in filet at 38 i paid 2 extra to have a bake potato instead of the mash it came with it was an impress cut of meat i order it medium and it came well done my bake potato was over cooked

on thing to note is that mr movi star on the patio order a bone in ribey and my wife said that it look magazin qualiti when he cut into it so if your someon import they cook your food good 

mi wife got the bone in rib eye she order it medium and it came well done 

mi son order crab cake they were pretti good 

so the moral of the stori is this if you have money or you like snooti restaur where they treat you like crap than this is the place for you if you like the combin of good food and good servic than eat elsewheras i have note in other review i am a recent transplant from venic beach ca and have decid to dive right into the scene

in la there are ton of wonder ethiopian restaur to choos from so i have been check out what las vega has to offer  i began my journey at meskerem last week see my review and decid to check this place out 

i read a post  dont think it was on yelp that said that cottag cafe was better than the spot in littl ethiopia in la that a bold statement needless to say i had to see what the hot fuss was about

i call my order in as i know that ethiopian joint can some time have servic that is ssssllllllooooowwwww i place an order for the vegetarian combin and the lamb stew an order like this from most ethiopian restaur is typic enough food for me to make into about 6 meal perfect as i do not want to cook in 105 degre weather 

the first woman who answer had to get someon els to take my order as she could not understand the simpl phrase id like to place an order to go anyway i order with a bit of apprehens and proceed to head over think that sure my food would be readi by the time i got there i live in green valley and the restaur is around the corner from unlv you would think that that would be enough time

of cours there were no custom in the place when i got there about 9 pm on a thursday night and the chick behind the bar look put out to have a pay custom walk in the door when i said that i was there to pick up my order one frown up at me and ask what it was and proceed to write out the ticket and take it back to the kitchen hello the point of call it in was so that it would be place and readi for me to pick up the other chick never said a word and just disappear into the back somewher wow

aft stand at the bar and watch an episod of real housew of ny on their big screen tv i final got my order long stori short for 23 buck i was expect more food more flavor and some form of servic  a simpl hello would have been nice

when i got home i was pretti disappoint the portion of veggi were way smaller than i am accustom to and the lamb was way dri unlik one review i know it was definit lamb not dog or cat meat like he saidte hee hee  but the bone to meat ratio was pretti high and i had to add my own ethiopian spice to it 

dont know how anyon could give this place more than 1 star but i would avoid this place at all cost  never again will i return for the first time in my life i am not look forward to the left over ethiopian chill in my fridg be tipsi help it go down okay last night might have to tri that again for the remaindthis one star is for all starbuck in vega and possibl all of nv  

mi friend and i had two etho water profit support a children chariti  i ask the barista to pleas thrown the empti into the recycl bin that i assum was in the back  she said oh we dont recycl  she went on to explain that it cost companiesindividu in the area extra to have recycl pick up so most peopl dont do it  i was shock that starbuck wouldnt foot the bill for this  i phone the headquart yes i had time on my hand and they concur that this is standard practic in mani areawow what a disast today was
first off you walk in and it is overwhelm warm

w order i had the asiago roast beef with tomato soup and a baguette
mi aunt had a turkey sandwich but she ask them told hold the onion and instead of the chipotl mayo if they could substitut it for regular mayosh doesnt do spici veri well and order a bag of chip with her lunch

w find a place to sit and our plate come
th chip and the baguett werent on the right plate but okay i guess that an easi switch

but you could clear see the huge slice of red onion and the huge glob of chipotl mayo on my aunt sandwich she take it up to the counter to have it remade

im sit with my daughter and befor i take a bite out of my sandwich i see a stand of plastic wrap hang out of it it is veri notic and i am begin to wonder how no one saw iti then take my plate up to be remade

th manag inform me that it was from the cheese

girlfriend i do not care where it is from i dont want it in my sandwich
sh came by with our new plate afterward and offer us a free cooki but we declined

th food was ok the soup was the savior of it all for me
yikthis is consist the slowest and worst custom servic of all the 50 locat ive been too anyon who follow my checkin know i cant start my day without a coffe i also travel quit a bit for mani reason so i have been to more than my fair share of coffe hous around the world i hate to say it but the servic at this locat would be rate the veri worst of them all the drive thru is ridicul slow there is alway at least 2 or 3 car and take about the same amount of time as 6 the staff ignor you when you walk up to the regist half the time while they talk about their weekend or shift or whatev i could go on and on 

but the coffe is still a good starbuck coffe like im use to there still free wifi it close to my hous and has outdoor seat so for those reason i keep come back i just know i have to have a lot of extra patienc on those dayupon my last visit ewww all i can say is ewwww
thes peopl at this locat oh lord babi honey child they just give you cold fri and old stale chicken nugget they was hard like littl rock the soda was miss soda or someth it was sour i wont ever go back to this locat it smell funni and they look all shock when i ask for my money back the outsid of the bag was all wet and sticki ewwww thank good i carri hand sanitoh what a differ a year make one year ago i love penn thai hous the awesom jaim w recommend this place and she was right in recommend them penn was good so good that i went outsid of my comfort zone to tri differ textur and flavor that i never thought id tri lunch dinner persuad my famili to pay a bit more and give them a tri i had penn at 5 star and show my support with my feet walk in the door and spend 50 minimum on my night order and give 25 tip for lunch

that was then the love i had for penn has been crush i visit about 2 month ago hope to rekindl the love and happi thai food experi i miss instead the food made my famili sick and my sister in law said never again i would pass over sunset on the 95 and look over at the green neon at nightand wish for the old day 

then came word of penn make it onto the dread channel 13 dirti dine segment i read the stori snhd said penn hire a top food safeti expert to clean them up i found myself crave good spici thaiand through strang circumst i found myself with 45 minut to spare and im 3 block away off i wentwould i be abl to find happi again had the expert done his job this is vega sometim you gotta take a chance

th build is the same but the soulless lunch plate of chili mint chicken and bore egg roll and circa 1980 school cafeteria grade egg drop soup left no doubt in my mind that the penn i love was gone tack on the extra 1 for use a debit card under 10 and servic that was cold and aloof and when i walk out the door i said i was done i believ in redempt and give second chanc penn got that opportunityand they blew it 

when it was good it warrant placement on my mythic 6th star list now it just a wast of commerci space 

better altern are less than 15 minut away you would be better off to use the yelp app and find them 1 star under protestwhat a shamethe mr want enchilada we were in the area i agre to tri this place out neither of us had ever been

h proceed to order chees enchilada with no onion and is told everyth is premad with onionswtf 
i want to leav but he decid to tri the fajita i got a tostada and tortilla soup not even pictur worthi tast like premad crap and la victoria can beans

so let just play a fun game with the name here

sound like garcias

barfcias
grosscias
diarrheas

i think you get the picturei would not recommend go heredear god i rather have noodl with drink water than eat here again the servic was horribl and the food was 110 crap the pho was tasteless the rice plate was not tasti and everyth els was dull there was noth asian or american about this place for a restaur in treasur island i expect way better 

let me start off with their servic the host was a veri good one she act like the place was pack and took her precious seat us downwhich took 10 minut after we sat down the waiter didnt come by for anoth 10 or so minut but there cleanup boy took our drink order what the heck let me tell you they onli had 3 waitress and they werent the quickest one out there of cours they were probabl age 50 and over but that okay i like them old 

after we order our food it took them over 20 minut to get a bowl of not so great look pho and a disturb put togeth rice plate to my tabl not onli the food took forev to come out they got my pho order all wrong i serious didnt think it could get ani worst but it did 

the waitress took forev to just get our bill i mean serious what was she do or what were they do where are all the littl old waitress im not give them a hard time i smile when they came i ask nice when i need thing but this is just too much 

mi 20 minut lunch time meal turn out to be an hour or so a total wast of time and money if you are plan to go eat here this place should get more fast pace move waiter and a better chef 

i had a horribl experiyike i have been wait on submit this review sinc i just could not find the right word for this place like si said earlier this is not my typic scene i am uncomfort in bar general i am cri into my heinous overpr poor mix drink in the corner but that is not relev to this review at all pfff

i am not cool enough to understand whi peopl like this place or whi it is cool this has to be one of the smallest danc club ever construct are these cramp quarter good  so that someon is guarante to unknow grab your ass at some point in the even also the layout for the place with two differ mix of hous music permeat both floor is obnoxi it truli feel like the cool peep are dri hump each other upstair and the notsogreat peep are downstair wish they were upstair 

the cover was 7 wtf i can think of million of differ thing i could spend my cash on but dont relax just yet we havent even explor the deplor cost of drink this must be the place that paul rudd was refer to in 40 year old virgin when he state yeah it is 9 beer night 7 for a gin and tonic that freak cocktail serv us i love the fact that becaus i wasnt danc vigor or did not have huge fake breast that it took him like 12 minut to figur out we were there 

this place is horribl the ice is the fact that these huge bouncer plop themselv triumphant in everi corner just wait for the chanc to push scrawni punk out of the way

i am so annoy with this experi even a few day later i dont think i will be back here not even to order togo which i couldnt even find a togo menu and even tri to ask for one was a hassl archi you realli let me down this past sunday i hope your manag read this and put you into place i dont expect topnotch servic and someon alway at my tabl but i do expect a smile and atleast a littl servic when dine outmy friend and i took a short trip to vega for the food and entertain  we visit sever restaur with either famous chef or great review and for some reason cannot rememb who recommend it we also went to zeffirino one night for dinner

i arriv slight earli than everyon els and was ignor by the maitr as i stood in front of her instead she walk to a small group of peopl eye the restaur as they walk through the grand canal shop and start talk to them  eventu after mayb 1015 min i decid to enter on my own and sat down at the bar for a drink  the maitr did not becom more effect after my friend arriv and our group of 7 or 8 i cant rememb was sat at a 5 men booth while there be onli two other occupi tabl in the whole restaur  we mention the seat be too cozi and was not acknowledged

aft most of our drink were serv it took anoth 8 request for my friend hot water to reach the tabl for her tea bag  meanwhil we realiz that the menu was rather limit with plain pastamarinara sauc be around 20  the disast is just about to begin  as a group we order 6 appet 3 salad and 6 entre to share but it was obvious that the staff at the restaur felt that we were cheap for not order enough and their attitud was absolut horribl  first it was the overcook duck that the manag insist is done medium rare

manag  we do not and will not ever serv duck cook more than medium rare
us so how would you call this show him the meat
manag that is definit more than welldone
us and we ask for medium rare
manag but we do not and will not ever serv duck cook more than medium rare
us er

asid from the teahotwat problem and the duckproblem we seem unabl to get the wait staff to provid us with the correct number of utensil throughout the whole meal  although they were not busi at all with onli two other tabl be occupi in the restaur they had extrem difficulti be us 7 but not 4 fork and 7 but not 5 knife  the servic was simpli offensive

al in all it was a horribl experi not a singl dish was memor  the steak was averag all the pasta were at diner level even oliv garden make better stuff the salad were noth more than what you can get at a colleg din hall and the appet were so not interest i cant recal a singl thing about them

dont goworst place ever their nasti karaok singer who is a regular physic assault my brotherinlaw and the bartend did not care there was no manag or owner on staff this place is manag horribl and i do not recommend it to anyonim updat my review due to the extrem rude manag on duti on easter 

i place an order for pick up earli on sunday to have pick up at two i order four meal and sever pastri from the case when i was check out i mention that i was to get a side and bagel option with the benedict i order per their menu onlinese pictur two girl told me no befor they ask the manag jeremyjerri who said no but go a head and give it to her i said thank you he proceed to get a menu to point it out i said ok just to let you know your menu onlin say that all egg and omelet dish come with a choic of side state and a bagel all in the same section of the benedict he said it come with an english muffin but im not go to make a big deal out of a bagel and that hes never had anyon ask for the bagel i dont respond becaus i know better and he agre to give me the bagel but i think to myself well i understand that a benedict come with an english muffin im not stupid but the menu didnt state a bagel for a substitut the girl ring me out said oh the onlin menu well what this guy doesnt know is that ive work in and manag place veri similar to this and i know when a cashier is sympath with a custom they obvious have had this complaint befor also by the way he immedi got defens 

so i pay 75 and tip not to mention the 825 for a larg side of fruit that was a mere pint and we leav as were walk out the door i hear maam like ive forgotten a bag ha nope it the manag come outsid to argu some more my bf said after we left that when he came out the manag said i didnt want to argu with you insideuhhh how about not at all he tri to speak but i say to the bf let go and he start go on and on and i walk around the bf to walk away and the manag say ridicul as hes wail back in ummmm nno i turn around open the door and say that was uncal for and walk away he come out again and say next time you can get a bagel instead of the english muffin well manag of the year there wont be a next time 

ok so so mani thing wrong with this first of all a manag follow me outsid to argu with a custom outsid over a bagel you serious have noth better to do i never had time to do that when i was a manag nor was it someth i wish to do and seek out he was so mad about give me a bagel he steam over it and still felt he hadnt said enough 

second let me inform some of you who might not knowthos bagel you pay 200 and then some onli cost about 25 to make hmmm custom come to my store spend 75 make a valid point about what your crappi onlin menu say give 25 bagel to make custom happi most restaur manag know the common sens in that 

i serious couldnt say enough about this 
uncal for unprofession a frequent custom is now a nonexist im not happi about refus to have their pastri but not worth give ani more of my money to themfrom where i live in north scottsdal  it forti seven mile to this place take over an hour to get there
th line like disneyland pirat of the caribbean
and by the time i got lunch it was two oclock

now i am no kill joy but i paid 3000 for chicken tender and salmon joe what the heck
i wont do that again trust me
thirti buck i should have paid half that  
say it aint so joefast food qualiti with high end restaur wait times

mi wife and i live near downtown phoenixmid town so when peopl give us restaur recommend to trendi spot we love to check them out this place was horrend first of all the wait when we went there was a line we later discov the reason for the line was they had one person on the regist even though the owner was out shake hand and get readi to leav the second regist was never open by the time we got to order 50 minut had pass and we got to the point of where mayb the food qualiti may make up for the horribl wait

nop it took about 5 minut to actual get our food so the issu wasnt food prep it was just the horribl logist of this busi i order a farm burger medium with bacon and chees what i got resembl someth that had been marin in greas for about 12 year then under cook and serv on a delici bun but 2 minut into the meal the bun resembl a soggi rag the fri had a weird tast to them i end up not eat my meal my wife got through about half of her burger befor she complain about the greasiness

i put the burger qualiti on par with an inandout smash burger five guy style burger howev would you wait 30 minut for one of those no so i will never return here and i will chalk up all of the recommend for this place to suburb folk that have never experienc real dinethe worst aw restaur   

 the worst restaur of my life today i  think of the name and it honest make me vomit  eeeeeeeeek   my background im a regist dietitian and also have a certif in foodservic sanit   

now i can continu with my stori my husband and i took a weekend trip to las vega about two week ago and decid to stop by ocean one bar and grill to eat befor the big shop spree on our last day in vega 

let me start by say that the first thing that most peopl notic is the servic  your waiter has to at least look the part and act like he like his job  well my friend my waiter was bad simpli the worst  like good peopl that we are we didnt want to say anyth becaus we felt that it wasnt his fault mayb just have a bad day    i truli believ that he was have a bad day or someth it took about 30 min for our waiter to take our order  second our main entre came befor our appet  

for the sake of the reader i order  oyster and calamari for my appet and  both my husband and i order pasta for our main entre  while eat my pasta my oyster arriv and to my surpris after eat a coupl of oyster and move the empti shell to an empti plate  i found a worm in my next to oyster a live move worm in my plate  of oyster  

i start to gage and ran to the washroom my husband call the waiter and of cours the waiter took it sweet time he final came to the tabl and ask my husband what was the problem  i show him my plate and the worm and said noth but took the plate and came back with my check and charg me for my food and the oyster  no apolog of ani kind  without make a big scene my husband calm ask to speak to the manag  the manag came to our tabl and ask the same stupid question what was the problem  my husband explain the problem and he said what do you want me to do sorri in an upset tone as though he was not sorri  we had paid for our dinner and my husband took the bill and took the money and told the manag i thought that you would at least apolog  for which he respond  i alreadi said sorri what do you want with an attitud   

needless to say pleas befor you go to this restaur read my review and hope that you make a good decis befor  order someth from this aw restauri realli can not believ all the good review of this place mayb they just had a bad day when i went 

if you have ever walk into this place it has a differ vibe i am assum they are go for the beachfront cafe swim suit hang from the ceil surf board lean on the wall and palm everywher i had never been here befor so upon my origin scan of the place it look like you walk up and order then go sit down after stand in the middl of the room look like a lost sheep for about 5 minut they crabbi waitress walk by and crude said   just sit anywher and kept on walk we sat down and both comment to each other  wow that was rude  

she came back a few minut later and hand us 2 menus and quick said  do you need a kid menu we again said yes and it was a good 5 to 10 minut wait for the kid menu onc we final receiv the kid menu and decid what we all want we order 2 cabo salad and a kid chicken finger now just to set the stage here there was 4 tabl with peopl at them and all of them had there food so we happen to be the onli one without food so in my head i figur it would be fast the waitress came by to see if we want someth other than water to drink and i said sure ill take a ice tea she brought the ice tea pretti quick which was nice but a few minut later my ice tea was about half empti and she came by and grab it now i was think that this entir experi was turn around i could not be more wrong rememb that ice tea i was talk about well i didnt becaus she never brought it back she even came by the tabl 5 minut later to tell us that the food we will be out in a few and sorri for the wait now i know i could have said can i have my ice tea back but i figur she may have been busi and i would give her a minut the food came out and i was half way through my salad and decid i would realli like my ice tea so she came by to ask how the food was and i just mention  it is good when you get a chanc can i get an ice tea it took anoth 5 minut for that to come at this point i was done and did not want to be on the beach ani longer the food was okay but the wait servic was less than horribl 

im sorri beach cafe but i will not be back you need to hire some new wait staff and get rid of the grouch you have in the front i have never seen a waitress walk around with such a horribl attitud i know we all have bad day but in a custom contact posit like that you need to be abl to detour your pissi for a littl while

i can get good food anywher good servic is what i am tri to find and beach cafe had no trace of iti was disappoint with the servic and food here  i came in for breakfast on a friday  not busi at all which i cant understand whi the servic was so bad

ther is onli one server who doesnt seem thrill to be there but she was work  she wasnt rude or anyth but she wasnt happi either  there was anoth girl who stay post behind the counter watch tv  she must be the owner or someth becaus she didnt do anyth or interact with ani custom not sit at the counter

mi boyfriend and i order egg benedict and it took over 40 minut to get our food  egg benedict came with a veri small serv of realli greasi home fri aka potato  it was noth special  i was never offer a refil on my drink or ask if everyth was ok or if i need anyth els 

basic if you want to wait a long time for your food and be ignor dure your whole visit  come to the beach cafeunfortun becaus of an issu with the servic and the owner i will not return to this place

what happen well we decid to go to dinner here and sit out on the patio becaus it was a beauti night  when we sat i notic they had the kitchen door prop open which is a huge pet peev for me not onli is it against regul it is gross anyth can make it way into the kitchen and into the food that is be prepar i want to mention this to my server to see if it could be correct in the meantim 2 employe decid to grab a smoke right outsid the kitchen door one of which was the owner wife this realli agit me and thought it was disgusting

when the server return i voic my opinion and she apolog and said she would tell the owner about 10 minut later one of the employe that i saw smoke came out on the patio to steal a few drag off a friend cigarett while the whole time just stare at mea she walk past our tabl she blew the smoke right over to our tabl and smile 

at this point i was furious and just want to pay and leav when the server return i explain what happen and that i wonder if she had mention the situat yet to the owner she said she would let him know a few moment later the owner came to our tabl and said do we have a problem and it was not said in a nice way at alli even doubt what i heard him say and ask what he said again he look at my husband and saiddo you have a problem and then turn to me and said the same thing he was soooo rude i was speechless i just saidnop we do not have a problem we just will not come back he just turn around and walk away

i am not sure whi he respond this way but i will not come back to a place where the manag has such disregard to one of their custom problem  

too bad dinosi like most of your food but you let me downwhat not cook at leopold bakeri is ani semblanc of servic respons or follow up we call for a cake for our wed and spoke to nick nick said we had to talk to alicia who was gone for the day but would call us the next day

no call and nick promis follow up call never came either so we follow up the next day they claim that they left us a messag on all three phone mobil and land line but we receiv no messages

then alicia had gone for the day so she was go to call us back the next morn again no call but this time i follow up and call her myself now she said that they could not deliv the cake on the day that they said they could deliv it when first i spoke to nick howev alicia said she could definit do it on saturday if the restaur where we were have our recept dinner could store it for a night

alicia told me to call them and then call her back and ill get you a cake on saturday okay so i call the hotel restaur and they said no problem so my fianc call alicia back

oh no alicia said i told your husband when i call him this morn that we could not deliv a cake this weekend what is she smoke first of all she did not call me i call her second she was the one who told me that she could do it on saturday it was not even my idea now it was imposs even though she said she could do it

needless to say now it is too late to have anyon els do the wed cake so we are complet without one fortun were in love and not have a wed cake becaus leopold has the worst follow up and worst custom servic i have ever experienc will not spoil anyth for us

but if you want good servic and you want to have your wed cake for your special day pleas pleas pleas do not use leopold use freed or retro or one of the other respect bakeri leo may have amaz cake but what good is that if they do not valu you as a custom enough to even deliv on their promis to you on such an amaz import and special day as your wed daydont order from here if you actual want your cake terribl terribl custom servic on an item that was veri import to us our wed cake

nick is a nice guy and i think he did what he could i place an order with him for our wed cake live in california i chose from their websit size frost flavor on the layer the whole deal

th first day i call nick took the messag for a woman name alicia who he said is in charg of wed cake and promis a call back later that day she did not return the call so i call again the next day she still was not there and i got nick again he said i am off tomorrow but if i have to drive in person i will make sure she return your call

sh didnt and he was off the next day i got him again and this is the day he took the order himself he again promis this mysteri alicia would call us for deliveri detail and whatnot

sh did not the next day my now husband call the bakeri while i stood next to him he got alicia howeveralicia told him that she could no longer make the cake becaus they were complet book on deliveri for that day my husband ask if she could make it if it could be deliv the day befor the wed she said she could and told him to make arrang with the hotel to accept deliveri and store the cake and call her back he told her we would call the palazzo and make the arrangements

i call the palazzo and they were wonder accommod they would be prepar to accept deliveri the day befor the wed and they would safe store the cake for us

i call alicia and was pleas to actual reach her i told her my name and let her know the palazzo had agre to accept the cake the day prior she then proceed to tell me that we had not order a cake with them 

i told her that we had that i had person place the order with nick and recount the detail of the order 

this is the best part she told me that it had not been written up on the correct form and therefor we had no order

and

that when she call my husband yesterday he had call her and i was stand next to him she had alreadi told him that

i move forward with an attempt at logic i will confess irrit at this point so i might not have been my usual love self i was start to think about how littl i care about cake in the scheme of thing i point out that i had been stand with him and she had told us to follow up with the hotel to see if we could have an earlier deliveri date and whi would we have want that if there was no order an no possibl for an item cake to be delivered

sh was as help as she had been the entir time and just kept repeat that she told my husband yesterday that she could not do the cake

so we serious had no wed cake at our wed she did take the time to go on yelp and respond to my husband accur yelp about leopold she said that i misunderstood her 

the wed hadnt happen yet so he told her to make it happen the cake and it would all be fine 

we never heard anoth thing 

as an asid when i call the palazzo to cancel the deliveri arrang they said they usual do busi with freed and i should use them the next time i need a cake in vegas

th whole wed day i kept think leopold would do someth the day of the wed but they never show call nothing

on a fun note someon who knew noth of our cake situat sent a surpris box of cupcak obvious not from the nonperform leopold to the concierg for us at the hotel so we had a cupcak festiv in the privaci of our room

best of all i have the one and onli man of my dream for my husband i am sure there will be lot of cake in our futurlate post in octob i was refer to roll in dough aka leopold  decid to get my daughter 4th birthday cake with them i must admit i was in a bit of a jam sinc i was order the cake onli 3 week befor the event  never tast ani of their stuff 

i went in with my daughter  came prepar with two page of photo of what i want the tall pretti blond ladi that help me was pleasant howev she immedi down sell me to a cheaper cake when i inquir about a two tier cake 

i suppos i look broke to her she kept tell me that all the cake on display were extrem expens again i must have look like a poor mexican girl on welfar that she couldnt even give me quot on them 

next i ask for a sampl of their differ cake flavor  was told they dont have ani or do that  howev a coupl that walk in were prompt sat  sampl display for their engag cake  mayb you need an appoint but i wasnt told that 

i didnt need a larg cake onli for about 30 kid howev be a new custom i expect better servic instead of that unfortun for them my servic will now go to bakeri that have better custom servic 

i agre to a small round cake for about 1520 peopl  this was strict for young kid btw  i repeat told her that the mold of an equestrian ride helmet whip  blue ribbon were to cover the entir top of the cake she said yes yes yes  what i got was these stupid tini mold that made my alreadi small cake look even smaller she told me that they love ad glitter to their cake  would do so for freecom day of pick upno glitter  i complain that the mold were not what i ask for  she had the nerv to tell me that i didnt request that  that i was complet wrong  

i took my cake  left annoy but luckili it was my daughter birthday  noth could ruin that day cake was moist  delici but never go back sinc custom servic suck i dont know nor care if that was a busi day week or month for them if they couldnt satisfi my order tell me  let work with what you can do dismiss me as they did was rude  unprofessionanoth chicken  burger joint that has pop up over by boulevard mallso i decid to give it a go

loc insid the seafood supermarket i had no idea it was a filipino fast food franchiseit simpli read chicken  burgers

i dont realli have much to say on this onei bare got past the smell of the burger to take the one bite i tri befor spit it out definit an acquir tast becaus the place was pack and everyon els seem to be enjoy the chicken meal not too mani eat burgeri just dont get this place the food is decent but the waitress are horribl the bartend has zero person and it isnt clean i realli want to like this place but it so hard too 

one of the waitressess actual told me onc that there was a regular custom  who no one like and that they drew straw to see who was go to wait on him when you tell anoth custom that it is realli sad

not keen on go backwow what a disappoint bertha turn out to be

first off they need to take the sign down from their old locat which i went to and drove around like a chicken with it head cut off look for the place

second their onlin menu is not current i went here becaus of the tastysound buffalo chicken wrap which they no longer have the menu pictur that someon post on yelp is way too tini to read

third they forgot my fruit salad 3 which i didnt realiz until i had drive all the way home i call to inform them of their mishap and the woman on the phone was confus as to what they forgot she kept ask me what i order and didnt understand that they forgot my fruit salad ugh annoyed

fourth my salami was serv on a stale ciabatta it was overload with goat chees on one half and skimp on the other  the amount of salami was skimpi as well

fifth the sandwich dont come with chip  i am a firm believ that all sandwich should come with a side and i am grate to place that includ them in the price

sixth the red velvet cupcak were dri and the frost was mediocr  not cream cheesi at all

6 mishap and bertha get one star 

on a good note their cooki that came with the sandwich was delici as was their passion tea

dont wast your timei have never left a sushi bar so angri and exasper in my life
koi has more rule than a elementari school cafeteria at lunchtime

they dont let you go outsid for anyth onc food is on your tabl not until you pay the check 
they tack on a 1518 gratuiti even if the servic is subpar and normal at place where gratuiti is automat tack on to the bill it is 

i was includ in a parti of 15 for my friend birthday parti and part of the desir to give our patronag to koi was the allucaneat sushi which a portion of this parti has indulg in on a previous visit 

when we were seat the waitress told us that a portion of our parti couldnt order the allucaneat sushi it had to be all 15 of us or none of us 

we were contempl just get up and leav and we should have i had a feel this wasnt go to end well and it didnt 

the birthday girl decid to stay and we order then we were inform that they wouldnt accept certain coupon from the arrowhead koi this is like a disenfranchis franchis the owner seem to be creat his own rule it didnt even say arrowhead on the coupon it just look like one they didnt take accord to the waitress 

the servic was slow veri slow and we wait to get drink refil then the waitress came back to tell the birthday girl that someon took her order so she had to wait for it to be remad 

all the sushi roll look the same there was no artist valu to the food i couldnt tell the spici tuna tempura apart from the tempura calamari roll and the tast reflect same quit disappoint sinc sushi is an art form when done correct or just done better

th waitress left dish and empti glass on our tabl for the entireti of the meal and when she did final clear thing away she drop dirti soy sauc chop stick right on the birthday girl lap yes there was an apolog on the part of the waitress but it shouldnt have happened

accord to the friend that have come to koi befor they rais their price and they dont take american express and they dont have a happi hour  the larg beer were 6  at yen i could get the same for 3 

we all decid that we are not go to koi ever again tonight they just lost 15 custom 

pretti pathetwith all the hype around sprinkl i decid to drive around this weekend and check out the cupcak place around town

what a disappoint the store is tini no none nada organ to handl custom it was an absolut mad hous peopl act like drone stand in a huddl mass wait for someon to get them a freakin over price cupcak it was an absolut joke

i end up leav after wait 10 minut and still no one to get me a cupcak 

mayb the hollywood cupcak madam should come and tend to her scottsdal storeeveri onc in a while you have an experi that remind you of the way thing are  and you know what  there just no better way to clarifi onc and for all how disgust lopsid america class system has becom than a trip to sprinkl  

a friend from cali just had to go here and so i was brought along  i watch with a mixtur of amus and anger as siliconestuf scottstitut line up one after anoth to pay over 3 for 5 cent worth of ingredi in a box  i wonder what sort of moron pay 36 for 12 cupcak  ill answer that question for you someon with more money than intellect  my friend insist i couldnt judg their decis until i purchas one myself  i grudg fork over my 325 for a dark chocol cupcake

with near willi wonkaesqu ineffici the ladi behind the counter final present me with my cupcak which had been place in a box and seal with a sticker  i cant imagin a more wast way to disburs with a singl bake good  im sure part of the 325 pay for this cardboard and sticker which will be prompt discard by the consumer

on to the cupcak itself  it was good  not great but good  ill make no excus it tast nice  the cake tast like it should and the frost was soft  it tast like someth mom might have made when you were kid  with that said my mother would never have spent 325 on a cupcak  i have no problem with pay more for consider better food or expertis in prepar  but you cant tell me that there a rocket scienc to make cupcak  this is pure conspicu consumpt for peopl with lot of extra cash and veri littl go on  how is it that in a countri with more than 45 million without healthcar the wealthi have noth better to do with their money than the purchas of design cupcak  

mi advic do someth better with your money  youll weigh less and feel better  and if you want a cupcak go to the store and buy the ingredi to make a dozen  cupcak are not exact tough to make  and with the 30 or so you have left buy some food for your local shelter or food pantriover the past seven year we wife and i have dine here about 6 times

both cake flavor were off way off the batter was not mix well and had chunk of unfullyincorpor ingredi in it it was the heaviest cupcak i have ever had and tast as if it had been bake two week ago and recent thaw that was part of the off flavor to me 

the frost was one note hellasweet i even overheard some kid complain about it and if that doe not speak volum i dont know what would the frost was also exceed dens and did not tast fresh i normal love frost and would never have complain about the copious amount on these cupcak if it had actual tast even a littl bit good

niec pancak were dri she said not even syrup could save them bf tri her cake and agre that they were the driest he had ever had she also said her sausag was bland 

mi egg benedict florentin was not good first off they put swiss chees on them chees hm one of my egg was total undercook and beyond runni the other was total overcook and the yolk was all dri out one of my english muffin was stale and i couldnt even cut through it

th spinach was good but that was about it oh yeah the total for this crappi breakfast 67wowi dont even know where to start  the beginningthat usual a good place

so the littl ladi and i had just finish up with yoga and switch was in the veri near vicin  so we figur itd be a good choic  wrong  we were greet in a somewhat time fashion and seat  then we wait for a whileand then a littl more  the hostess was wipe off a nearbi tabl and ask if we had been help yet and when we said no she went to find our server  appar he didnt know we were his tabl  ok it happen to me befor im will to forgiv  our server chris came over and we order our food and drink  he came back with our bev and then he didnt stop by again until food came out meanwhil we had push both of our empti water glass and my empti coffe mug to the end of the tablehop that he would get the hint  nope  then the food came and he final ask if we want more to drink  he drop off water and coffe and was gone until the end of our meal which wasnt even good  was this a joke  he come over and say so how is everyth guy my woman repli with ive had better can we pleas get the check and he didnt even ask what was wrong  he brought the check and we were go to split it down the middl and he said they were have system issu and couldnt split it  fine one cardjust get us the eff outta here  when he brought the card back he liter toss it on the tabl and told us to have a good day as he was walk away

hello yelper 

recent  i had a experi at a golden corral restaur that concern me enough to write to their corpor offic not onc but twice  after receiv no respons i thought i might as well add this to my  yelp review  i believ it incumb upon manag to put thing right for ani and all concern a guest may have while dine at their establish i have never experienc manag at a corpor level fail to respond in a time manner when a guest address a concern with the vast amount of establish to dine at one would think that the last thing manag at ani restaur would want is to have a guest  leav unhappi or in my case to never come back again  rather then write a strateg rant i have decid to attach the letter i sent to corpor headquart 


septemb 23 2013 

corpor offic of golden corral 

i am write this letter to discuss a recent experi i had at your golden corral restaur locat at 420 n dysart rd goodyear arizona 623 9259075  i have visit this locat mani time and have alway enjoy the qualiti of food and superior servic  howev my latest visit to golden corral has me veri concern as a guest   

on saturday septemb 21 around 1130 am i visit your restaur to purchas a dozen roll for a bbq i was have later that day  when i return home and open the box of roll i notic that the roll were hard and somewhat overcook  i realiz this has happen to us all at one time or anoth each of us has order food at a restaur and gotten someth that differ from our expect to some degre i appreci that restaur work is a veri challeng busi and sometim cook and chef can get caught up in a multitud of order all at the same time and the qualiti of a product can suffer  i usual do not return food but i realli want to serv the roll at the bbq so i went back to have the roll replac 

i arriv at the restaur around 125 pm and ask to speak with a manag whose name i do not recal  to be fair the manag came over apolog and he offer a replac dozen of roll fresh out of the oven and advis it would be about 6 minut that was nice my concern lie in the statement the manag made after he took the dozen roll i brought back  the manag ask if i had touch the roll becaus if i had not touch the roll they could be use to make bread pud  at that moment i want to leav the restaur and i would have left had the replac roll not came fresh out of the oven my concern lie in the area of food health and safeti issu  is take return food from guest and reus it standard oper procedur for golden corral 

i am not an expert by ani mean in the area of food prepar  howev i do realiz that food safeti is a scientif disciplin and the proper handl prepar and storag of food is the onli way  to prevent foodborn ill food can transmit diseas from person to person and standard precaut should alway be adher to  when you are a guest at ani food establish your thought is the food ought to be safe and the prepar of the food should be such as to avoid potenti sever health hazard such as take return food from a guest and reus that product 

i am not sure if i will ever revisit golden coral again but i know without a doubt that  i will never go back to your avondal locat  the thought of reus food that a guest return is enough to keep me from come back to that locat

p  what up with those park bench for tabl       sunday brunch buffet       

have had a reason good experi at dos gringo mexigril sunday brunch buffet in chandler last week i decid to give this one a tri today  precondit to their nutbal build  total anti polit correct theme i was readi for the stuff paint on the wall such as women love men who eat taco  over 1000000 taco serv  are you next  what i wasnt prepar for was a short serv of lukewarm food choic in a cold restaurant

th indoor of this place is virtual outdoor  it was cold raini  windi outsid  now i dont expect them to remodel the place for me but there no excus for have a brunch buffet  then have onli a littl food out there plus empti serv tray  offer food that should be hot at near room temperatur  there need to be a minimum of tabl servic too even though it a buffet  there wasnt  for instanc i had to use my plate over again to go for some second of the mediocr food

they should stop have the sunday brunch buffet if they cant do better than this  for the record it 799 but skip itnow im not a buffet kind of person but i wound up here this even now whi peopl would go here baffl me the server in the front are rude no hello hi pleas thank you or your welcom from the ladi shirley i felt like i was in a cattl herd wait in the line and get my way to the front lucki for me i had great compani so i put up with it
w got seat and went up to the buffet this was the smallest buffet select i have ever seen which i guess could be good becaus the food was aw i took a littl bit of the butter noodl which were so hard and crispi noth like a flimsi noodl should be the beef in the asian dish was extra chewi i sampl some of the taco meat mexican rice and bean mix all togeth on my plate and got a piec of plastic in my mouth yes you read right plastic in my food i was instant turn off from anyth els in order to pleas my parti i ate a slice of pineappl some cottag chees and the wimpi salad bar as for dessert in the ice cream section they give you warm bowl it melt my poor vanilla ice cream into soup
thi place just left me disgust and sick to my stomach that is hard to do but they sure did it
thank paradis buffet i will not be return and you can keep your plastic with your rude employei would give this place 0 star if it was at all possible

w there a few week ago to meet some friend to watch some preseason footbal out waitress was nice the food was good and the beer was cold it was a good experi till the 4th quarter

th tabl in front of us had a femal drink a beer who was stand for a bit block our view final after a few minut out friend lean over to their tabl and ask nice if she could sit so we could see the game she respond i work here and gave us a dirti look realli and what doe that have to do with the fact that we couldnt see 

she was clear not work at the moment she was hold a beer and an unlit cigarett and ask her to sit seem like a simpl request she sat and began talk about our tabl to her friend who were with her our waitress stop by to see if we need anyth and as she walk away the stand girl pull her asid we watch her talk and point at our tabl to our waitress and when we made eye contact she flip us off yes she liter told us she work there and then flip us off i have never been so disrespect as a patron of a restaurant

furi now we ask for a manag and he came over we told him what happen and he apolog for her and said he would talk to her a few minut later she came back over and sat at her tabl proceed to talk about us again final the manag told her to leav he came back to our tabl to let us know that she had been drink he ask her to leav and would be talk to her when she was sober 

just to confirm i wasnt crazi or overreact a woman at an uninvolv tabl came by our after it was over and told us she watch the whole thing and was on our side she couldnt believ that an employe would be so rude and flip us off 

i guarante i wont be back for anymor footbal game or anyth els i will not give a dime to a restaur that employ peopl who think it is ok to disrespect patron regardless of it they are on or off the clocki had so mani ppl tell me sushi broker would be a gr8 place to eat sushi at especi have live in japan in for so long  i believ hiro sushi  have yet to find a find anoth place that can match them  
when we walk in the loud hellish music remind me of ra  i hate ra  their wanna ambienc  strike 1 against sushi brokers
th waitress was more intent on make a good impress with my boyfriend who was wear his retir from the air forc polo than she was in address me  definit strike 2  i was happi to sign the check and leav her a 01 tip in her hand  yes i walk up to her and person deliv it
th fish was spoil to the owner  if you dont know how to keep your fish at the right temperatur learn and quick  your fish tast horriblhappi hour here is an actual joke there should be rule about fair happi hour price becaus anybodi can say it happi hour but do you realli mean it you sleazi restaur owner yeah the long island ice tea is 4 but after i mention that the thing has no alcohol in it waitress admit that they use a premad mix veri expens drink and beer onli garner a 2 discount and the worst item on the food menu seem to be discount most like tempura crap and endamm i dont even eat sushi but my veri scottsdaleish date did and she ate a 15 roll for happi hour  yes she is a golddigg but even that roll should be discount 
i suppos i could write it off as scottsdal price but not for happi hour no 2nd date and no return to this establish oh our waitress was nice would have must rather been on a date with heri know this is a fair popular sushi place and i have actual enjoy their food befor but my experi today was horribl it wasnt the servic it wasnt the food actual i decid not to order and give them my money and i will explain whi 

when you enter the restaur there is a big chalkboard abov the sushi bar that read happi hour sunday get fresh start at 11am or someth along those line 
i came in with a group of about 20 peopl and we all interpret that sign as if happi hour start at 11am on sunday wouldnt you 

our server explain to us that this was incorrect that happi hour actual start at 300pm realli she said she would ask if her manag would honor what the sign said as that was a motiv factor for our group choos this restaur to begin with just a few week befor some of us did in fact get happi hour on a sunday at 11am 

minut later the manag molli approach our tabl and proceed to tell me im not sure whi she singl me out that iwe misinterpret the sign and get fresh at 11am has noth to do with happi hour i didnt see will smith so im not sure what the hell get fresh meant she kept repeat do you get it in a veri aggress and condescend manner 

anyway the point is her attitud was appal not onli did she refus to honor the signag for our parti she also jump down my throat other member at our tabl verbal acknowledg her rude to her face and she still did noth to fix the situat no apolog noth 

for that reason i refus to order and will never return i have no idea whi she is in manag or where she pick up her communic skill if i was her gm i would replac her veri quick or at the veri least keep her in back of hous and out of custom servic 

epic fail molli read a book on find your happi place medit take some med someth you made my experi a total bummertonight was one of the insult pathet display of custom servic we have had  
mi wifei gluten free and after clear state this to the server and order a suppos gluten free item grill mahi mahi on corn tortilla they serv the taco on flour tortilla and continu to insist they were corn tortilla  the manag final got involv and admit they were flour tortilla and the menu has a mistak  for a celiac this is a pretti big mistak and can caus sever problem  at this point there was realli noth left to order except sashimi  she also ad on a salad at which point the server ask if cucumb are okay for gluten free
clear this restaur need to better train the staff on what this mean  the manag was also veri unaccommod and unapologetic
unfortun this is a place with decent sushi that we will never be in again due to their complet incompet regard accommod special dietari requirsushi broker was my go to sushi restaur  for the past 4 year the servic has alway been terribl but i have been abl too look past that as i favor all of their special roll this sunday we went for mother day and onc again the servic was terribl truth there are quit a few good server out there i have no idea whi sushi broker consist hire bad waitress im not a veri difficult person but after 10 minut with empti water and ice tea glass i final had to ask the bus boy to pleas get us refil this happen 3 time that night as our server was no where to be found anyway the worst part of the night and the reason for the review was the food poison that i got within 30 minut of eat i have never been so sick in my life we order the sushi pizza the spici tuna and the cowboy roll all which contain raw tuna we notic for the first time that the sushi didnt have the usual fresh tast it normal doe but ate it anyway big mistak when deal with raw fish you should be held to a differ standard i feel sick just think about how violent ill we got from eat here suffic to say we will not be return and advis our friend to avoid sushi broker as wellme and my wife went to san felip cantina in temp az saturday 62808 they wouldnt let me in becous i have my daughter name tattoo on my neck they said just that day manag told the worker not to let peopl in with tattoo abov there shoulder so becous if this kind of stereotyp or racism i rate san felip cantina in temp az zero star and the worst bar in azthis place has a cool retro chic thing go for it as far the interior is concern but all the loveli end there   first off the entranc is kind of awkward  as soon as you walk into the bistro you are in the middl of the restaur traffic pathway  it is a small place and you feel somewhat cramp and there was no hosthostess in sight  one of the bartend greet us and let us pick our spot there werent too mani option so we sat by the door  the bartend took our drink order which by the way they onli serv half bottl of wine but still charg full bottl price and then said the waitress would be right over to get our food order  we perus the menu sever time and were still wait on the waitress to come our way  she pass by us mani time but seem too concern with the other tabl  final we palc our order after the bartend had to tell her mani time that we were readi  we split a salad and then place an order of the buffalo stax and the build your own beef stax  they never ask how we want them cook and to be quit honest it did not dawn on us until we were eat them but mine arriv veri well done and my boyfriend arriv raw in the middl and burn on the outsid  needless to say we were upset but veri hungri and ate what we could  

i think the staff is too preoccupi with keep a trendi scottsdal imag that they lack qualiti on the food and servic level  it quit a shame bc the locat is great and they would have no problem keep regular come to an overpr burger joint  i would never go back here again  the meal made both me and my boyfriend ill befor we made it home onli 10 minut away

if you want an overpr but yummi burger then go to delux burgerit has been a long time sinc i have post a review on yelp that becaus it been a long time sinc i have felt passion enough about a dine experi one way or anoth to throw my proverbi 2 cent in unfortun stax was such a horribl experi that i had to yelp about it  

i dont know if it was just becaus of the open patio or what but we sat insid and there were fli and moth all over the place i just hope the kitchen isnt some nightmar that i would see on a gordon ramsey show 

the menu look promis with sever differ style of burger rang from the mundan to the exot side and differ aoli which is realli mayo just mix with someth els and put into a cup the thing that realli bother me is that there are no regular french fri call me old fashion but i love french fri and dont understand this decis 

i got both style of beef burger and the meat was overcook dri and the food took over an hour to get out they also forgot our sweet potato fri and onion ring and those took anoth 15 minut to get out needless to say the servic was terribl the waitress didnt even know what desert they had she had to look at a menu

to sum it up horribl servic terribl food and extrem overpr the onli peopl i could see like this place are peopl who like to be scene but if your look for a good burger you will do yourself a favor to go someplac elsi actual love the food here  everyth is fantast but i have decid to write a review for anoth reason  3 week ago i ate at stax as i have mani time and my final bill was 2510 and the person who ran my card turn out to be the owner charg me 7710   overcharg by 5200 is quit a bit but would not have deter me from go back if it was settl appropri  i notic the charg pend and decid to wait a coupl day and hope onc the charg clear it would be the 2510 i had expect  the charg end up clear for 7710 and i call stax to inform them of this and was assur that the overcharg of 52 would be readili return to my account  i wait about a week and still noth  i decid to go in and speak with an ownermanag direct  after wait 20 minut for the owner to get off a person phone call with someon he seem to be in a dramat relationship with he final was avail to help me  i explain what had happen and he seem annoy that i came in to bother him with someth like this ask umm this is a hassl for us whi didnt you just call your credit card compani  i ask if i could just get cash sinc i was here and the refund had never been process  he said no and that he would work with his account to get it settl  he even tri to take my onli copi of the receipt and when i said i was go to keep it he got even more annoy ask you dont trust me im the owner  all in all i have wait anoth week call my credit card compani who state they have to give stax 30 day to refund my money sinc they initi said they were go to and noth has happen  im so veri disappoint with how this situat was handl and that the owner clear doe not care about keep costum that have been frequent his restaur sinc it open    i know this is not a food review but although i love the food here i will not be return to stax sinc i have been treat so poor  you would think that an owner of a small privat busi would be bend over backward to keep his clientel when he make a mistak of this magnitud  i guess notupdat my review becaus im total piss off your hamburg arent good enough for me to constant be super piss off with you guys

i have come in sever time with larg parti small parti refer peopl here and i take it all back 

i came in with a friend and we werent given the tabl becaus they were hold it just in case a larger parti came in what were your custom and guess what we are here now 

are you sure a larger parti will come in  no are we not worthi of a seat becaus there arent 5 us well accord to stax that the case 

well f that

 i will glad go somewher els and be sure to tell everyon how aw you are besid your just in case guest are far more import than the one current there readi to pay 

so long staxi  recent visit claddagh irish pub in middleton greenway station for a happi hourmunchi thing after work with a pal we had beer share an order of the corn beef and cabbag roll and split a paddi mac sandwich which is essenti a reuben the food was quit good i especi enjoy the corn beef and cabbag roll which when i went were similar to a fri wonton that had the fix of st patrick day dinner insid sort of like an irish egg roll yum the reuben was averag but the fri were pretti tasti as well servic was unremark in either a good or a bad way all said and done i would usual rank that sort of experi as four star normal i would definit return to a restaur that show me a good time and had good food 

whi then you ask is this a one star review let me explain

i take major major issu with claddagh use of the word gluten friend to describ certain menu item menu item that are often serv with bread  i presum this was done in an effort to appeal to the nowpopular dietari trend of avoid gluten the problem with this claddagh is that gluten friend is not a thing if someon cant eat gluten then they cant eat gluten period full stop 

claddagh use of the term gluten friend  to describ food that still contain gluten would be like if jif peanut butter made a new type of peanut butter that was 50 peanut and 50 almondsand then tri to market the new product as peanut allergi friend doe that make sense

 although i person find  vagu claim of gluten intoler dubious especi when the person has never had a problem eat gluten befor there are definit peopl with a medic diagnosi of celiac diseas who absolut under no circumst can consum gluten i feel that claddagh attempt at market it menu to appeal to the glutenfre dietari trend could harm peopl who actual need to avoid gluten for import medic reason even if it not a life or death situat peopl who wish to avoid gluten should be allow to do so without have to jump through hoop and worri about be trick by menus 

it major uneth to twist word to impli that a thing is someth that it not this is especi true when the item in question food has the potenti to direct impact a person health 

claddagh fix your menu if you want to offer glutenfre option then pleas do so howev refer to a spinachartichok dip appet serv with crostini or to a hamburg serv on a wheat bun  or even to your fish fri which is batter in flour as gluten friend is uneth peopl have a right to know what in their food and this feel like a deliber attempt to mislead peopl in the name of make more moneyi came here a long time ago when i was an undergrad and i rememb like it but that was befor i knew about yelp  luckili i swung through on super sunday to reminisc about my recent pass colleg days

a group of friend and i 4 total roll in to grab a quick breakfast  they have a counter besid the sit down area where there is a rush hour menu  rush hour  that must mean they get that shit readi fast  or it for pair of asian and black detect  we guess the former

so my friend and i each get a bagel sandwich  noth veri fanci  it was like egg some veggi and a littl meat in a bagel of our choic  no sweat right  it realli wasnt even that busi in there no line everyon get seat immediately

so we sat  wander  bsd  ogl a coupl hungov girl stumbl in  normal stuff  but we didnt see shit go on  nobodi look like they were prepar out rush hour sandwich  we wait  we ping the manag and he said they would be on their way out

aft a half hour three of the sandwich came out  of cours my sandwich wasnt readi  must have been chop up all those bell peppersthos littl guy are so tough  or perhap they were curdl the chees as i wait  5 minut later my sandwich got there

mi friend brought up the fact of how long it took to make

pat hey what up with take over half an hour to make these simpl sandwiches
manag not realli it was like 15 minutes
pat no look at our receipt  theyr timestamp  look at the clock now it is past 12 hour now
manag ok
pat that it  what kind of respons is that
manag no responseperhap think about how he hate life

and that was it  and the sandwich suck  and they gave us the wrong bagel  awesom  and them damn thing cost like 5 bucks

in summary
rush hour menu is bullshit
c get basic order right
manag a jerk

i cant speak to how the sitdown area is  i enjoy it a long time ago  but i wouldnt ever go back with what a letdown this past experi was  even if the manag had said sorri about the wait i might have want to come back  i wouldnt even want my money back  but he basic was like what the fuck is your problemi order a bratwurst here dure a layov at the phoenix intern airport and boy did the experiencehow can i put it lightlysucked

i dont know whi on earth they were even call this a brat it was a hot dog with jalapeno and onion on top of a super stale and dri cornmeallik bun i think i end up eat half of it like lasagnaand threw the rest awayup in the toilet that is

if it is store polici to not speak to the custom then the staff is do their job veri well they said absolut no word dure the purchas of the mealinclud when my order was readi instead they just stood there stare at peopl like neanderthalsand were veri snooti snooti yes snooti i suppos the job is not so easi they couldnt do it

i hope the hq of jodi maroni doe a major overhaul of this locat becaus it could be someth cool until thenstay veri far away

you were warned

your truly
ab froman the sausag king of chicagomy friend decid to tri this place out sinc weve been to most of the pho place on spring mountain  pho hung is a littl bit farther away from all of the hustl and bustl  we were here in the morn around 10ish  the restaur was practic empti which was not a good sign  we should have ran out of this place right away but fool that we were we suck up and sat down  

our waitress was friend and help  but that about it  i order beef stew with baguett but they didnt have ani baguett  they didnt have time to drive to lee sandwich  so i order their spici beef noodl our waitress said they didnt have it today  i end up with crab meat noodl soup per the waitress recommend  

we also order rice with grill pork chop and eggrol beef noodl pho bo crab meat noodl bun rieu chicken noodl pho ga  the pork chop was burn and dri  it look like it been around for a few day  the eggrol were veri funki look and orang  my crab meat made it into littl patti and deep fri  ive never had it deep fri befor and it just did not tast good  their beef noodl was ok  howev it didnt make up for the rest of the order  i have to give it 15 star  

this review was written per my hubbi request becaus i wasnt plan to write one henc no photo  mayb i should go back next time just for the photo yeah rightwe have been go to mrs white for year now we would go there as a treat everi so often becaus there food was fantast unfortun it has realli gotten pretti bad in the last year or so it realli sad to we love mrs white but not anymor 
    the last coupl time we went the food was pretti sub par the portion were much smaller and the qualiti and tast was rather poor a coupl of time ago we went with myself my mother and my brother i dont want this to sound racist but i feel it need to said i felt like we were definit the wrong color to be eat there 
   the servic was ok but i notic it was much better for the local who were there at the same time we order and sat and wait for our meal i watch as some of the peopl around me were brought the same thing i had order and it look fantast nice big piec of chicken with larg portion of side 
    well final our food came and what a disappoint our portion were much smaller then everyon els and the side were about half the size my mother order catfish her favorit thing there and it look like it was half a filet my smother chicken was 2 veri small wing and one small breast i had order all white meat and there was veri littl gravi and cabbag 
     i went ahead and tri mrs white one last time a coupl week ago and it was more of the same thing i order the smother chicken again and when it arriv i receiv 2 small wing and a back bone with no meat the tabl right behind me had the same thing and receiv 2 larg breast and a nice size wing after attempt to eat the skin off the back bone i gave up and ate what littl els there was on the plate my mother did get a nice size catfish filet but both our side were veri small 
    i no longer recommend mrs white it look like the kid have taken over run the place and i think that the problem the gentleman who was alway in the kitchen did a wonder job of make the place a great choic for fantast food but i dont see him there much anymor 
   stay away from mrs white unless you happen to be the right color veri sadfirst off i would like to punch the dip shit on the food network who said this was the best chicken he ever ate yeah the place is filthi but how they oper their busi is redicolus servic suck 49 minut wait for the food suck wait 20 minut from the first  entre be drop off until the last person luckili receiv their food suck be told on the 59th minut of a hour wait for your food that they are out of your side dish suck spend my hard earn money at a place that is ass backward in ani kind of busi sens suck at first our group thought it was a joke then the revers racism theori was brought up then we notic that everi tabl was experienc the same lack of servic black white purpleorang they just sucki have vascil on mrs white for a few year now today visit seal the deal for me on whi i wont return 

i got a togo order of fri chicken black eye pea and rice with gravi sinc they were out of mac  chees at 1130 am as i wait for my order i watch sever plate of chicken be deliv to custom eat in the piec were so huge they were half fall off the plate and tower abov them i look forward to the same as i drove home especi sinc i paid 1481 for my lunch and that did not includ a beverag imagin my dismay as i open my box at home and discov three tini piec of underseason notsofresh tast chicken what the hell you give the sit down custom the best you have to offer becaus they might complain otherwis you give me some bullshit chicken becaus i am do carryout the pea were mush the rice  gravi was bland and the cornbread was overdon on the outsid and heavi and underdon insid i guess your overcharg your custom to bankrol your retir which will sure come sooner rather than later sinc i cant imagin how your keep customfood is decent not the best mexican food it about 775 for a 2item combo dure lunch no rice or bean taco shell was drip with greas and the meat was room temp that appet right

th worst waitress ever we thought she was either drunk or on some sort of drug we tip the bus boy instead it was too late to ask for a differ food serverw were stuck with her 

waitress told us she was go to clear off dish at anoth tabl and will be back to take our order even after we were sit there wait alreadi for 10 minut and told her we were readi to orderw saw her chat with anoth tabl who doe this

th busboy act more profession than the food server she was inyourfac patron rather a veri fake friend and act like someon who had been drink it was realli uncomfortable

chip and salsa were good

not a good valu for the priceportion

hostess was friend 

i would never eat here again esp sinc there are so mani other choic for mexican food in the valleythe antistarbuck starbuck hard a departur from the worthless coffe chain offer includ lame 8 sandwich that are neither tasti nor interest ultra modern decor that attempt to convey im cool and modern but realli convey i dont have a soul a menu that is display on a flat screen tv what a pointless wast of money nervous server w a dubious nonspecif european accent and of cours illi brand coffe and espresso yawnill get the good part out of the way first 

the food overal was pretti good i had the parallel tast menu which includ shrimp two way cevich with avocado crispi with chili sauc roast sea bass rabbit with truffl and fettuccin beef loin sweetbread and macaron and creme brule for dessert the rabbit and the dessert were the main standout for me my friend had the wine pair along with it but he said the pair were not all that great

th other highlight foodwis were the onion soup serv in puff pastri and the dessert sampler 

okay now for the rest i hope your not go anywhere

th servic here was atroci call me crazi but if im dine at a one michelin star restaur with a group of peopl whose tab is over 1100 buck am i wrong to expect servic that better than my local chili i guess so

w were seat by one waitercaptain and order drink my friend wife order a glass of wine and anoth person order a cocktail amaretto sour we then proceed to order dinner about half the tabl want the tast menu while the other half want to go ala cart the waiter said that would be just fine we also indic that we were go to be pay separatelyalso told that would be fine

food servic began those that order the tast menu got their food first the head waitercaptain differ guy now fail to describ all of the cours after they were serv he total flub the dessert coursebas seem like he had no idea what they were serv the half of the tabl that order the tast menu got almost all of their food befor the other half got their so half of our parti just sat there twiddl their thumb while the other ate

fin the other food came out sever peopl order steak none of them were ask if their steak was cook to their prefer my friend wife that order one glass of wine she was brought two for some reason she also order a side dish that was never serv 

throughout the meal no water glass were refil i had to ask each time for more water empti cocktail glass sat unbuss breadcrumb were never swept away empti sweeten packet were left on the tabl 

after everyon had eaten they brought out dessert menus we look but opt not to order anyth for some reason two dessert were brought to our tabl we thought that sinc no one order anyth these must have been given to us grati nope they show up on our bill

speak of the bill like i said earlier we had indic that we were go to be pay separ the waiter told us that he couldnt split it for us but if we want to person divid up the check he could put it on multipl card we gave in and did it as were talli up the tab for everyon head waiter dude come back and basic chastis us say you know if you would have told me at the begin of the meal that you want the check separ i could have done it then but now it too late realli dude fuck you

th last straw was when we final had our bill sort everyon paid and sign as were leav dipshit waiter guy run up to us claim that one of us me hasnt paid bullshit i said my bill is on the tabl he say no i never saw it so i walk back to the tabl and it under a fuck napkin good job einstein never thought to look there

th servic at this restaur is honest one of the worst servic experi ive ever had i almost feel like becaus we were a parti of nine and gratuiti was automat includ that they just said fuck you were get tip no matter what if im drop that much coin i expect thing to run much more smooth it a shame becaus the food here isnt bad but then again ive had much better for much cheaper i cant imagin ani reason i would ever come back here especi with the multitud of other fine dine option avail in las vegas

and if i ever see that worthless waiter again im gonna punch him in the ballwent in on a sunday afternoon and sat at the bar place was practic empti but still after wait there for about 10 minut to be acknowledg we just got up and left one bartend was total oblivi and the other was too busi have a convo with anoth patron at the other end of the bar we might have wait a bit longer but look to my left the coupl next to us seem like they were tri to get the bartend attent as well and their drink look long gone 

with so mani place to choos from in vega whi settl for shit servic yes i get the concept of dick i live in chicago and have been to the one there mani mani mani time but still when alcohol mean moneyyou better wait on peopl quick or theyll get to steppinsuch as we didare you kid me the first thing i want to do when arriv in vega was to get a drink we saw dick and head over while our room was finish be clean the whole thing is that they treat you like sht i guess some peopl are into that and usual you can tell by who they date me not so much 

basic the peopl refus to answer question like where the bathroom is yell at you throw food at you and complain that there tip wont be enough when you leav peopl also where stupid hat made out of paper that the waiter write rude remark on again peopl like to look like idiot there is a differ between be funni about it and be a complet jerk dick is a jerk 

the food is obvious frozen and heat up just normal chicken strip and that sort of thing noth better than the school cafeteriawalk down las vega blvd on a swelter summer afternoon pass all of these more or less rock bottom price beer and drink place we made the mistak of massiv proport and went into diablo whi it look good from the outsid and it had those two magic word happi and hour

w order two margarita chip and salsa in vega where drink are more or less free the diablo margarita were more like water down 99 cent store lemon lime soda and the chip came with three tini wasabis bowl with nonspici salti green sauc 

the bill 32 i ask isnt this happi hour but my real question should have been happi for who oh and the 32 includ a 4 charg for the chip and salsa wtf when was the last time you paid for chip and salsa uh never 

moral dont judg a book by it cover especi when it call diablo better you go sell your soul somewher elsi came in for lunch with two girlfriend while stay at the mont carlo  we were starv and diablo look pretti cool from the outsid  

i order a shrimp salad which liter had exact 3 shrimp slice in half lengthwis then flip over cut side face down to appear to be 6 shrimp  that howev  is the least of my complaints

on of the girl order taco and ask for tapatio you know a bottl of tapatio  she receiv a side of 3 salsa  when she point out that this wasnt what she want the waitress told her they didnt have ani and walk away ad a 6 charg for the salsa she delivered

mi other friend order a hamburg  it didnt come with mayo so she ask for some  the waitress brought a small side of mayo ad a 3 charg to the bill  notic a pattern here

about halfway through the burger my friend wasnt look so hot she said it tast funni  in an instant there she goe run to the ladi room to vomit it back up  she came back to the tabl  practic green

w report this to our waitress who obvious didnt care at all or apolog  she simpli roll her eye took the burger away and drop off the bill after notic that we had still been charg for the burger in addit to the 6 salsa charg and 3 mayo charg we ask to speak with a manag 

the manag approach our tabl with attitud and befor we could even tell him that the burger made me friend sick he said that he alreadi knew and he tast her burger and it tast fine to me  mayb she threw up becaus of alcohol  i explain that we hadnt start drink yet  it was onli lunch time when i brought up the charg for condiment serious three dollar for mayonnais i told him ive never been charg for condiment at a restau he interupt me and said well we do  i told him they should at least tell peopl instead of just bring it out then ad it to the bill  he snip back oh well i guess you expect me to comp the whole bill then  

i wasnt go to argu with that  yes that would be great  thank you  we threw down some cash for the tip onli and walk out 

id give them a zero rate if i could the food made one of us sick they charg for everyth to pad the bill and the manag that i dealt with was a rude prick i wouldnt go there again if they paid methis place remind me of the new predat movi preview are load in action sequenc and explos and gun fire and sick ass stuff then you watch the movi and 80 of the stuff in the preview never happen or is edit to be rate g

almaza is possibl the wors place ive ever been to theyr under new manag so no booz while paperwork is be push for a liquor licens 

staff are complet moron or high school drop out or their parent didnt social them proper when they were young so they grew up complet frakk idiots

mi parti came earli and request a specif seat and he told us hed get it clean up and it our then his friend walk in and he told us to hold while he devot all his attent to them rememb that seat we were promis anoth group had that spot but he didnt know becaus he learn his custom servic skill from a friggin potato

aft get place to anoth area we wait a good 1520 minut for someon to bring us a menu after we got the menus it took 2030 minut someon to come back and take our order 

the hookah midnight rose flavor was nice and last the few hour we were chill there complet ignor by the staff with empti cup and one mouth pieceseri there 5 peopl at the tabl share a hookah and you onli give one mouth piecenot to who ever manag the staff pleas do not open a tattoo parlor

th pita wrap was the best thing on the tabl and i wasnt the one that order it 
the lamb chop werelet put it this way they were cook earlier in the day then thrown in the fridg when someon like us order it they threw it on the grill to get warm what doe this do it over cook the meat i cant believ i paid 20 buck for rubber on bone

th wors part about this place is they know their servic is garbag and they dont do a gorram thing about it how do i know this where do i draw this conclus from the twentyf percent mandatori gratuiti on the receipt

tip  to insur proper service

tip are earn for be a good server pay attent to your tabl and go abov and beyond in the realm of custom servic as a consum i have a right to withhold a tip if the servic is garbag this place is garbagi use to live down the block from this place and never stop by i mean it seem like a nice spot but i just never got to go but i frequent vega regular and decid to give this place a shot much to my demise

th hookah was mediocr at best ive been to alot better in vega for half the cost i order some food for myself and my date i can honest say the food was decent the server was veri accommod but look back i realiz that they were too accommod youll see whi later then thing went from good to horribl in a matter of a few minutes

aft my meal thing start to chang the server kept urg my date and i to move from the dine section to the hookah section his concern was mayb that we were take up valuabl space and for this i understand but it seem like a rather slow night so i didnt understand the rush they had a dj play hous music i didnt mind sinc i enjoy hous music and it a place like this it realli seem appropri but in all honesti the sound system was absolut horrid i can go into detail about it be somebodi who work in pro audio but let just say that had they hire somebodi decent to set this up theyd been alot better off

but i guess it wasnt their fault becaus at around 10pm the pull the dj from booth liter mind you and they go to the back but not complet out of sight where im assum an argument ensu i turn around and mind my busi smoke subpar hookah but sinc the music was appar done so was my date here

so i ask to close my tab onli to find over 300 charg to my account im told by the manag of the place who is now fluster by the incid with the dj that this was onli an author i was appal a 300 author this is a meal and some drink not a hotel room or rental car i write the amount of the offici bill after ask to see an item one on the slip and signed

wel guess who had to perform a chargeback request that right me this author never got chang at the end of the night and i found myself tri to make the next coupl day away from home on the cash i had on hand 

overal this place is tri to be some posh loung in a desert full of posh loung but serious how posh can you be when your situat next door to a cici pizza

on star for the overal suck of this place had the food been wors this place would get a big gooseegg from me do yourself a favor dont go to this wolf in sheep clothveri shadi place bad servic and drink were in a dirti glass there were guy with gun that seem to work here it is a realli weird place and i didnt feel safe the food was god aw toobarffff i had to updat this review and bump it down to 1 star if i could give 0 i would 

this is in regard to the henderson locat bf and i decid to give this place anoth tri sinc lemongrass had been screw up our order the last coupl time boy did i regret give this place anoth chance

first off the waitress couldnt speak an ounc of english nor understand it i think it took about 5 min go back and forth when i just want to order a rare steak and tendon they didnt have it on the menu my boyfriend final say she want a whatev without the tripe i wish he didnt even say that becaus there was tripe in my soup  i didnt want to bother tell the waitress so i just grin and bear it

th summer roll came out fast but they were so loosley roll everyth was fall out they brought out the plate of bean sprout and basil there was onli one sprig of basil how cheap no spinach like leaf that i like the last time i came here 

the pho came out and the noodl were soooo chewi and stuck togeth that i was get frustrat when eat it wors pho noodl ever the broth wasnt bad but noth special about it either

servic is aw i was surpris they came around to fill my water the worker talk so loud in the same area without ani regard to the custom 

wors pho experi ever will not come back ever againcockroach in my fuck soup stay away im serious fuck sick to my stomach right now they are still tri to charg me even after i show them it float in my soup mind you ive been eat it alreadi i told them im not give them anyth i mean pest control is not that hard and if you have a problem take care of it how dirti doe the back have to be for this to happen never againi swear i never like to leav a bad review base on just the servic ive been to teainfus sever time  not becaus their whack fake boba is that good but to see if everi employe was rude or mayb i caught them on a bad day i understand hemorrhoid headach tummi bubbl and domest issu  i know everyon has a bad day well this place has a freakin black cloud just chillin over it everytim i step in this joint it clear that the person behind the counter feel inconvenienc by have to actual make my order serious im order a chai tea with boba not bake alaska the worst part is im in a pissi mood when i leav the place so i gave it a tri and the onli thing that come to mind treat me like ass onc shame on you treat me like ass twice  shame on me treat me like ass three time and im call you out get a grip tea fusion you are not the onli spot in temp market place your tea is mediocr at best and your boba is not even legit i sincer hope the manag take this review into consider and on one last person note if i get anoth pair of eye roll at me when i walk by the store ill person sit outsid and hand out sampl from paradis bakeri coff bean and juic it up smoothi all of which offer teanot a fan today vermont sandwich compani was pack so my girlfriend and i thought we would walk over and give this place a tri big big mistak now ive been to itali hell i grew up in nice franc not old world enough for me i order the maresciallo italian antipasto with their meat  chees which took forev to get and charg me over 10 big rip off and my friend order a bastard baguett disappoint this place is too overpr in their offerings
th main reason for this yelp is the rude of the staff here the woman behind the counter had a chip on her shoulder and treat not onli us but other in line with arrog also the old man possibl the owner had the same air about him
grant there were mani off duti scottsdal polic hang around but the whole scenario remind me of a mafia front just like back home i guess this is a hit or miss from read all the review mayb it just from other low standardif you were go to build a shop center next to a dri river bed over former garbag dump temp marketplac would be the result

th hast and hast of architectur firm must be respons for this one  we special in park lot surround by store  our idea of curb appeal is big honk steel sign to attract the eye of  peopl in car move 70 mile per hour  we also work with your communiti to ensur the drive to our facil is not a straight shot  if our shop center doesnt look signific date in 10 year we havent done our job

mi famili is tire of me mention how much i dislik temp marketplac everytim we pass it on the 202ive never eaten at koi but they deserv one star for the terribl new year eve parti they threw this year  

they oversold their 80 ticket and the open bar was a 40 minut wait for a drink if you have boob which i dont  

it was absolut so miser that we left and spent time on the crowd dirtyass strip instead  but befor we left i went down to the casino floor to grab a drink and the bouncer gave me a bunch of crap and wouldnt let me take it in even though they were not actual sell alcohol insid but give it away at the open bar and know full well that the bar wait was at least 40 minut  i still had a good time parti with my friend but this place had absolut noth to do with that enjoyment

sham on you koi shameive seen this place from the bus and now the light rail when come into work for a while now  friday i got stuck work veri late and my boss took me to dinner when we were done with our project as a thank you

sh want someth mexican and close to the offic  she said that she love this place so she took me here  walk in i like the decor of this place  authent look and seem cute  that where the niceiti stop

w walk in and were seat  the servic was absolut horrif  i was blatent ignor but my boss was wait on as if she were the queen  i have a theori about whi but i dare not write it down here for fear of backlash  i had to scream at the server halfway across the restur when he refus to take my drink order  i was astound  when he took my order it was as if he were do me a favorhorrible

food was hot  so spici that i was unabl to eat it  whi cant they state that in thier menu  my  boss thought it was hyster becaus i turn 7 shade of red from the spicy  lol  anyway the next day the food was better from my fridg i just wasnt expect a mouth full of spici hot food  lol

anyway i will not be return to this craptast shithol  never again  servic was awe and the food was just way to spici for me  i can get mexican food just as decent with substanti better servic at a spice level i can handl at about a zillion differ place in this town

stay away from this place it horriblservic was slowno refil never check back had to wait for check

pizza was pretti good crispi toppings

park was not too bad park around the corner

too bad for the aw servic here mayb they need to switch to place your order at the counter with a cashier and get rid of the food serverit pain me extrem to give amor onli 3 star  we have been go toorder from here veri often for over a year even when i was diagnos with celiac and had to go glutenfre i wait patient onli order chicken vesuvio until they recent start carri glutenfre product  

now i realiz when order in i take the risk of be contamin but thank not onli am i veri awar  but as well am a bit paranoid  i have never had a problem order from there gluten or otherwis until tonight  i order glutenfre pasta and receiv the complet opposit in wheat  i call question and it was treat nonchal as if a pizza arriv with wrong top rather than the fact i was almost poison which would land me in the hospit immedi  not onli were they complet flippant about what just happen i even need to be the one to bring up about be refund  after a brief verbal brawl i final just gave the phone back to the deliveri guy sinc he was yell for it back he gave us our refund and i hand him back the remad meal there was no way i was eat their food ever again

a i said befor i hate deduct star from a place i love so much but if them give me wheat pasta wasnt bad enough they show littl to no remors to a veri frequent custom  not cool  not to mention even if  it didnt work out for me to eat there again and feel comfort i have a veri hungri boyfriend whose alway enjoy the tast of their foodlll until the truth of their person came out

upd this review has gone down to 1 star after be treat in such a poor manner by the managerown  he truli lost me as a custom when he said i onli order this stuff for you poeopl  and continu on state that he would take if off if he could  i have never thought the bigotri i would endur in life would be becaus of an ill which limit what i can eat  shame on this place  i could have becom serious ill from their mistak and his onli respons was a chuckl say what am i suppos to sign off on all glutenfre item that leav the kitchen  no jackhol you are suppos to educ your staff when you take on the respons of serv a veri larg communiti of peopl who are do this not by choic but for survivadmit i was unabl to actual eat here but my review might explain

w arriv about 7pm to a pretti full restaur good sign that a good meal is ahead  although there is no sign ask us to wait or seat ourselv we wait up front to be be sure  after about 5 minut we decid it must be seat yourself as not one person from the staff who eye us sever time approach us to help  

as i head for one of the three empti tabl a man appear out of the kitchen and say can i help you  

sure i repli wed like a seat  he repli well sit up front and wait there are no tabl quick follow by did you call ahead everybodi know to call ahead were a busi place

it at that point we decid to liber ourselv from the rude and eat elsewher  im sorri i didnt know the amor rule perhap they should post them somewher  im happi they are so success but i do draw the line at treat your custom rude becaus your busiafter all the posit review the hubbi  i decid to check it out upon enter everyth look great the place is spacious and we were greet and seat immedi 

i order the cajun comb and my husband got the tilipia while were wait for our meal to arriv our waiter offer us fresh bake bread right out of the oven not want to fill up on bread we declin were still sit there when a roach scurri arcoss the ledg near our booth all bug freak me out my husband said it wasnt that big a deal and i should just calm down the tabl next to us receiv their food a coupl of minut befor us as soon as the waiter sat the food on the tray fli swarm i tri not to freak out but i was realli get uneasi about the safeti of our food final our food come out a coupl of minut later and im eyebal it like a hawkno fli touch it but it didnt stop them from tri to attack our food onc it arriv it hard to enjoy your meal while your swat away fli and make sure roach are come up behind you 

on to the food my fish was salti and my husband was butteri 2 perfect good piec of fish were ruined

whil i went to the restroom my hubbi order a slice of keylim pie for me the pie was delici our waiter was great the peopl watch is extrem interest but we will never return hereit sad that this pasqual even share the same name as the one on monro st becaus if this were my onli pasqual experi id never go back  

i use to love the old atwood locat and the monro one is good too  this newest addit just suck  first off it big and dark yet like an old factori  huh

th food select is slight differ than the pasqual on monro street too  just weird stuff  and what is with the bakerycoffe shop  the tabl setup is strang too  everi tabl is awkward and the place is cold

just do yourself a favor and dont go hereif this restaur were in a differ place with a differ wait staff this would be a five star review all the way the food is except good

but let start out our dine experi with get to the restaur the websit state that it across the street from the monorail technic it is it also about two sketchi block down sahara is it me or has the area surround the strip realli becom rundown over the past 10 year my colleagu were look at me like what kind of crappi restaur are you take us to as we made the trek when we walk in it look like a place that onc upon a time was a nice place but it struggl to keep up with the times

then there the servic a smarmi knowit all maitr dwaiter took care of us dont ask him for anyth that not on the menu he will yell at you the rest of the wait staff look like they walk in from the set of goodfella you got the feel that these guy had screw up everyth they had ever done so they were thrown into the restaur where they could presum do less damag so we had bread thrown onto our plate and were constant be growl at when we werent listen to the maitr berat the staff for do thing wrong at ani moment i expect gordon ramsey to walk in and start film kitchen nightmar call this guy a donkey and march him outsid to cuss him out

but the truli bizarr moment came when our custom who i will admit is chines and her english is fair but not great ask if she could have a salad as an appet smarmi guy got downright rude and told her no we dont serv those we will give you a veget plate custom look at us quit perplex our intern sale manag tri to explain that the ladi would like a salad and perhap you could prepar one for her alright fine sinc you dont understand how we do thing well just do this now and pull out a giant basket of veget and some dijon vinaigrett to dip it in there now are you happi  sever awkward minut after we had our fill he return to take our order

th entre and soup were nice had the servic not been so aw we might have a better feel about this place the much hype chocol lava cake was overcook so there was no molten center it was a poor end to a comic meal 

15 year ago when my boss last dine here this was a fantast restaur but like the neighborhood it in it in declinwow where to begin i guess at the begin ok so im a chef from san diego in town leav tomorrow and rememb i had a groupon i need to use befor i left in the morn so i   made my reserv at 430 for 530 on a sunday night and explain i had a groupon the maitr explain 6 would be better or the kitchen and i figur no problem plan was app and wine to start had a big late lunch but we want some munchi for one last all night run at crap and roulett upon arriv i notic the park lot was full so we  girlfriend and i  were excit becaus we figur full lot mean great place we were seat by keifer  the maitr  into a small corner i didnt mind there was tinsel hung on all the wall the place remind me of a kitchen nightmar episod but again i want to see the menu i look at the menu and know my girlfriend tast so i order for us perri  the beyond pompous waiter took our order of foie gras fettuccin ala georg and french onion soup and a stella he ask  all appet  i said  yes sir  think noth of it he whip himself around quit flamboy and proceed to walk away i thought noth of it nor was i made awar of ani issu 

a few moment later keifer brought out my gfs stella to the wrong tabl and be that i was so close to the tabl next to us i heard him mention someth about you cant just order 3 appet my girlfriend caught it aswel and we knew they were talk about us perri proceed to come behind keifer veri quick and hiss someth about that the wrong tabl and as they walk to the back the look like 2 children argu an make a scene in what is alreadi a small place we were laugh at their behavior it was embarrass for both of them but perri was the one heard throughout the place  i cant be 2 place at onc  realli priceless lol so we now realiz there was an issu perri was too afraid to bring up to us so he ask keifer to take care of it 

now keifer come over all red face and sweati from embarrass w the stella to the correct tabl and tri to explain we either have to order an entre a 5 cours or a 4 cours prefix menu in order to use the groupon i tri to explain it was fine we didnt need to use the groupon and it was all good but he kept tri to sell me on his  wonder salad that come w the pre fix menu  lol i tri to explain again we werent hungri for main we want to tri the app and be on our way but again he was insist we order main or the pre fix he was insist  there has to be a balanc in the bill  which i though was funni becaus i had alreadi told him we didnt need to use the groupon by this time i was insult embarrass and about to get angri the guy open the menu on my charger plate stood next to me and walk me thru the menu  wtf im a grown man i can read lol  so i told him wed glad pay for the beer and be on our way keifer explain the beer was on the hous and there would be no charg so i said  i thought there had to be a balanc on the bill 

mi girlfriend was more insult than i was so she left the full beer there 

ive been in the food biz for 13 year never have i seen anyth so mishandl 

a whi not address the issu of a main cours befor or while im make my order i told you twice i had a groupon 

b after explain we would pay for it out of pocket would you continu to tri to sell me someth i emphat refus 

c whi didnt the manag word the ad more care this is the fine print 


reserv requir dinein onli must purchas a food item parti must have 2 peopl or more for 50 option 4 peopl or more for 100 option not valid for onlin booking

i think 3 app constitut a  food item  whi not write  an entre must be includ in purchas  or  there must be a remain balanc after youv use the coupon in order to use this coupon  it pretti simpl  

bottom line 1 star becaus i cant give 0 yelp wont allow it the food was probabl great but ill never know cuz ill never go back and ill tell everyon i know everywher i can no to either thank for read happi dinomfg how doe this place stay in busi 

soi decid to tri a new pizza joint near my hous and you would think summerlin upper neighborhood i see peopl go in and out all the time and the place look decent how bad can you screw up pizza right 

welllet me tell you 

you walk in and place your order and they charg you 50 cent per toppl for pizza by the slice onc you pay you slide over and watch them make the pizza and they pull out a precook cardboard crust chees alreadi melt and begin to add your top oni should have stop them there and ask for my money back but i didnt want to be rude 

onc i got home and open the box i saw uncook top on all the slice on a cardboard crust with cheap crappi chees i had to throw it back into the oven at home so i know the pizza was cook and safe to eat

1st slice meatbal uncook
2nd slice ham and the pineappl look like it just came out of a can
3rd pepperoni look decent but still uncooked
4th mushroom and olivesuncook and it came out of a salad bar on to my pizzayuck

i knew i should have just demand for my money back but was scare to ask becaus the manag was rip one of her employe a new one right in front of mei was afraid to ask

i wouldnt call myself a connoisseur of food or pizza but i know bad food i realli know bad pizzaisnt it against yelp polici to write your own review who ever gave this place 4 to 5 star is beyond me 

littl caesar or digiorno is 10x better than this place

i would never step foot into this place again and you shouldnt either 

i will post a pictur of what my slice look like

they serv food till midnight so we roll through here at 11 pm on a first friday 

the waiter kept forget thing we ask for water menus etc

th wine list was pretti shallow other friend order some fruiti tart type flavor white wine she said it was tinni tast and not good fail

th pool tabl take up way too much room such that it imposs to sit around the wall and not be poke by stick after be poke 3x by this daft fool i tap the back of his cue ball and mess up his shot on purpos becaus i was about to get it in the rib 

the paint of the queen and churchil kind of suck in a 7th grade kind of way it look like queen es hair is float slight abov her head 

i will not be backnot a pleasant experience
i like to find the posit in most anyth but tri to do that for this locat of famous ray pizza is go to be a challeng  we went in becaus jare was crave a slice or two of pizza and we were head north for the weekend  at other pizza joint around town you can liter walk in and choos your slice from the counter and it is readi to go not the case here

jar order his slice and i order what i thought would be a grill chicken salad  side note  jare question the girl take our order about what kind of meat and chees they use for their sandwich and she had no idea  he want to hear boar head but he got a clueless express instead  anyway back to our order

not onli could he not choos his slice but we wait a good 10 minut for the slice and the salad which would be ok if the food were good  unfortun the pizza was realli greasi and the salad came with fri chicken not grill as i thought and not onli fri but fri with a huge piec of hair insid it gross

sinc i did say i tri to find the posit i will say that when we made the restaur awar of the hair in the salad they offer to replac it give us a pizza or give us our money back i was surpris when jare said it ok just rememb us next time were back  i think he felt bad needless to say we will not be go back anytim soon  free pizza or notto say that the servic is pathet would not accur quantifi how bad this place suck  i have been here twice now both time on friday night with jen as the bartend on my last visit tonight she spoke to me onc dure the hour i was at the bar to get my drink order

onc she had my order she went back to the activ that i obvioulsi interupt her from talk with her friend  unfortun one of said friend was sit next to me and i was unabl to avoid overhear some of the thing come out of her mouth  i realli thought i was at a marin corp bar in san diego grotesqu languag  not to mention cast expurs on quit a few custom after they left i can onli imagin what was said about me

i see these good review i was even check them from my phone while i was in there and i made it a point to check in to make sure i was in the right spot  the review i read do not accur reflect the servic i saw this even  for one most of them are quit old but two tell me what day to go in becaus i need to wit servic from this dive to believ it exists

i will not be back beyond that i would steer a friend far clear  especi in this neighborhood  there are 15 other bar within a milei came here twice in one week for teppanyaki  but i will never come back after the second time the first time i came here my experi was so awesom the chef wasnt that good at do his littl trick but he was still entertain it was dure normal hour and i fell in love with their fri rice and mushroom 
three day later i came realli late at night dure their happi hour we order about the same amount food like last time the server told us it 50 off so we get half the portion but it the same exact food as the normal menu so we order twice as much 

here come the chef who look at us like great some of my custom are 12 year old just becaus we look young doesnt mean you start downgrad your servic i despis server like that and yes we do look like 12 year old i told him twice befor he start that no onion on ani of our food my bf is allerg and he said im go to put lot of onion he said it in a joke way but i said it again after just to be sure he start do his thing and he cook fri rice for the other custom first with onion and then he use to same grill to cook our fri rice without clean it the previous chef we had was not like that he acknowledg our request and he put us first our fri rice had onionsgood thing were smart enough to check he got even wors when it came to the veggi he cook the veggi all at onc for everybodi and gave us veggi with onion then he goe it might have a littl onion after that i was so done i wasnt go to complain anymor becaus to me this restaur doesnt exist i was plan on take my famili here for my graduat dinner but no thank he didnt even give us ani mushroomsh gave all the mushroom to everybodi els i love mushroom i thought we were suppos to get the exact same thing as regular menu we paid the same amount we did for the regular menu i hate this place with a burn passion pleas train your chef what no onion mean and how to provid serviclost my daughter 12th birthday dinner reserv made no attempt to fix it or attend to us anyway ignor us laugh at us when we insist they made a mistak lost my busi forev and that sadden me becaus the food is decent noth make up for mess up a kid birthday she was truli disappoint as were the other 7 peopl in our parti you realli screw us musashi and i will never return nor will i refer you to anyon ever againthis was a rare occas where i have had to walk out of an establish i was seat to have dinner at without eat this was on st patrick day night in which as tradit i took my mom out for corn beef and cabbag we decid to visit this locat as they were serv a corn beef and cabbag dinner

long stori shorti our corn beef and cabbag dinner come out and the beef is tough and overcook as can be we both took a bite of our meal and it was imposs to attempt to eat it was so bad

so we inform the server and show her that not even the knife would cut through it
sh say oh no but we have been serv it all night i am think in my head realli ladi well i am look at two shoe insol on my plate right now the server then state well whi dont i have the chef come out and explain the meal to you

wtf what is to explain what is in front of me is ined i dont care what kind of stori he tell me about it i am not eat it final answer and i find it hard to believ that other had not complain about it or sent it back so she final take the plate away and we left as agre without pay we drove over here from across town special for this meal and i resent be put in that posit to have to leav over someth like this not cool

nev again cross the lodg off of my list which is too bad becaus the locat we ate at seven year ago on ft apach had an amaz corn beef and cabbag dinner we call them this year and were inform they were not particip so that is how we end up at this locatwell all i can say is the chicken wing we order were still half frozen when serv to us we told the server he reach onto our plate and grab a wing off of it then say yea your right let me tell the cook he come back out and take anoth wing off the plate to check if theyr all cold at this point i dont want ani of the food on the plate after his hand have been in it the nacho were veri um creativ they had can stew tomato stew tomato gross  i ask for a greyhound with kettl one which was basic ocean spray white grapefruit juic no kettl one 

so in close id say avoid this place go next door to roberto you have a better chanc of get decent nachoim surpris to see all the great review for this place  i think it terribl in mani ways

i work across the street and my cowork and i often head over to the az center for happi hour weve tri 1130 a few time and each time leav disappoint this place tri to be more than it is and charg a pretti penni for it mediocr food and horribl servic ive been in there when there are onli 2 other tabl fill in the entir place and not seen my waiter for 20 minut my glass empti and my group readi for anoth round

on our last trip we got there 10 minut befor they start happi hour  they wouldnt serv us at happi hour price so we said come back in 10 minut then most place ive been will glad serv you and just wait to punch in the order in a few minut but 1130 was not interest in do this so after 10 minut no waiter 25 minut no waiter some goofi dude came out after a while and told us our waiter was get dress and would be right out anoth 10 minut later she made her way out and we final got our order in

when she brought our beer  2 8th street 2 blue moon she hand us the glass  who doe that everi place ive ever been sit them on the tabl rather than awkward hand them to you risk spill it all over you what wors is the pint glass werent even full they look as though our late dress waitress had taken a fat gulp out of them on her way to our table

w also order some calamari luckili it was happi hour so it was 12 way afford but it was heavi on the garnish and few on the calamari there were 4 of us and you know how it is when you share an ap nobodi want to be the one to finish it  well our waitress final made her way back to our tabl after i had an empti glass for over 10 minut and without ask took the plate of calamari for rude paw off ladi ask first befor grab at our food 

overal this place is tri to be way more than it actual is it way overpr for what you get the servic is horrend  and i say that onli after give it sever tri it might be an okay place to grab a drink it is cozi afteral but even at 325 happi hour pint it aint cheap i just dont see it last long at that locatslowest servic in phoenix great bloodi mari mix salti stale food what a waste

excel bloodi mari and for 2 special satsun 11a3p one star up from zero for an excel drink that it

walk in to find a custom at the podium wait to complain about be abandon at his patio tabl for the last 30 minutes
wait 15 minut for our first round of drink in the bar
when our parti join us and we sat wait 10 minut to have our drink order taken
25 more minut for our drink to arriv we insist she take our order befor leaving
food arriv more than one hour after ordering
th scrambl egg were crusti and old obvious made hour earlier we were too hungri and pissi to send them back  get me the hell out of here
th lobster bit and their sauc were noth but salt a salt lick would have been less salty

gratu was automat ad forc upon us despit the delay and with no apologies
no park valid avail they said they ran out what

if i ever go back ill go straight to the bar and hope for quicker servic on a bloodi mari by itself i probabl wonthow is this place still open tri it numer time simpli for the geograph conveni everi time the food is horribl last experi includ gross bloodi mari not work the two buck an overcook  and under season salmon soggi greasi fri and bad servic 

i will not come back heredo not go here  it use to be tast of india or someth like that  i went out of my way on a week basi to go there  until just last weekend  ugh  the pakoori were plain old fri veggi  the chicken tikka masala had chunk ofsometh white  the chicken itself seem ok how can you screw up tandoori but i will never ever go there agin
n corner 32nd st and greenway
sighman this place was so disappoint i was tri to think of a place to eat breakfast this morn and this place pop into my head i dont know whi i think i had heard of it from someon but anyway we were in the neighborhood so we went 

that was the mistak 

we wait outsid for about 20 minut which wasnt so bad consid this place was on tv and whatnot we got seat over by the wall realli close to the peopl next to us the place was loud and the person sit next to me was yell the whole time did not stop we were basic sit at the same tabl as this person so that was annoy not the restaur fault though 

so i order the chicken and waffl at the waiter recommend and the bf order pancak and bacon we both order coffe 225 for a cup of drip coffe how do they charg so much the coffe wasnt terribl not great but not bad kind of metal also we didnt get a second refil on the coffe cup stood empti the waiter brought out a tini thing of half and half but never refil it the coffe was much wors without cream our food came quick the chicken was a fri breast on top of a thin waffl the chicken actual had decent flavor but the waffl was complet tasteless soggi and detract from the overal flavor of the food useless calori  so my food was not terribl but not good by ani mean and for 9 it should have been good the real reason for the one star was the bfs pancak wtf these pancak were terribl they had no flavor and they were dri as could be these pancak were not as good as bisquick at home they were not as good as the pancak at mcdonald they were not as good as those frozen pancak that you microwav how did they make pancak so bad at a popular breakfast place no less in addit the syrup was in a squeez bottl on the tabl not heat up or anyth the syrup was flavorless as well mrs butterworth is better so gross and the bacon 4 was so small 3 wimpi soggi slice that were not at all crispi then i got the bill 25 wow this place has some nerv charg that much for this poor excus of a breakfast 

never again i would go get a frozen breakfast from the groceri store befor i would come get food here againim tremend disappoint with over easi this is the type of breakfast dive even featur on diner drivein  dive that im usual in love with ive heard such good thing but thank to less than stellar food and underwhelm servic over easi feel like it qualiti is under medium 

with a free tuesday morn and a 20 for 10 gift certif from local dine httpwwwlocaldinescomref19485 my girlfriend and i decid to skip the usual egg andor cereal breakfast and give over easi a tri 

mi girlfriend order an omelet with chicken pepper mushroom and caramel onion first problem with the omelet it wasnt an omelet omelet are suppos to be light fluffi and fold this came out as just a big scrambl the next problem they use raw onion instead of caramel she sent it back and explain that she hate raw onion when it came back it was clear obvious that the cook simpli caramel some onion and threw it in with the origin omelet so the raw onion she doesnt like were still in the alleg omelet it also come with potato on the side the potato were pretti mushi when they should have been crispi she couldv sent it back again but what the point after just a coupl bite she gave up on it

sh also had an over easi ice coffe there was noth special about this specialti coffe tast like folger with cream and cinnamon no tast from the cardamom and mint that was suppos to be in there 

i had the selina it a breakfast burrito not bad but not anyth special again the potato which are insid the burrito are mushi so there is no textur to it and none of the ingredi tast fresh so it seem like someth i couldv microwav up from fresh and easi 

we also had the 12 order of caramel banana  pecan brioch french toast i was truli expect someth mind blow and it was anyth but while it kind of tast like a banana foster it also tast like it couldv use anoth minut on the griddl 

they had no problem take the omelet off the check but it took forev to get that check we were also kind of surpris that a manag never came by to see how everyth was after we sent food back i left stuf but disappoint my girlfriend left unhappi and hungry

th tabl be right on top of each other dont realli help we could easili see and hear that the other coupl sit behind us was also have issu with the food and servic it also probabl isnt a good thing that the peopl next to us could hear us talk about how disappoint we were an open kitchen probabl isnt the brightest idea either we could see quit a few obvious healthcod violat 

with the local dine certif our total came to about 5 dollar with tip that pretti much the onli way id recommend go to over easiyou know i have eaten at liliana mani time and they have some veri good food but i dont know that ive ever had wors servic than what my famili and i experi last night when we tri to enjoy a meal notic the emphasi on tri from the veri begin the servic wasnt great it took a long time to even get some water much less some drink on top of that we had to ask 4 time for a children menu we never receiv it and instead got a brief list of some of the item on the children menu

aft final get our drink we order our meal our appet came out relat quick as did the children meal then we wait and wait then we start to notic food come out to peopl who came in after us not onli had we not seen our meal but we also hadnt been offer drink refil we ask our server what was go on the first excus was im at the whim of the execut chef   oh so the execut chef is determin who get food and not the order that peopl order  interest so we wait some more  

more time goe by and we ask about our food again becaus now were see peopl who came in 2030 minut after us pay their bill and leav  this time the server has no excus or even an estim timelin and instead offer us some drink  i would have even accept a lie about what happen and while i understand that peopl order differ item and some thing take longer than other none of us order complic menu item and that doesnt excus have peopl sit for almost two hour without have their meal serv to them  final as we approach the two hour mark we all decid we had had enough and told them we want to pay the bill and leav the server did me the favor of drink and meal are on them  realli   what meal   if my meal are on the hous then can i pleas have them

so we left and sorri liliana but you lost our patronagterribl food and service

i have been to just about everi strip steak place and this is hand down my least favorit and not just by a littl bit by a rather larg margini love steak and i love french so this should have been a match made in heaven perhap how much i look forward to go here taint my view but it was so bad it cant all have been my bias just look at my review record i have enver given 1 star to anyth els i am a pretti soft judge


first my reception

i had just spent an inordin amount of time play poker at the venetian as such i was not dress super formal khaki short polo shirt tenni shoe more than accept for vega lunch this is on a wed about 230pm the host  a dude ignor me for about 5 minut while he is on the phone than final reluct bring me to a tabl it is then about 20 minut befor i see my waiter dure this wait i am drink some water and happen to empti my glass the water guy come up and start pour the water befor the pitcher is over the glass and miss the glass for a solid 3 second soak the entir tabl and myself befor he notic i ask to move to a dri tabl he tell me mayb at this point i look around i am one of 6 peopl in the entir place eventu i get moved

mi order
i tri to get the exact same thing my first time at everi steak hous here for comparison bone in ribey potato side tartar the waiter come up to my tabl and i tri and get my order in as quick as possibl sinc i have alreadi been wait

him im not sure we have that
m which part
him uh the potato

it onli went downhil from there he didnt write anyth down came back twice to ask to clarifi and then brought tuna tartar the tuna was actual the highlight of the day

th steak
i like steam rare to medium rare that be said i will eat just about anyth the steak that was brought to me was not even grey it was so dark grey throughout i doubt if it was actual meat it look like an overcook mcdonald hamburg insid i first cut a piec off the end and decid to give them the benefit of the doubt mayb it wasnt like that in the middl it was 

now a quick note about me i dont realli ever send food back im a gambler and i think order food is sort of a gambl in this case i gambl and lost also if a kitchen has alreadi screw someth up i dont have much faith in them fix it so general i just let it go

and that is what i plan to do here so my waiter come back and say how is everyth the follow convers ensues

m the steak is way overcook it ined can i get my check
him it look fine to me

ok that annoy still never argu with stupid peopl right

m just the check please
him ill bring that right out

15 minut later the waiter come back with anoth waiter

new waiter im sorri sir we cannot send that back it look medium rare to me 

at this point i am flabbergast was i get punk could i actual be eat in a profession restaur let alon a nice one in las vega could anyon work in a steakhous for longer than 3s of minut think this was medium rare

m im not tri to send it back i just want my check

anoth 10ish minut go by and i get my check i choos to pay by way of the credit card i put it in the littl wallet thing and stand it up so all can see the card stick out of it at this point i look at my watch and think to myself how long could this take turn out quit a while after anoth 10 minut i look around and i cant see ani other custom in the place i take my check and walk to the front where the host and 34 waiter are sit in the bar area i ask my waiter to run my card which he sigh and then doe also they charg me for the tenderloin tartar which is 1 dollar more than the tuna

i then walk outsid across the street and ate at stripburger

in close carn vino greater than morelive never had a wors experi at a restaur than i had hereeven mcdonald would have been better we came here as a last resort becaus the breakfast club was overcrowd and ive heard they have great mimosa and bloodi mari which was exact what we were look for i tend not to dine in scottsdal at these kind of place becaus of the overtan oversteroid bejeweledwear snotti environ 

first off there was a long wait  we were offer a free round of drink on the hous becaus of thisth bartend was new so when we order she neglect to tell us about the differ kind of mimosa and bloodi mari they offerand they are onli 2 until 3pm which was a pretti slick deal tri the fallen angel bloodi mari it made with chipoltl and jalepeno delicious

whil we were wait a group of the typic scottsdal bitch and bros walk in and just decid to seat themselv like they own the fuckin place while we kind sat and wait and dont even get me start on how mani dirti look my girlfriend and i got while we were waitingugh

w final got seat after 30 min of wait and our waitress was veri friend and apologet about the whole situat we order the breakfast sandwhich and steak and egg the food didnt come out for 45 minut forti five fuck minut the tabl of bitch and bros even got serv way befor us and the food was cold and my bacon was not how i order it my girlfriend had them remak her dish which took like 15 minut and they still left off my bacon we got offer free shot and had sever peopl come up to us and offer their condol what the fuck ever there is no excus for shitti servic like we receiv 

they end up comp our food but we still had to pay for drink and dessert the cooki with peanut butter was alright the main bartend told us he was go to get us anoth drink on the hous and never came back with it the managerown also claim he would be back with a card for us and never came back with that

it was also so fuck loud in there there was a footbal game and they had the volum turn up so high i couldnt even hear my girlfriend speak and she was sit right next to me 

i was look for a cure for my hangov with steak egg and a bloodi mari and this place just made it that much wors and ruin my first day of the new year

th kind crackhead buy at 711 for a buck fiddy

th endworst experi ever at a bar 

mi friend and i stop by after grab lunch elsewher in the marketplac we had just order our first beer and start talk to a coupl at the bar next to us the guy joke attach 4 straw togeth and was tri to drink out of his date cup the bartend grab the straw pull them apart and threw them away without make ani eye contact with ani of us 
shock we told her she was veri rude and that it was complet uncal for she immedi cut all four of us off and told us to leav 
we ask for the manag who was in his earli thirti overweight and a complet underachiev nerd name ryan he said he stand behind his waitress regardless of what happen i told him i would ruin him on yelp and he repli yelp is worthless nobodi read it anyway 
other than that the bottl beer tast freshwe decid to check out san felip to satisfi a fish taco crave it alway look pretti busi have walk by on other occas  sinc we were plan on see a movi it seem convenient

w shouldv follow our instinct and turn around when we saw the skankili dress and over made up waitress smoke outsid the back door

w were given the option of insid bar or outsid we opt for outsid and love the cell call servic for when the tabl was readi there was no mention or indic of there be a band on the patio   the hostess put us on the same side of a sticki picnic tabl we had to move a coupl of smoker who were sit on top of the tabl befor we could sit down note we had toth hostess did not at that point we realiz a band was about to start play  luckili we were abl to get price and place a drink order befor the screech started

th drink and our appet of chip and salsa came quick but our water did not  the music was so loud we couldnt even focus on read the menu  we ask to be move insid and the waitress oblig the hostess also the manag came out to move us and made it clear in her facial express that we were sever inconvenienc her she took us insid and i caught her roll her eye at a waitress as she reseat us 

about 15 minut later we final had a waitress approach us dure this time we had discuss drop some money on the tabl and leav but we were too hungri and figur the experi could onli get better from here  we couldnt have been more wrong

first request the water we hadnt gotten yet  we immedi place our order and it came out about 10 minut later  it was drop by a sur food runner with zero person water  still miss  i was stuck sip my weak margarita and by boyfriend had near finish his beer

when we were halfway done with our lukewarm meal the waitress came to check on us  was she carri water  nope  final she follow through on someth and brought them

dur this time we were subject to the horribl music come in from outsid  im fair certain the band singer was both tone deaf and unabl to keep a beat  i have heard better music at last call in a backwood karaok bar

th baja sauc was disgust it basic water down mayo with a littl hot sauc mix in  i shouldv taken to heart their sign that said if  the food doesnt meet your standard lower your standards

wel we finish our meal and wait for our checkfor near 25 minut between the bad music bad food and bad servic we near left without pay it clear nobodi wouldv notic  sinc we have manner i got up and ask the 4 waitress stand around at the entri for our check sinc our was mia they scurri off and i assum they were find her  after anoth 10 minut she final show up with the check 

and she had the nerv to say see you guy next time never again  save your time save your money save your ear drum avoid san felip cantinait was not my decis to come here i just want to make that clear befor i start this review 

im go to keep this review relat short becaus i dont have anyth nice to say about this place varieti of food not impress at all in fact it was kind of depress see that this was all they had even though it was lunchtim the food was so veri disappoint and even say that is an understat the dessert were cute that one nice thing i have to say but i took a big spoon of one of the dessert one bite and that thing came fli out into a napkin it  was so disgust that i actual gag and sat there for a coupl of minut and tri to keep myself from throw up

cost around 16 for lunch sure it cheap but save your stomach and pleas choos anoth buffet to eat at i knew i should have check yelp befor agre to come herei cannot believ this nation chain get away with the deplor condit that are found in this store custom clear dont care about how they treat the merchandis and themselv and employe couldnt give less than a shit either i came here last night and the number of peopl in there with unhappi tire toddler it was 930 pm astound me there was an unusu high number of the undertwentyfiveyearsoldwithtwoorthreesmallchildren type too check out was a joke as we were in the shortest line but behind a famili of three that each rang up their purchas as two separ transact per person but the worst part was in the men packag undershirt section there was an odor in that aisl that was just indescrib d thought it was a hidden dirti diaper i disagre becaus as a human be i happen to know what a turd smell like and this was not a turd it was like a halfrot corps extract from the scottsdal waterfront river 
on a side note i notic that some other bad review includ mention of minor let me just say that there were a lot of unwash peopl in this store and they werent the minorguess what i just got back from mexico and it onli it took me 5 minut to get there everytim i have to go to this walmart no less than 10 daylabor run out to my truck wave their arm as if just becaus i drive a truck mean im look for worker 

ughand the store itselfit so sad look the park lot is litter with plastic bag cup just garbag in general and even at it busiest they absolut refus to open more than 2 regist doesnt matter if the line are 50 custom deepsorri onli 2 regist open the shelv are a mess noth line up to the correct price so that coffe maker you thought was 25 buck wind up be 45 buck becaus it on the wrong shelf 

play a game next time you go here see how mani misplac object you can find throughout the storefor instancea sirloin steak in the shoe depart or a bath rug in the electron depart or a bag of garden soil in the women lingeri depart 

ah butlik the air i breath i cant live without walmartlook through the photo that were upload for this particular crapmart you cant help but notic that some woman upload a photo of herself wear gaudi bright color makeup that look like itd been appli with a trowel  and look at her yelp account youll notic that she doesnt actual write review she just upload photo of herself in various ghetto pose to random busi  

have you ever notic that on the side of all photograph yelp alway ask if the photo is

befor we sat at our tabl we had a nice glass of prosecco at the bar with a veri affabl bartend  it look like we were in for a great nightuntil we got seat with a server who was part use car salesman part annoy high school substitut teacher  this guy proceed to go through and lectur us on the menu for liter 10 minutesw can read guy and we get it you want us to order the most expens steak you offer  this server i use this term veri loos becaus we didnt get his name proceed to tell us that we shouldnt consid the filet or the fish dish realli batali put item on his menu that arent good and that the side arent like ruth chris you cant just order them  what doe that even mean  so after mention that they keep mani of the item in italian to encourag a dialogu we knew that this was one strang place  
the night befor my vegetarian friend suggest i get the buccatini without the pork and she recommend i get the small size which is liter enough for one person but i should have been tip off when they said theyll tri and push the big size  ok im a vegetarian and even though im go to a place call meat  wine im allow to be there and eat what i like  so after ask for the buccatini san pork he look and me and said he wouldnt do itif we start take thing out of our dish itll just get strang and i dont want to put a plate of strang in front of you  ill be the judg of strang buddi and dont bs me becaus my friend order it last night  he wouldnt take my order and said ill come back to you  what happen to the dialogu he promis earlier  needless to say he hassl everyon of my friend about our order say zinger like that just 5 bite and wont be enough you have to get all of your order in now becaus itll just get awkward if you want more food later  after we order we all decid to leav becaus we were made to feel so uncomfort  these server must be work on commiss 
i spoke to the matr on the way out who to his credit was veri apologet and flabbergast the waiter wouldnt adher to my vegetarian request  he offer to seat us in anoth section  we just want to get out of this boiler room so he paid for our drink  if this restaur want to surviv they need to chill out on the hard sell and let peopl order size and portion they feel comfort with  even though i wasnt get a steak for 2 i would have drank for twoive been to las vega about 11 time i understand and appreci the opportun to make reserv at these high end restaur or els you dont get seat 

i made the reserv gave my cc over the phone about a week in advanc for dinner on a tuesday night for 4 
we show up for our tabl and they said it would be a bit becaus they dont have room  in fact there were multipl other parti await for their 8pm reserv and here we stand wait past 830 
this is unaccept  we made reserv for 4 more than 6 day in advanc and flew to las vega for a special dinner and here we stand  hungri 30 minut past our confirm time and the staff did not care  they werent even phase by the situat as if were a normal occurr 
this is not okay 

i have not eaten here  at this point i might never give them my busi i made reserv they call me and confirm the day of and then when we show up they had no tabl and we ate elsewhere

thank you for spoil my reserv carnevino  thank you1 wine took 30 minut to get to the table
2 waiter was more interest in himself and did a poor job repres the menu
3 plate left on the tabl too long
4 steak was bland and had no flavor  i ask for a1  

do not believ the hype  this restaur did not live up to the review  i rather eat a slim jim than pay for a tasteless 70 steaki guess im simpli get tire of the hype steakhous  vega hotel over price let put a top shelf name on the door charg exuber price then deliv about 25 of what it is worth  one of the most disappoint meal in a veri long time 

9 of us for dinner this even for my birthday and we are seat nice in the extern wine room with a larg tabl  aseth pleas our sommelli give us some reccomend from this 500 plus wine list that is so complet and utter over price i cant even begin to believ they have the ball to charg some of these number   ok high rent palazzo hotel you go with the flow  a nice pinot noir and super tuscan are select as we await our waiter shep  

some friend bread with chees is present along with some veri nice hot bread with a varieti of butter  bread has a rosemari type garlic top veri good  unfortun this is where the major of the meal goe down hill  

multipl appet order shirmp ala diablo 1900 1 giant shrimp with a piec of italian bread in a spici marinara sauc  specia beef cheek ravioli with a cream sauc top with a drizzl of balsalm vinegar was differ  an angoltti was then present with cream  mushroom  other end of tabl had veri nice big eye sushi tuna cut veri thin told fresh  hous salad were ampl not lack in flavor 

entre 3 veal chop 2 cook perfect 1 so fatti it was sent back and taken off the bill 8500 each for a veal chop good but certain not 8500 worth and that ala cart   how can you serv a fatti 8500 chop though   rib eye steak again massiv overpr ok but noth special  two veal dish with musroom were ice cold and had to be sent back came back hot next time but so quick cant imagin they werent just nuke  pasta with assort shellfish was fresh if not bland and a bone in fitlet migon was probabl best thing on tabl  a non bone in filet and 4000 lobster tail again cold you realli have to be kid here 

side dish were in short asid from the garlic mash potato a complet and utter disappointi from the fri eggplant to spinach with hot pepper bad

nic zeppol and whip cream for the birthday boy for desert   servic was on but they simpli coulndt handl how busi they were  

goe to show you put brand on anyth and you can sell ice to eskimo  2k with tax and tip when all was said and done it i have to be honest this was truli an untter and complet disappoint  probabl worth 2 star but with these price point a veal chop go back two veal dish ice cold a lobster tail and filet cold for all the zagat rate all the clip and my fellow yelpster i do not understand all the high rank this is a do not wast your money place that will never see us againthis place is a joke  if i were michael mina i would pack my bag and go home quiet  then again hes the one laugh all the way to the bank while serv up french fri and corn dog  sacr bleu

thi place is great for assist the snottsdal crowd and other unsophist palat at overextend their revolv credit a bit further but if you want good food then go elsewher  more expens doesnt alway mean better qualiti  sometim it mean your just get screw without the benefit of astroglide

artifici eleg set with a provinci crowd and mayb fine for a half bottl of champagn but i say forget it altogeth  zinc bistro is more fun for peopl watch while sip your bottl of krug and chompin on yer mac n chees hoss  want a good meal  go to houstonahhh the infam heart attack grill 
listen i am all for food that is bad for you 
there is a place in this world for it and i will defend that place in the world as i would defend my own countri from invas 
howev when food is not good for you it better tast good 
this is the failur of the heart attack grill 

when a burger is 800060004000 or 2000 calori it better be in the top 10 of all time burger this is more like the bottom 10 
the burger here are soooooo greasi 
if i went back id ask them for some burger with my greas 
now let me say im not that guy who wipe off his greasi food with a napkin and then eat when i seek out greas bring it on but the burger is so thorough and complet greas insid and out that there is no burger tast pure disappoint 
the fri cook in pure lard were actual excel i almost gave this place 2 star for that but then i realiz this is actual whi i am give it 1 star 
i do like the coke bottl in mexico with actual sugar not corn syrup or whatev the hell we use here that was a plus 
i dont smoke so i did not partak of the unfilt lucki strike lung dart 
the wait staff wow they arent wear much we had a cute waitress who would sit on the counter and my sister realiz that more of her butt was in contact with the counter than not she was play the role well flirti dingi there were some other waitress that were probabl 20 year her elder i will not comment further for fear it may incrimin me 
the atmospherewhit and red like in n out or 5 guy burger wheelchair for peopl who eat tripl or quadrupl bypass what no lipitor i would bet money that the scari dude who sat next to us ogl the cute waitress for an hour was regist in the state as a sex offend or at least on some fbi watchlist 

i will leav you with the follow thought as you ponder my lack of recommend for the heart attack grill 
someon said this place make hooter look classi actual this place make the crazi hors too in las vega look classithe 575 pound spokesman for this abomin die in march at the age of 29

httptodaymsnbcmsncomid41899470nstodayfoodtheartattackgrillspokesmandifantast food but i wish i could give this locat zero star for my experi  

on father day two week ago my famili went to black bear diner to celebr my grandfath  there was a total of five adult and we end up spend about 50  the food was absolut worth the money  i got the griz and it arriv on two gigant plate fill to the brim  it tast great and was satisfi  we were also celebr a birthday in the group and the server brought out a free peach cobbler for her  

the place was busi and a littl messi insid but this is to be expect on a day like this  up until this point we were have a great time but go to the restroom chang everything

i had to take my veri elder grandfath to the men room where there was what appear to be a black bear diner worker wear one of their shirt exit a stall that was not proper flush  there was a second black bear diner worker enter the men room behind us  the two worker exchang fist bump and word befor the first worker who just left a use toilet exit the men room without wash his hand  i know he didnt wash his hand becaus sinc i was hold the door open for my grandfath my back was to the sink and watch him slip right out the door  

if i did not have to constant be at my grandfath side i would have follow the worker out of the men room and confront him  to add insult to injuri there is a sign next to the sink say employe must wash hand  after exit the men room and wash up we left immedi  my stomach was churn think that this guy might have handl food without have clean hand  as we left a worker at the front desk was notifi and she said she would take care of it  

i left an email that night with the main email address for black bear diner and the gilbert store  after one week i did not have ani respons so i went to facebook where they final respond  i end up speak to a veri nice ladi at the black bear diner headquart  howev sinc this locat is a franchis store it seem that headquart cannot do much  i told the ladi at their headquart to pass along my contact info to the gilbert store  it has been two week sinc the visit and have not heard anyth from the gilbert store  

the best food in the world can not make up for a worker not wash their hand after use the restroomokar you serious charg cover at the door so i pull up with my roommat at bm to just have a quick drink  see one of the manag friend then the guy at the door saysth line not that long you should stand in line  uhm my roommi work at yardhous if she had her uniform on then she would walk right in then everi week we send a photograph everi wednesday to take pictur for spyonvega which cost us money now all the owner of my compani are friend with the owner of bm even when i show them my busi card he was a douchebag well there lot of peopl in the industri that come here and we cant honor everyon wtf becaus of this i offici douchebag blue martini to bowel movementwow blue martini is serious a joke now their new manag is horribl 

friend and i went in yesterday use our ladi vip card drink ticket check in on facebook drink ticket use valet coupon drink ticket all which we had done befor without issu im there on a week basi well last night we were told that we were exploit them by use those ticket becaus each of us had 2 or 3 im sorri it your loyaltycomp program and were the one exploit it

but that not the worst of it we decid to move outsid on the patio after the manag told us this finish out drink and leav but the manag came back got right up to my friend face and yell at her he said we move tabl to tri to scam anoth server it was ridicul now their cocktail server are tweet us say there are two side to everi stori and that the manag yell at us had to be warrant becaus the manag is so easi to deal with are you kid me what happen to the custom is alway right especi when we were complet calm throughout this entir situat and did absolut noth wrong

i have been a loyal blue martini custom sinc it open but i will no longer patron them when they treat their loyal custom this way

a a friend just comment wow get threaten for take advantag of the deal they have put in place becaus that make perfect sensjame beard would have cut the corn

  okay so i know you must be wonder exact what that mean  we went to the restaur on a wed nightpick up a great rose from az stronghold at public market to avoid the corkag fee and was look forward to a new dine experi  

thing start out fabouslyth wait person was well inform and help with the menu  we decid to split three dishes

w order the scallop appetizerthey were perfect  done to perfect which is not easili done with scallop  we split them put one on each plate

next came the jerk chicken saladagaina wonder complement of spici chicken and mangosth perfect marriag of spice and sweet

w comment we had made the perfect choic of the rose from az stronghold and look forward to the next course

and so it camejerk prawn grill pineappl on slawwith a half an ear of cornahhhhhh there the rub  the plate would look love but becaus we were sharingi ask the wait personif the corn could be cut in halfdont get me wrong i realli like my dine companion but could not just bring myself to  nibbl on the same ear of corn  the wait person took the plate  back to the kitchenw were saliv becaus the prawn smell realli wonderful

then the plate came backand the ear of corn was still in tack
dur the cours of rest of the even we were given sever reason whi this simpl request could not be accomodated

ahhth chef is an artist and cut the corn would have upset the balanc of the design of the plate  we could not cut the ear ourselv becaus there were no sharp knive there are onli two chef and there isnt time to accomod special requests

okthi is a restaur with mayb 10 tablesbi the time we left there were onli 2 peopl left in the restaurantso special request cant be accomod  also we would have eaten the corn but instead it was wasted

i am self employ and my custom are everyth to my livlihood  if i can accomod i will even though it might not be exact what i want to dobecaus the more import thing is i want to establish long term relationship with  them and have them come back again and again and again

unfortunatelyi will not be go back to breadfruitth food was general goodbut i would rather spend my dine dollar in someplac the recogn that it is so easi to accomod simpl request and the benefit to do that is repeat customersit would have been so easi to have satisfi custom by simpli cut the ear of cornim a huge fan of jamaican food have a realli good friend from the island that spoil me with authent recip that have pass down through generat in his famili and travel all over the world my palett is intern known lol 

back to the stori needless to say my tast bud were go crazi with expect well dannng my girlfriend and i stood at the podium long enough to pull up yelp and read sever mix review sinc we had been notic yet no one was come over to greet us we start toward the empti bar with one guy seat and a total empti loung area when we notic the sign pleas wait for server to be sear includ the bar so we wait and wait and wait until someon anyon would make eye contact with us final a waitress approach us and ask if we have a reserv i snicker like realli my girlfriend said no we do not and she state it would be a wait haha okaaaay so we wait onli short though 

onc at the tabl we began brows the drink menu in search of the jamaican rum wraynephew which they did so cool now as for the menu we both notic the absenc of jerk wing hmm we thought mayb well ask our server the server approach our tabl with a mouth of the day special select and a great grasp of the menu veri impress so we order admir punch and some starter she had the roast plantain with chutney dip and i had the bake mango fish roll the plantain were soft not crisp and void of flavor as for my fish roll they were pretti good but the fish was over cook the drink were a bit weak until we ad shot of wraynephew 

so as we sat sip a man stop by our tabl and ask if we were enjoy our food we look at each other and she ask whi jerk wing werent serv on the starter menu the island becam veri defens explain his island eat the whole bird not just part of it my girlfriend rebut have spent a lot of time in jamaica feast on local island cuisin as well as fall in love with the jerk wing wellll this stuck a nerv and to be quit honest i dont think he was expect a real repli to his question just pretend to care 

needless to say in life you meet some peopl that tri so hard to upscal their imag that they lose the true essenc of their ident oh and he was rude becaus he kept want to rush off as if the place was pack lol 

warn  the onli peopl that would be impress by the food are those that have never truli experienc realjamaican cuisin and to think their philosophi our philosophi is that good food should be good to eat my point exactly
in case your wonder the one star was for have actual jamaican rumwe decid to hit up the wine down wednesday that was happenin at tast courtesi of kyot  here what went wrong

th event is from 68 so we arriv just a few minut 3 mayb after 6 so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin  we walk in and the hostess she look like shes possibl the manag or owner ask if we were there for the event and then point us toward the back room where the event was be held

w walk in and there were about 7 tabl and there were peopl at them all alreadi  talk about earli bird get the worm  we had to wait for about 34 minut for the waitress to finish with a tabl to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event  she said yes and that she would be right out to help us  in the meantim anoth woman and her friend also took up at a patio tabl nearby

20 minut later the hostessownermanag look woman came out and ask if we had been help yet  we said no and she left onli to return with a small happi hour flier menu which she just hand from a distanc and didnt even come over to our tabl  i know your wonder whi i would wait the 15 minut but i realli want to see just how bad the servic was go to be and frank i just want some good 2 wine

it been about 5 minut and the same woman come back with full detail menus and i ask if the happi hour flier was the deal for the event and she said yes and then ask if we were readi to order  um you just gave us the menus 10 second ago

bi now im readi to just order and enjoy the meal deal from the event  i look over the happi hour flier and i see some app deal  they said there was a specialti appet menu  not so much but whatev  i can deal with that  then i see the drink section  the claim for the event was 2 glass of wine  i was excit to tri some nice new wine on the cheap but again not so much  in realiti it was 4 glass of hous wine which onli consist of three differ wine that werent realli what i was look for  by now the other women that were outsid decid to leav have had enough of this shenanigan  we decid after 30 minut sinc we arriv to go next door to sprout get some app and have our own wine down wednesday at home

i bet there are plenti of peopl that will have good experi here and continu to visit happili but this one experi has caus me to write them off for good which i dont usual do after one instanc  i wish that i could actual review their wine and food but the servic was so poor and substandard that it not worth give them my money  i understand if the food isnt good at a restaur  some are just better or more talent than other  howev ani busi can and should have good custom servic  i think this is where the clich line of if i could give them less than 1 star i would come in

oh yeah and i slap down a youv been yelp card as i left

tak that tasthave arrang our larg group in advanc we were given 12 the space we need the restaur itself was uncomfort warm and the servic was aw  to put it nicely

aft not be allow to sit at one of the four open tabl sever of us sat at the bar next to other patron not with our group who were drink and eat when we mention to the bartend whose attent it took almost 15 minut to get that we would like to order he was clear put out at the prospect of have to deal with it

a few minut later when i ask for a glass of ice water the bartend said no not at the bar 

when our food came it was delici although one of the order was wrong

in general the entir staff at the restaur seem put upon by our group

it a shame realli becaus the food was delici pretti sure i wont be return to blue adob grillbut the food was excellent

too bad the servic was so poor  id call earlier in the week sunday and ask if the restaur could handl a group of approxim 30 peopl from 68 on the follow friday  i was assur they could and that i should verifi the reserv by wednesday  they also suggest we choos from a shorter menu to expedit everyth  fine  the other organ call to verifi and was assur we were welcom  

i arriv earli and found four round top set asid for us plus one end of  the bar  we shove the tabl closer togeth hope to get anoth one into that corner but no such luck  the singl waiter struggl to take drink order and then food order as half our group end up stand and shuffl around other patron attempt to get to the restroom  we did snag one more tabl but when we tri to get anoth one a woman who i assum was the manag ask those peopl to move  that tabl was reserv  though is was not use until much later as we tri to check out  a few of our group at the bar were at first told they couldnt order food and anoth couldnt get water  

we realiz they just couldnt hand us and tri to get our check  i had to pay my drink order and my food order separ  two peopl got their check and the rest of us end up stand in a line to pay our bill  nobodi help this one poor waiter at all

i realiz we have a larg group but we did call more than onc in advanc and were assur there wouldnt be a problem  when i mention to the manag that we were not pleas with the servic she inform me that it was our fault and that shed warn us they were overbook  gee i dont rememb ani convers that went that way

a far as i know none of us had ani complaint about the actual food though  i heard mani compliment and my meal was veri good  it just that we were made to feel unwelcom the servic was veri slow and the peopl at the bar seem to have quit an attitud when our peopl tri to order anyth but alcohol

dont say you can handl a larg group and then drop the ball befor we even get starthere the deal

i go to restaur for two thing  food and service

th food at blue adob grill would get five star it was that good as a former resid of albuquerqu see i even know how to spell it i know what authent new mexico style food look and tast like and this is the real deal i had the carn adovado stack enchilada and they were delightful

sad horrif servic can destroy a dine experi and the servic here easili qualifi as horrif i was with the prearrang larg group mention in a coupl of other review onc i was final abl to locat my own menu and onc the server reluct and rude agre to take our order the food came relat swift i was disappoint that the fri egg i order was left off but the server said hed be right back with it 

i never saw him again 

the closest i came to get the egg was on my check where the cost was ad in rather than wait for what would probabl be anoth half an hour to get the check correct i just chalk it up as a loss and move on 

if you want good food and lousi servic come here if you want both good new mexico style food and good servic tri los dos molino in mesa veri close by or carlsbad tavern in scottsdalim sorri i hate to do this but im 95sure djs gave me food poison last sat  the reason i know caus im the onli one who ate the squid everyth els throughout the day was share familystyl with my friend  i was sick sick sick you dont want details

also theyv rais their price a lot  i was brag to all my friend about how great djs was and how itd onli run us 56 per person almost everyon spent  10     plus they were out of our favorit orang soda  nobodi els realli complain but what a wreck of a group lunch outing  djs let me down in sever ways

wont see ya there anymortick tock tick tock this line is not move tick tock but ooooh i think im still drunk and i need this coffe tick tick tick i even have a starbuck redcard so i can donat a bit of the money from my hangov healant back to aid research and take advantag of some wifi this will be worth it i hope tick omg now i have to pee tick tock tick this is tortur tock

fin it my turn  but wait out of croissant and there no wifi serious you dont accept your own starbuck card well you didnt have to be rude about it time up this place is an absolut wastthis place blow  the onli reason i have gone is to meet friend  they happen to know the owner who is a woman who work there and eventu one of our friend start work there  i would never actual order sushi at a place like this if you do then it is just your fault for the result  it is not a restaur it is a bar folk  i have snag a piec of a roll or two off a friend plate and i can say that those littl roll at the groceri store are much better  i would realli like to emphas that if you are go to a bar for sushi you get what you deserve

i never order anyth fanci usual a beer or some gin but damn they are slow as hell get the order done  there have never been more than 10 peopl there even on a saturday at midnight yet they are so slow you would think they were swamp  hell for the group i was with be on speak term and offici regular you would think we could get some damn servic  guess not  

this place has been dead everi time i go  you would think the club next door with a line would give them some overflow  park is a disast becaus valet take everyth  in fact the last time i tri to valet they told me they were full but took the car behind me  appar my honda is not baller enough for them  i wound up find a free spot veri close anyway but that area is such a nightmar  i will never suggest anyon go to pearl becaus there realli isnt anyth posit about the experi  

bad servic bad food bad park scottsdal price  no buenoi use to be a fan of pearl until my birthday this year i call a week earli to set up a time that would work for the restaur sinc we had a larg parti and never got a call back not onc in an entir week in fact when i call for the 5th time to doublecheck that everyth was set up no one even knew what i was talk about even after i had call both the restaur twice and tammi who i can onli presum to by the owner twice in fact rather than admit they were the one that drop the ball when i call the restaurt the day of my bday and also the bday dinner i ask to speak direct to tammi after attempt to get ahold of her for a week and she start off by scream like an absolut lunat into the phone she call me a liar and said i had never call and complet cut me off when i attempt to say anyth to her talk about know how to run a businesswow

even still i understand she probabl had a lot  go on and we had a veri larg parti but that doesnt excus her lack of profession or the complet disregard for ani of my attempt to get ahold of her the least she could have done was call me back to tell me one way or the other if they could accommod us or not she was beyond disrespect to not just me but also my mother who attempt to calm her down after she laid into me she told her that becaus i didnt text her she had no idea about my dinner plan realli tammi after talk to your employe and give them specif detail in the begin of the week and then person leav voicemail with you twice befor call your restaur again and not onli that but text you that the most pathet asinin excus for first off tell me i never call and second for run a busi profession 

bottom line dont count on pearl for ani big event and dont expect tammi to go the extra mile or even be enough of a decent human be to admit fault and tri to fix the situat way to lose near 30 patron in one nighti am pretti sure the onli reason this place doesnt have a one star rate is becaus there are so mani scottsdal you know what that go here that they keep the rate up 
mi husband and i had the worst dine experi here i have ever had we were cram into a small tabl adjoin a larg parti after a 45 minut wait and watch countless other group sit down befor us if you want the real scottsdal scum experi it here a bunch of idiot walk in and basic claim to be some big shot in scottsdal aka 30k millionair and sat down befor us when we final got to our cramp booth the larg parti we sat by was so rude we could bare get through dinner the man sit at the tabl with a group of trashi girl was claim he was shoot heroin in the bathroom at pearl nice right he was sweat profus all over the place our food took way too long and let me just say you get what you pay for the bottl rocket were pretti good but there was noth special about anyth els on the menu after wait 40 min for our food our drink final arriv i would definit never come here again and would not suggest it to anyon unless you were the cast of jersey shorei will not choos to go back to this place i had a martini it was ok other peopl had the suishi again they said it was ok most the custom servic here is aw dont go in with a group they forc everyon at a tabl to be one 1 ticket they will not split a ticket will not i even talk to a manag and they refus to do this i felt like i was impos on them for bring them busi dont go here there are plenti of good suishi place around that will actual appreci you busi dont do itit doesnt help that the even end with me tell the managerown exact what was wrong with all the food that i had tri there and him walk back in shake his head in a surpris unprofession manner  he tri to tell me this food win award everi year somewher  i definit did not get anyth that would win award  oh and although i point out specif problem in techniqu he blew my issu off as be just a matter of tast  mind you i was the onli asian in that establish  kitchen and otherwise

korean taco  there is noth korean about these taco  we dont use shred meat for one it way too salti and all i tast that had a korean link was soy sauc mayb some brown sugar  ownermanag guy said of cours it korean it has korean spice in it  i dont think he know anyth about korean cuisine

california roll  how do you mess these up  i guess by not put anyth but crabmeat and a tini bit of cucumb that was poor matchstick  these were so bland i end up put some of the korean taco meat fill on top and ad some of the shell crumbl up for texture

eeldragon roll  the dragon roll had one thick slice of avocado across 3 piec of the roll  the eel was over done in sauc that tast almost burnt  it either not season right or over caramel  of cours this same sauc is found on the eel sushi

th peanut butter jellyfish roll  this was actual not too bad  noth to write home about but not complet wrong like everyth else

i put pretti much all the wasabi we receiv into about half the saucer of soy sauc and could bare tast it  is it fake  the roll were also slice uneven which is a fine detail that you appreci at good sushi restaur  they were also not roll tight enough so everyth fell apart pretti much as soon as you grab it

al in all never againi have not left a dine establish as upset as i was when i left pearl the experi i had as absolut horribl i am not one to make a big deal about noth and i more often than not give peopl the benefit of the doubt but i can honest say i was shock and extrem furious after my visit 

i bought a localdin certif to go to pearl and have been die to tri the place out they have a great menu and it is in a fun locat the term on the localdin clear state that it is onli valid monthur we went on tuesday at 7pm sat down  i pull out the coupon and was prompt told by the bartend we dont accept those on tuesday then he walk off let me also clarifi that while it was 7pm it was not crowd or busi there was no one els sit at the bar with us 

i wait for him to come back so i could show him that it clear say on there that it is valid onli monthur he then notifi me that it was in fact not valid on tue or thur becaus they have special i explain to him that we drove more than 30 minut to get there and we could order off the main menu and not get ani of the special if that would be okh said it was out of his hand and he couldnt do anyth and walk off a femal server chime in that there noth we can do to help you it just how it is then she also just walk away are you kid me not a singl person was will to talk to us and explain thing or give us 2 minut of their time 

the custom servic was absolut ridicul i have never been treat so rude in a situat that i clear had a right for clarif today 1052011 i see that localdin is featur pearl with the same coupon that clear state valid onli monthur

th server was horribl parti of 9 he refus to take our order on paper instead he made us rais our hand first with the steak who want medium who want mediumrar  then with the egg who want what it was even more frustrat sinc he couldnt rememb our order and had to ask again

dont ever come here for the steak and egg special read my previous reviewi tri not to review angri but i had someth happen to me at luke yesterday that has never happen to me befor let me begin by say that the food at luke is realli good i am a semiregular custom the combo sandwich is my favorit definit someth two peopl can share 
we went for lunch yesterday in a group of four peopl the other thing you have to know about luke is that it get busi and there is not a lot of tabl we happen to look at the time as we sat down and notic the time was 1201pm we ate our meal and just as the last person was finish the owner came and took our tray we thought that was nice he is clean up for us the he came back to the tabl and said if you guy are go to loiter and talk there is tabl outsid peopl are wait for your tabl at which point i look around and notic that everi bodi was seat at that moment i havent been accus of loiter sinc i was fifteen at the mall food court  we got up and left look at the time it was 1219pm we were there for 18 minut it not like we were go to stay much longer as we had to get back to work i will definit not be go back to luke again just base on the poor attitud the owner display yesterdayso ive gone here a few time in the past but after my last experiencenev again  what a jerk the owner is  sinc i would go in onc in a while for the haddock and chip i figur id get their restaurantscom coupon where it is 10 off  i go in with my girlfriend and show the coupon  immedi there is a problem  i have use restaurantcom coupon dozen of time and there has never been an issue

th manag talk to me and explain they dont allow the coupn on ani item on the special list and a bunch of other thing they wont accept it on limit my select to about three item  none of which i likew  it doesnt say anyth on the coupon about this and then the owner the british dude come over and angrili express that they never want to be on that site and they are not honor the coupon anymor  i made the point in a calm manner that ive been a loyal custom and he say he doesnt care and wont accept the coupon  whi not  it is out there  i purchas it  noth on there say it is limit to certain item  10 is 10  if he accept it i would have spent plenti of money on that visit plus futur visit  never again will i give them my money  i dont support jerk whose food is just averag at best anyway  might be the onli place to get haddock but it isnt worth it

psit isnt the onli place to get haddock in phoenix  wanna know where  messag me and ill tell youi stop by cafepino over the weekend for a famili lunch 2 adult 2 kid and had one of the worst restaur experi of my life short version incred overpr bad food incred rude and ineffici service

it start out well enough  i like the atmospher when we came in and we were seat quick we were given a lot of differ menus  appar both breakfast and lunchdinn item were avail and there were separ sheet with drink and desert the menu was incred disorgan and confus so it took us a while to decid on the order

eventu we decid on a coupl of entré item for the adult two kid meal a juic and a hot tea this is where the troubl start our food took a veri long time to arriv and while we were wait two of the restaur worker liter got into a shout match a few tabl away from us which end about 5 minut later with one of the two storm out of the restaur the other person follow short thereaft and their argument continu right outsid in plain sight of all custom sinc they were stand by the window right outsid the restaur this seri of exchang took some effort to explain to our young children while wait for the food

sinc the restaur was near empti my guess as to the long wait for food is that perhap one or both of the peopl argu and storm out of the restaur were suppos to be cook and serv order no one stop by to offer us some bread or small appet or at least to apolog about the long delay when the food did final arriv it was incred bland and uninspired

our kid were get veri restless by now so i ask for the check short after the food arriv i was assur that the check would be come short about 10 minut later our kid had enough wait so my wife took the kid and left the restaur while i stay behind to pay the bill i made sever more attempt to get the check and was final told that one of the peopl who storm out of the restaur in that shout match earlier was the cashier and they had call someon els to come in and take over and ask me to be patient

whil sit there wait to pay for this horror show i watch sever hapless waiter misdeliv meal and beverag bring wrong food to the wrong peopl and have food turn away at the tabl numer times

i spent about 30 minut in which no one ever stop by my tabl to offer me a complimentari beverag or dessert as a way to apolog for the long delay to add insult to injuri when this backup cashier did arriv he simpli drop the check on the tabl without so much as a glanc at me and ran off and lo and behold they simpli bill me for the full amount  get this 70 for two kid meal and two adult entré a juic and a hot tea

to recap  i sat through a shout match which near came to blow by restaur employe had to wait over half an hour for my check and did not get so much as an apolog for all that an absolut nightmar of a restaur i will never go there again and wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemidisgust is the onli word i can think of for this food  perfect squar orang color deep fri fish that make mcdonald fish filet seem like a gourmet meal  the onli thing resembl shrimp was the fact that they form the fri shrimp into the proper shape  after take one bite of fish and one of shrimp i thought at least i have the french fri to eat  they were nasti too  i wasnt expect anyth fanci by ani mean i came her becaus i want greasi fri fish and shrimp and the onli part of that i got was greas  i just dont understand the love for this placei just cant get as excit about cold stone as some of my friend  when it first came out everyon was all atwitt and so i felt i should be too  i mean it ice cream and you get to pick all the stuff you want in it  in essenc your make it so if it suck you have no one to blame but yourself  but i dont blame myself i blame sucki top  i know for a fact that vanilla ice cream with browni pecan caramel and fudg can be the most delici thing ever so when theyr put togeth here or at ani cold stone locat and they suck i dont blame the combo i blame the quality
also pleas help me understand this if you could on the menu it say signatur creation and list price for all size includ kid  yet when i tri to order a kid size i was told the smallest they could make it was like it  first of all no i dont like it second whi is it list on the menu if it imposs  am i too old to order the kid size  if so what the hell  i shouldv said thank but no thank but instead becaus i could smell the waffl cone while i was eat my good for me salad across the way at 1130 i forg ahead with the like it size took five bite and threw it away  that a dollar a bite for mediocr ice cream  and dont even get me start on the empti calori i blew through
nev again cold stonei went there this last monday for happi hour and dinner  
most of my experi was positiveuntil the end we did have a few small servic issu most of which are typic of a fair new staff in train  howev we did have a big problem regard our bill at the end

dur our meal on 8312009 dinner time the manag came by and ask how everyth was go we let him know that it was great but to pleas send by our waitress as we hadnt seen her in awhile
 
when we receiv our bill we were pleasant surpris to see a few item comp to a 0 dollar charg  i grab my card and gave it to the waitress to pay the tab of approxim 1450 i was quit surpris when she return the card and receipt which had now been charg to my card for more than 3600 without even mention it to us  she had also remov the origin receipt and put a new one for the correct amount

i ask to see the manag who came buy to discuss this with us  here is a quick breakdown of the conversation

quest from manag did we eat the items

answ from me of cours we didth issu wasnt that we were pay for them it is that your staff substitut the receipt for a differ one charg us more than doubl what i author and didnt notifi us  how can you do this without at least let us know that you chang the amount

answ from manag well i am hear a differ stori from hersh indic that she told you  plus we have alreadi given you a good break on the price of your drinks

respons from me first off  dont take it from meask the 3 other peopl at the tabl   second it was happi hourthes were your advertis price  how is it that you gave me a break on your prices

respons from the manag look what is it that you want from me  you ate the food it was a comput mistakecan i have your busi card

respons from me my busi card what doe my job have to do with this

answ from manag  it look like you just left from work in a restaur by the way you are dress  

at this pointi sign the receipt and left  zero tip of cours sorri to be an jerkbut i was not happy

to be honest i dont rememb ever be more frustrat with someon befor  i realli wasnt expect a free ride or meal but an apolog and explan of how you can replac the origin receipt with a new one for more than twice the origin amount and charg it would have sufficmy fianc suggest we go here and though i read all the lousi review about this place i figur meh ill give it a shot  well everi review you read about the lousi servic is true or the one realli lousi server get around  slow servic and she was absolut clueless now if she was busi id chalk it up to be slam but she wasnt  took forev to get drink take our order never brought napkin got the order wrong forgot my saladi could go on and on  realli horribl  

and the wing were ok but whoever said great wing was misguid or inexperienc the other food was pretti good but the servic just kill it overall

so next time your at cadillac ranch wait and wait and wait for someon to take your drink order look across the courtyard  see san felip  now there is a good place  take your appetit and your money leav cadillac ranch and go across the way to that restaur  youll thank me i promisso i wrote a review on this place a while back about how this place was unfriend to tattoo peopl and wouldnt even let me get close to the front door and was pleas to see that i got a littl apolog from the owner but when i read the actual comment she left it was this

next time actual read the review 
  thank youdont be fool by happi hour price i went yesterday and the waitress talk about 12 price appet drink well drink etc that price is onli good at the bar if you are at a tabl you will not get it i went with some friend and we order drink and appet an order of chicken wing an order of pretzel 2 doubl vodka  7up a singl vodka  7up and 4 coke  crown all order befor 7pm when happi hour is over total price  71 someon in manag must have ridden that bull and hit their head  and the waitress fals advertis until the bill come if you are out for a happi hour in temp drive on past this placefirst of all im out to have a good time on my birthday the id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was 11 pm on my actual birthday then we get in and the bartend male look over at the femal bartend and goe are you go to get them to which she rude repli no you get them 

everyon was rude from the get go we just went to check them out i give good review where ever i go but i felt bombard with rude and hate it we walk out in less than 5 minut dont do iti should have walk out right after i walk in  my gut was tell me to leav but i didnt i stuck it out  big mistake

w were the onli one in there at 1pm on a saturday bad sign 1  i order the 1lb of boil shrimp origin style with rice  i didnt realiz origin meant no flavor and way overcook  they were so overcook they were hard to peel and were serv with a chipotl mayonnais  gross  the rice was liter asian rice with a sprinkl of  cajun season on top that tast exact like a bowl  of white asian rice

mi partner had a jambalaya thing thicken with cornstarch and had overcook shrimp as well  

i would high recommend avoid this placeveri bad service
long wait rude waiter have to wave down waiter to get service
happi hour price are good roll are cheap but not worth the servic tradeoff
il never go back and neither will ani of my friends
i went there for the happi hour but left after i got piss after be treat like a door mat
found an even better place 2 mile west tokyo lobby
friend greet good servic better happi hour and 5 larg sake bomber all day long

k sushi on 43rd and oliv has the best roll ive had though nebraska roll it awesome
dont know their happi hour price but they have 2495 all you can eati got 6 order of rolls
they have 50 state roll one name after everi state plus all the tradit rolls

mi money work the same in everi restaur but yen will never get anoth dimei think peopl general go to a pizzeria and bar type place for three basic things

1 food
2 drinks
3 service

sinc i could get neither food nor drink i can onli speak to service

and i think i just did

i am not exagger here i was in la bocco for an hour befor a server approach while the pizza look fabul id heard peopl talk about get their 30 45 minut or more after they order so i opt for a beer

30 minut after that with onli one fleet glimps of the server i left

y it was crowd yes i was there for the ignit phoenix afterparti but it not like it was stand room onli and they had previous notic we were coming

walk out after an hour and a half to find your car tow clear not la bocca fault and not a factor in the one star review make for a pretti lousi experi 

too bad look like a cool place but serious it not that difficult to pour a beer

and dont park ever on the southeast corner of mill and 7th street

upd i just had to stop back by and give prop to the owner julian who contact me via yelp and apolog for my poor experi no excus no fluff that commend and the right way to do busi 

ill have to go back and take him up on that drink offerrude rude rude

i would give them less than one star but yelp wont let me click that

last night was my third visit to kampai and each time i went the love that i felt the first time has now rub me the wrong way im a chow hound and alway seek the best and i had found it here the sushi the way i like it 

ive bounc around to sever sushi bar throughout the citi im a onc or twice a week ahol it my ol standbi dinner and i was pleas to have found this place onli two block from where i live but for last night i stop in for some nigiri sushi togo and was told we are close as i look around the room which was fill with peopl i ask again and was rude and cold told we are close ok ill give them that they do close at 900 pm and there was fifteen minut befor that happen and they still have patron still have their dinner and a to go order should not be such a imposit on them with this economi nobodi should be turn away custom thirti buck is thirti buck they should be glad to have custom like me who do return and spend their hard earn money with them return loyal custom are what busi strive for or so i thought

i realiz it was a full moon last night it was beauti i know i actual took time to make a mental note of how love it was as my rumbl stomach scream feed methe end of an era
what onc was the best sushi restaur in phoenix is now under new manag and it definit shows
they have tri to bring in new roll similar to those at everi other sushi place they have chang the ingredi in mani of their roll includ the spici tuna roll and the shrimp tempura roll which were the one that kept us come back kampai was special becaus it wasnt like everi other scottsdal sushi place it had the freshest ingredi and the most authent roll not anymore

th qualiti of the ingredi is now veri poor compar to what it use to be the fish is slice much too thin the roll were not as fresh or as tasti even in the slightest their spici tuna roll which use to have fresh tuna and cucumb and sprout is now made with a mixtur of chop tuna and spice with krab mix 

they chang their entir staff which will come back to bite them sooner or later the new sushi chef was rude did not want to engag in convers and plain did not acknowledg us our order was taken much later than we were readi to give it and we had to ask for water then anoth chef came into the sushi bar area from the back wear a plain tshirt not a uniform and without wash his hand he began to make our food there were sever question instanc when cleanli did not seem to be a concern of the sushi chef 

sanit is major at a sushi restaur and so is the food so is the servic so is the music which they chang from nice tradit music to soft rock sinc all of these thing have chang my famili who has been longtim custom of kampai for the last 15 year will sad not be return kampai you just lost some previous dedic custom 

at least we went here in may for my birthday befor they chang i wish we knew it would be the last time that we could enjoy our favorit i dont see how they will stay open for much longerbase complet on the comment from this busi to my honest review i wont be come back the health depart is around for a reason and if this restaur reject their standard as too institution i cant imagin want to give this place anoth chanc as i state if the violat were silli one like not have their letter grade display in the exact place specifi by the health depart id overlook the grade unfortun this restaur appear to proud flout safe foodhandl procedur and theyr extraordinarili sanctimoni about it listen yayo taco im not in cahoot with the man i just dont like food poisonmy visit to this place was not onli disappoint but it made me sad to think that this place would probabl go the way of planet hollywood in a year or two i had the carnita and i had to cut or should i say saw into it with a knife and fork my friend crab enchilada were underwhelm i was heartbroken that yet anoth famous latino is slap his name on a brand that will probabl fail instead of actual check out the food and make sure it edibl veri beauti decor and nice but not terribl sharp staff is about the onli thing i can say about this oneim a sushi purist  pleas no fusion crap  veri few place can pull off fusion and im sorri but your definit not in the run serv me my fish off straight from the water onto my rice  thank you sir now get outta my way your block my view of the fish im go to devour

hug disappoint pricey trendi and most empti and how dare you forget my soy sauc again  dont you serv sushi doesnt it say that in the name of your restaur even after i point it out to one of the server he joke said yah and were a sushi joint you think wed have soy sauce

gimm my freakin soy sauchell to the noooooo  this place doe not even deserv my rate but i must warn the yahoo out there that think it might be okay sinc it is in the palazzo  

group of sixal sushi enthusiast from californiareadi to throw down a great meal after a great show btw blue man group rock 

the worst servic evah whi have three differ kitchen if your server cannot keep up with one  order sparkl saki moon rabbitgot star rabbit insteadmmmmokbut to have the nerv to treat me as if i didnt know which saki i order shame  

then we look at the menu
seri 6 for one piec of sushi wow  i know i can get grade a sushi without the price elsewher so i opt for a quasim and order the lobster for 25know it was gonna be small i figur i would tri and get somewhat of a meal sinc my sushi bill alon wouldv been off the chart  i was told it was the shell with three small piec of lobster on top  wrong i about fell over and die when i realiz after dig through the smelt egg with my chopstick that there was no meat  no lobster meat whatsoev  i went in again and pick up what i thought was meat and it was a piec of shell  holi shitthey just serv me lobster tail without meatno lie

i sent it back and refus to order anyth els sinc the rest of my parti was almost done with their meal  i was annoy hungri and our check took a fuck centuri becaus our server knew she was get her 20 no matter how shitti our experi  

bewar this place is a sham and a sorri excus for servic peopl that are will and readi to spend good money for a good meal  i hate the strip for that veri reasonim back bitch  

unfortun the review that i chose my return on isnt a glow five star but a glower 1 star

th onli meal i ate in vega for 3 day  i kid you not was friday not at this place  it came high recommend by numer friend so i thought this should be some great sushi  

boy was i mistaken 

first we had a 10pm reserv  we arriv at 945 think well grab a seat at the bar and sip on a cocktail and peopl watch at all the bachelorett parti etc  well 45 min later and we still didnt have a tabl  my stomach was growl and my face was scowl at this point  

the hostess was rude when we would ask how much longer for a tabl she would just say your next  realli im next you said that 10 peopl ago

when we final got our seat we order the following

rock shrimp  it was tempura batter  the first few bite were good but as everyth began to cool it just becam mushi  

fusion sushi roll was bore bland and well you get the point

th onli thing that was excel was the sea bass it was moist delic and absolut delici  but 25 for 2 skewer left me want  

the peruvian corn was awful

th restaur itself is everyth that you would expect from vega upscal trendi and expens  200 for three item and 4 cocktail  not worth my onli eat experi in vega that weekendwe stop by the circus circus buffet for lunch after take a break from adventuredom and i have to say that this might be the worst buffet ive been to it a toss up between here and the buffet at south point circus circus might win out for the worst buffet becaus their employe werent veri friend and did a terribl job of clean plate off tables

first of all let me address the food ive been spoil by go to the buffet at bellagio wynn and m resort where the select are endless and qualiti is top notch but here dio mio it abysm they have four differ station breakfast lunch salad dessert

breakfast
 waffl soggy
 pancak dri and hard
 bacon burnt 
 chees blintz ok
 sausag you can get better qualiti in the frozen food section of ani groceri store

lunch
 mash potato good
 taquito dri hard to swallow
 fri shrimp decent
 pizza remind me of cafeteria food at my high school
 chicken finger limp the bread was a littl soggy
 penn pasta average
 green bean and mix veggi average
 they also had burger and fri chicken which i didnt try

salad bar
 pasta salad decent

desserts
 cooki the best this buffet has to offer
 browni dri and crumbly
 carrot cake dri and crumbly
 raspberri cheesecak mushi but decent

ther just wasnt much to choos from in this buffet and the stuff they did have was poor qualiti we tri most of what they had but noth was abov averag when your best item are mash potato and cooki you know your in troubl the servic was just plain bad we had a pile of dish sit on the edg of our tabl that wasnt pick up until we were readi to leav thank god we got free pass to this place becaus i would be piss if i actual had to spend money to eat herei absolut never give a bad review the onli time i give a review is if i like it but i had to for this one becaus of the owner andi who was a pompous jerk we tri to be friend and he was arrog about his cook skill he went on that he use to have a cook show etc when ask if he did the cook he went on about he teach the peopl that work for him to cook it was like it was beneath him to cook no wonder his littl show never made it big  
i give this place 1 star becaus of the ambianc and becaus of the fabul gelato and fabul cappuccino and the owner wonder daughter 
we went there becaus of the groupon coupon we bought they were overwhelm to the point of be rude especi the owner andi it seem like they need to staff accord they were upset becaus peopl did not make reserv and just show up while we were there  quit a few peopl walk out it not that they were pack either 
1st of all we tri call sever time and the phone was busi continu youd think at this day and age they would have voic mail or someth 2nd you make reserv for place that are a full servic restaur not a cafeteria style servic this is a place that you look into the cooler and decid what you want that is alreadi cook the food was terribl now if you do not cook it may be good for you both my husband and i are veri creativ cook the lamb was the worst i have ever had dri and absolut no flavor yes and i know my lamb my husband had the dri turkey our son had the dri meat loaf i think all of them were dri becaus they were reheat in a microwav we do not do that even at home the side dish were still bearabl    
i would have gone back there for the gelato and cappuccino if we did not have other place i can get the 2my sister and i found this restaur through groupon our first impress was good ador ambianc delici look case of gelato larg invit patio  we were greet by a sloppi sur man who we later found out is the owner andi 
we were seat on the patio along with the onli other custom  we start off by order a bottl of spark water you guy dont want ani wine said andi abrupt uh no thank  next we order dinner  my sister is vegetarian so we were order meatless option this even  we order a select of bland bore typic food for some reason andi seem confus that we want to share a few item  the food came andi drop it and ran off  we were share so we want plate we wait for a long time no andi  i went into the restaur to ask for plate and some saltpepp andi seem confus whi do you need plate i dont get it you eatin it like chines food or someth he brought the plate and the salt  pepper and said you know you realli shouldnt put anyth on it until you tast it thank for the word of wisdom  
we ate our depress display of  cuisin in hope that dessert would help this disast we wait and wait and wait and wait some more andi was busi sit at the other custom tabl talk all night  by the time he final got around to clear our plate we were so readi to get the heck outta there we decid to skip dessert 

next came the ice on the poor made cake
i decid to tell andi how i felt about the poor servic  as a person in the custom servic industri i know i would appreci the polit construct critic  he was appar outrag by the comment he proceed to argu with us about everi comment we had  he even went so far as to walk into the restaur to yell to his cowork about my appar salaci comment  he told me the balanc of our groupon tab was on him i left cash on the tabl for it anyway  he then chase us into the park lot to tri and give the money back  when i refus he yell i dont want this i will donat it to chariti 

whatyike read other review i realiz my bad experi wasnt uniqu as a server i make a veri laid back custom i like pretti much everyth i eat and dont requir a lot of attent from the waiter 

la piccola cucina would benefit from just one extra person in the front of the hous our guy though ador and friend was too busi to refil our drink and to rememb to bring our appet though charg us for it the ahi tuna high recommend over the other fish option he said was so overcook it was the color and consist of chicken like other review mention he was frantic and made that clear to everi custom at one point i even saw him in the kitchen cook  they need anoth person 

i left super stress out from the experi which is veri veri unusu for me you can either have bad servic or bad food but not boththat this place has more than one star on averag lead me to believ that there are mani mani mani peopl in phoenix who were born without tastebud 

let start with the posit la piccola is cute and clean both of those are import so well done that earn you the one star that yelp say i have to give you in order to leav a review becaus trust littl piccola if i could have given you negat star i would 

mi busi partner and i came after work today to have a littl strategi meet and take advantag of the live social deal she purchas worth 30 she was told when she call that she had to make reserv and that the live social coupon couldnt be use for the happi hour price on appet okay fair enough we head on over after make our reservation

reserv are you serious piccola we were save the staff the onli one there dure happi hour this should have been our first clue the veri snarki server greet us with oh are you the one that call with the coupon awesom noth like make us feel like loser becaus we had the nerv to purchas a deal that you offer

slimi 

and decor festoon with a giant long black hair this was as the waiter told us the best hummus in phoenix if anyth here is the best in phoenix then i am the queen of england and i can guarante you no one is call me your majestii just had a terribl experi at la piccola cucina

 been to this restaur sever time in the past and enjoy the homestyl cook  needless to say i was veri excit when a voic daili deal came out that allow me to purchas a 30 food voucher for 15

this place is on my way home from work so i save the coupon for a night that i was work late  excit to grab some delici takeout on the way home

on of the server was in the middl of take my order when the owner of the restaur saw that i had the coupon  he snatch it angrili out of my hand shout this is onli good for 2 peopl dine in  not take out  i inform him that this restrict was not state anywher on the coupon that i had purchas and he shout back i dont care  that the way it alway been  in a restaur full of other diner the shout continu until i was embarrass enough to leave

i just cant believ how complet rude and belliger he was to me  in my opinion this is no way to ever treat your valu customers

i will be demand a refund on my coupon and wont be return to this restaur againokay here what happenedi walk into the restaur around 3pm and the veri friend hostess see that it just two of us ask if we want to just sit at the bar my friend doe all the talk and soon we are sit at the bar this is when my first experi went to the crapper 

the bar tender was the worst server ive had in a while when we first sat down she was so pushi about the drink menu kept point ask what we would like to order  when we final just ask for water she basic ignor us the rest of the time except to drop off our menus for our food we didnt get our water until mayb 10 minut after sit there and we never got a refil in fact after she took our order  with the most disgust look id ever seen  she didnt stop by after that to check up or to see if the food was good when we were final serv our sushi she didnt bring it to us we were miss a whole order but she never stop long enough for us to explain to her 

what i dont understand is how she stay so busi becaus let me tell you there was no one at the bar we final had to flag her down for our check and even ask to get more water after we got our check i realiz that we were sit at the bar and so im sure she was bum that our tab wasnt go to be as high sinc we onli order water but you get paid on servic and i am still mad that she was tip at all she was a nasti doofi with a muffin top and saggi boob and if she ever want to make enough off tip to buy support bras shes gonna need to attend a few more custom servic orient class 

food wise i was not impress with this place at all is the seawe suppos to be slimi i will definit give sushi anoth tri but i wouldnt go herei use to like blue wasabi

admit i like other sushi place better  blue wasabi was more of a drink place with decent sushi and i dont mean decent like not indecenti mean decent like eh it was decent

thi place has the acoust of a mess hall  annoy but what realli annoy me was this

on time i was there with wife and inlaw and becaus i have a ridicul sensit palat at least when it come to salt i notic right away that there was some foul shit happen with the soy sauc  by foul shit i mean that they were serv the low sodium version  paus for ensu outrage

now they serv their soy sauc in littl innocu look devic that dont come with the courtesi of a green or red lid  what this mean is that innoc peopl were unwit eat low sodium soy sauc  which is punish by law or divin retribut when kingdom final come  anyway

so i ask for the manag and say is this low sodium soy sauc and he say yes  and i say can i pleas have some real soy sauc and he say we dont serv anyth but low sodium soy sauce

on fuck star and be glad you got even that  you should be embarrasswow  im surpris by the eager 4 and 5 star review of this place  flat out this place scare and horrifi me  for mani reason  most becaus when ani number of my inlaw pick a place to go it either this place or serrano see my other review friend game of russian roulett anyone

th other main reason i hate this place is the fact that i have to shower when i get home  the whole famili congreg in the laundri room and we all strip  we leav everyth pile in the stench of burnt food and smoke wood and we take shower to get rid of it  there is noth wors than your pillow the morn after san tan flat if you fail to take a shower when you got home

i dont understand the whole stand in line to order thing  is it a sitdown restaur  yes  if you eat insid and can actual get a tabl  is it a fastcasu like pei wei  kinda  you stand in line but no one bring you your food  so realli it fast food  you place your order and go get it when your number is call  yeah  but it a steak and it is anyth but fast  

speed alon or lack thereof is reason enough to stay away  i dont wait for food  i dont care how good it is a wait this long is unaccept  oh but it not even good i forgot to mention  actual my husband and my food came out quick 20 minut  and we order steak  everyon els in the extend famili order burger  over an hour and fifteen minut wait  for a burger  did i mention the food not that good  and half the menu is veri overpr  they should stick to the cheap stuff it is all anyon order anyway as evidenc by the run on burger that caus oppress delays

then there is the salad bar   im surpris it pass health code  see those tong that are lay on top of the lettuc  you do realiz that everyon els in the place has had their greasi littl paw on that handl that is in direct contact with the pile of lettuc  icki poo

and then there are the fire pit  has osha been here  good god this is such an accid wait to happen  it is so friggin dark out there there are all these rage fire pit kid run everywher all these odd obstruct that are ambianc  barrel wheelbarrow just wait to be trip over  did i mention a young woman was taken from this place some say kidnap is a better word and kill  that not on the advertis is it

th onli posit thing i can say about this place is that they give you a monstrous amount of pizza imagin a larg pizza box precis fill with a giant squar brick of a pizza easili an inch and a half tall and cut into squar slice that what we got id say it was over 3 pound of pizza flavorless and gross i found it breathtak that it had that littl tast this was a suprem pizza that tast through and through like i was eat playdoh oliv sauc chees crust the work to top it off the mushroom were slimi can champignon and not fresh at all and tast as though theyd just been pull out of someon nose ive had some pretti bad pizza in my time most of them id liken to eat chewi dri cardboard this was the first one that was this big and relat succul and still tast gross

i stomach mayb six slice over two sorryass sit befor throw about 23 of the pizza away two pound worth of food down the sh1tter i dont know where the mass delus about this place come from but ill never return if i want a gutbust special especi now that bronco billi is gone ill head to ray just down the road instead plus lucki is overpr a larg and a smaller pizza cost us 30 most of the smaller pizza was thrown away too  i didnt tri ani of that one so im not review it but the wife said she was incred unimpress with it and it was just a plain chees if it all tast good it would have been worth it  id have paid that and more for a chuck wagon special from billi  but the lack of flavour and valu drop my rate of this joint to a bottomofthebarrel singl star and just for proverbi and giggl httpwwwmaricopagovenvsvcenvwebapptabsresultsaspxnavigatedfrominspectionresultsdrilldownaapermitfd05766businessluckys20pizzaaddress1550820w20bell20rd20suite20207inspid3182324ugh after an afternoon spent at home depot pick out door and faucet for our first hous my love and i had work up an appetit  we knew we want a patio probabl a brew some lunch and a comfi tabl to discuss the hand of paint swatch we had in tow  so temp was the answer until on our way there we notic this retro look hamburg joint with a miller highlif banner hang in the window  we decid to skip the drive and go for it there was even a patio

i have a mini meltdown when the waitress come out of the kitchen to serv someon their pho who has just walk in like 10 min ago

at the point the waiter open the kitchen door and said it readi  if it fuck readi give it to me  i was about to freak out but there were some young buff vietnames guy there and i didnt know if i start troubl if i would just have to fight the waitstaff and kitchen help at pholici or if the vietnames clientel would join in and fight me as a gang

th dude refus my money back and hand me the bag of food that had probabl been just sit there the whole time  what a bunch of fucktard these peopl at pholici are  with the kitchen storag area in the dine room and your 2 gallon of shampoo from walmart

i get the food home and i have a hungri wife and daughter  the crab and asparagus soup sound great and had gotten great review  what the fuck yelper  this was noth more than can egg drop soup with white asparagus chunk and dice fake crab meat  dice fuck dice  that some old school fals advertis there  fake crab suck balls

i also had the slice pork and vermicelli with chop egg roll  the egg roll had decent tast but didnt tast fresh  evertyht els was dri dri bland fuckitti band

thank for the overal shitti experi pholicithis was the first and last time i will visit this sunni establish pleas let me start by say dont be fool by the name think you may get some spice in your meal when visit this establish i would like to enlighten ani potenti consum on the epic failur of the even i just experienc failur number one they had our reserv incorrect and multipl time mention that we had made the reserv incorrect failur number two your menu onlin doe not match your actual menu when you say you have hatch green chili on the menu make sure you can actual serv it multipl time i ask about the spice and was told it was veri spici and was disappoint at the lack there of i am a lover of new mexico green chili so if you compar your food to it you shouldnt be light year off on the descriptions

third failur of the night was dump a full ice cold drink down the side of my leg and back of my pant not onli was i upset at the fact you soak my jean but then offend at the idea the server was go to get a blow dryer and dri off my pant if i want to wear my jean straight out of the wash machin i would have done so but thank you to the servic staff they took liberti of do that for me so you want me to take off my pant to blow dri them you say failur number four 

epic failur number five was the subpar meal that follow along with the flame drink that is not worth order the food was by far the worst thing of the night which compar to everyth els would seem like noth if you think you are go to get food turn around and go back home and eat a bean burrito  

after all that we attempt to salvag the even with some humor but then come failur number six when the bill arriv we were told that although the server dump a drink all over me noth could be done to adjust the bill it was just a littl liquid as i was remind by the server and the manag i wasnt look to make a scene but when i stood up from the tabl someon ask me if i had an accid im 29 and housebroken even to this point i was just annoy 

this bring us to failur number 7 when pay for the bill we present our over intellig server a 50 visa card and ask her to run the card for that amount and came back let us know it was declin in surpris i look up the account inform on my phone to onli see of the 50 load on the card the previous day a 48 charg was in the transact histori for fire and spice when we ask the server she respond by ask if we had ever stay in a hotel befor and how there is an incident charg which is whi the card didnt go through i ask for the manag at this point who felt it was okay to tell me again that the bill was now be discount becaus of the small spill on me so after show him the charg onlin he then got his second level manag 

oh boy if you are in the mood for be told you are an idiot this is the guy to talk to failur number 8 when you walk into a custom servic situat as the second level manag in an issu normal one would look to diffus the situat and not escal it not this guy he enjoy full confront with custom not to mention he also wit the event of the night unfold and rather than offer to make the situat better he chose the much higher rout of say that clear our card was declin becaus there wasnt enough money on it even after see the transact histori of the card with their establish as the onli charg noth he said made sens and walk away as if we bother him by ask for an explan of the charg 

so here to you manag of fire and spice at the sheraton hotel in temp az keep it classi and bring in custom to make them feel warm a fuzzi insid bewar hospit is at it finest in this establish  winmy husband and i ate here last night for the first time and we will never go back  we didnt know that it is realli onli a place for drink not eating

th chip were greasi and all broken in small piec  the salsa was not anyth i would want to eat again  my husband order the tortilla soup and he said it was ok  i order the fish taco and took one bite  it didnt tast right  my husband tri one bite and had to spit it in to his napkin  they were bad  spoil or someth  my side of sour cream was warmish not cold  my husband tri his chili cornbread and it was burn greasi and not cook through in the middl  i had order a side of guacamol and it was over salti and did not tast fresh or right either  

i notic that there was a prep area near the edg of the restaur where waitress cut avocado and scoop them out  bottl of their salsa were left out and not return to the tub of ice where i assum they were suppos to go  it did not look clean or well maintain  vile

w told the waitress that the fish taco were bad and they did take it off our bill but to be honest they could have taken everyth off the bill  noth was worth pay for  no wait my husband had a margarita and he said it was pretti good  so that it  i guess the salti senorita is a loud  annoy place to have a good margarita and a decent bowl of tortilla soupwent here 0812013 place was shut down by the counti and the notic said immin hazard

it appear they had refriger issu but still chose to stay open think about that sushi with out proper refriger vomit never again if you come here after know this you deserv a stomach virus  they obvious dont carebewar of the fraudul practic of this business


i am absolut furious 
after receiv terribl servic on a friday night nonetheless which includ my server not bring item that i order when the conveyor belt was empti my friend and i both decid not to tip him becaus of his terribl servic and attitud in respons to our requests
today my friend check her onlin statement for her credit card and found that she had been overcharg 2 i go onlin to check my statement to find that i had also been overcharg 2 check with the 3 other friend who ate with us and decid to tip the server we were the onli 2 who were charg an extra 2 on top of our bill furious i call teharu was told that the manag was unavail and proceed to begin explain my situat and was ask if i left a tip i explain that i hadnt becaus i had receiv terribl servic in my opinion by not leav a tip i am help my server to realiz that he did a terribl job and he will therefor reevalu his servic and perhap improv upon it be that mani peopl comment on their subpar servic that they receiv here the server must not be tip veri well is this the way that teharu respond by overcharg custom illeg when i sign a merchant receipt i am agre to pay the amount that i writenot ani more than that it no wonder that their servic doe not improveteharu is illeg make custom tip their server i bet we are not the onli one that this has happen to which caus the server in turn to have no incent to improv their custom service
what upset me even more was that the woman on the phone said that there is no proof that i had been overcharg unless i bring in my receipt and bank statement in which case they would refund 2 to my account obvious it onli 2 so im not go to go all the way there just to get it backil probabl spend more on gas do that what infuri me howev is that when i explain that what teharu did was illeg and fraudul the woman on the phone was absolut unfaz and did not seem to care about her busi immor practic furthermor my friend is a veri light eater and 2 was near 333 of her bill imagin that  terribl servic and a 333 tip this busi is absolut terriblei refus to support a busi that cheat custom out of their money by mean of illeg and fraudul practices


upd my friend spoke to the manag who was appar on break when i call earlier and he said that he saw his worker on the phone with me and consid interven but didnt the manag continu to claim that this was a mistak and that it happen often my friend said that he seem concern and want to help us by offer to refund us 2 howev we do not care about the money but rather that this doe not affect other peopl therefor our concern is not about the fact that we were both overcharg but rather that this busi is not take the necessari action to ensur that their custom are satisfi and treat with honesti and respect be that the manag recogn that this is a problem that aris often i do not understand whi they are not take this issu more serious and investig the sourc of this problemif it happen so often how is it an accid we express that we do not think that this is an accid in ani way and that we will be contact the polic to investig teharus fraudul busi activ furthermor i have alreadi submit a complaint to the better busi bureau

if you have eaten at teharu and paid via credit card i high suggest that you check your bank statement to see if you were overcharg if you were overcharg i hope that you will either comment on this post submit a complaint to the bbb or call the polic direct as i will be contact them short i do not feel that anyon should sit by and allow a busi to conduct themselv in this manner  it is not onli wrong but illeg and i am determin to put an end to teharus fraudul practicthis place could have been amaz ill never know

mi husband who is vegetarianvegan and i be vietnames thought this would be a great place to tri dure our visit to phx this past weekend 

the troubl start when the owner a white man ask me whi i didnt have a vietnames nose i was taken aback and did not know how to respond i said what do you mean he repli you know wider and flatter you know my wife is chines and rais in vietnam i was flabbergast i mean i know he wasnt intend to be hurt or borderlin racist or whatnot but it realli bother me that he felt he could say this to a complet stranger let alon a patron in his restaur and that he felt justifi simpli becaus his wife is asian all i could muster up was uhhh youll find that peopl can look a varieti of way  

i dont know even though he apolog my husband and i were left with a veri bad tast in our mouth and we end up leav befor we could order 

the owner was just weird unprofession and inappropri it doesnt matter if the food is good we werent even abl to get to that point  it all turn out great though becaus we end up go to green see my review that was close by and it end up be even bettersubway is a royal piec of shit 

they pretent to be healthi but they use tran fat in all of their food 

butter and natur veget oil is metaboliz 

i cant believ they wont do the right thing and take it out of thier food 

it is ban in mani countri and in multipl state here 

f you subwaywell this place doe have an appeal new space in a great locat but yuck we were so excit to have a new place in central phoenix howev maizi was disappoint to say the least 

the place was absolut pack good for them we just couldnt figur out whi parch and hungri we were eager for our new dine outing we were lucki to get the last tabl but then there we sat unacknowledg for over 15 minutes

fin a cute pigtail server ask if we want someth to drink on the chalk board at the barther were featur wine special my date ask the price point of the sauvignon blanc the server repli i dont know do you want it we said it depend on the price she walk off irrit that she had to go ask for us she brought back the wine with a stand that didnt even fit on our tabl and plop it down and walk away the wine was a good choic and reason price 

a woman who seam like manag whoosh pass and notic us struggl with the wine rack and replac it with a small chiller

littl miss pigtail return and took our order our salad return in a speedi manner as we lean in to each other to have a convers over the roar of the crowd we got a kick out of watch a tall male server continu smack into a poor place low hang lamp ouch 

salad were serv in bowl that again were big for our tabl and made the portion appear skimpi in the larg vessel even though the portion size was good the flavor on my salad were well balanc and even tasti howev the green on my salmon salad were so over dress they were drown the salmon spice rub was wonder but the fish was dri and veri overcook my date mediterranean salad was the exact opposit no dress at all no flavor at all the server suggest a dress and my companion agre but it just wasnt there it was full of well intend fresh ingredi but  they were just sit in the bowl naked

i think that the area can realli use this  swanki new spot but the food qualiti present and servic is in serious need of attent i have found better at the food courti have now been here 3 time and my first time was great as i state in my first review  but my last 2 visit have not been a pleasant experi  i went for brunch a few month ago with a group of ladi 25 of us and our servic was pretti terribl  first we had confirm the number of peopl in our parti the day befor but they still seem unprepar for such a larg parti  our server was pretti rude as well i swear she never crack a smile  our parti arriv within 30 minut of or reserv time some right on time other a littl late and we had the larg center tabl and 2 booth  our server state after onli 15 minut and 12 of us be there that she couldnt hold the tabl if we all werent come  we assur her we were and everyon did show up  it was the continu littl thing not refil water not bring fresh chill orang juic when we order anoth bottl of champagn for mimosa  roll her eye and sigh when we ask for the check to be split and never say thank you befor we left
last night was so bad i wont be back  i met with a friend for their pizza and wine special which i was super excit for  the biggest problem was the bartend she was rude inattent and total cut corner when it came to make us happi  we order a pizza and one of our top was goat chees but onli on one half  when our pizza arriv it had mozzarella on one half and goat chees on the other when the mozzarella should have been on the whole pizza  this is a total honest mistak and i can see where the confus could have been in what we said and what she translat it to mean but instead of apolog she was a bit argument over what she thought we said when we order  to make matter wors instead of have a new pizza made she ask the kitchen to just add the mozzarella on the side that was miss it and refir it  what  it was char in some place dri out and all togeth simpli not veri good  we were starv and contempl send it back but twice in one night just seem too much  
there was a nice gentleman that work there who ask how are pizza was bartend chick never did we actual had to get her attent the first time to send it back  we were in the middl of explain whi we didnt realli like it when ms snarki say if you want me to have a new one made for you you should have just ask  wtf  i have work in restaur and usual when someon send someth back you remak it  you should have done that in the first place  she was so rude and it was realli hard to even be polit to her at this point but i remain in the act like a ladi zone  the did take it off our bill and gave us a free dessert  let me be clear it was the gentleman who gave us the free dessert he was veri charm and apologet  if ms snarki was nice about everyth i wouldnt be write off maizi forev but the ice on the cake was when she sat at the bar one seat down from us to eat her dinner  i think that is veri unprofession but that wasnt what bother me most  the ladi that took her place behind the bar and ms snarki had a 10 minut bitch fest complain about custom and how they can be such a pain in the ass  the proceed to regal each other with stori of how custom have annoy them  we paid our bill and left  ms snarki didnt say one word to us on our departur  there are so mani great place in the same area with a much nicer staff  those are the place i will be spend my money ati want so desper to like maizi the food is good the atmospher is decent and it on my street just a 5 minut walk from my front door unfortun after two terribl and embarrass experi i have decid to boycott them for life

fin i went to plan b and call golden coral they were more than happi to make space for our group and even gave us our own dine area and server i give a big thumb down to cracker barrel this type of custoom servic is total unaccept it would have been just as easi to say they didnt want our busi to begin with they not onli disapoint a custom they disapoint 42 in one shot lack of custom servic onli end up with lack of customive alway love the kabuki in temp i went here for the first time last night for a friend birthday the place is clean nice and classy

 howev while me and my friend were eat edamam half way through i found a maggot stick out of my edamam i show it to one of the waitress who just kind of smile and didnt even apolog the manag came out and explain how they use organ edamam and that sometim thing like this happen he offer us a complementari dessert which we turn down sinc we brought a cake for our friend bday he then offer to give me not everybodi els a discount which i said yes to when we all got our order none of us could  eat my spici tuna roll tast like it came from a local groceri store i was sure it wasnt just the maggot incid 

the manag came back and gave me my sushi for free my sushi was onli 550 he act like he was do me a favor our server didnt check on us or apolog for the maggot she didnt realli care for our tabl sinc she was go to get an automat 18  gratuity

update
despit tri to contact the owner sever time i was consist ignor until i wrote a letter to the nevada public health servic who prompt did launch an investig the respons well it was a short email that didnt even admit guilt for our ill  

ye there are sever veri posit review for this place but if you get sick here dont expect an ounc of sympathi from the owner  just be prepar to crap you brain out and deal with it yourselfill start off with the old say you never get a second chanc to make a first impress pleas read on

i dove and hour to get here i was so excit to find anoth tart yogurt shop
decor is minim but tend to follow the same theme as far as these type of place go

i order a small tart with strawberri and kiwi see pics
 it had a nice creami textur but not quit tart enough  i though the first coupl of bite were tarti but then it just die off 

low and behold tell tale sign of cheapskatey and rob the custom was the hollow center of my yogurt see pic i realli hate that and this is the biggest hole so far

mi daughter got a small tart no top or so she thought mid way through eat she uncov a pickl hair pube short and cur whatev you want to call it what a monument vomit factor came into play here did this have anyth to do with the creami 

ugh 
he apolog and refund our money and assur us it was too short to be his hair 
but when you think about how doe a pube accident make it way into a frozen yogurt batch a bug mayb  but a pube no way

i dont think ill be drive outta my way to go here againi can back up kendra statement about the menus as well we had to wait ten minut for a menu becaus there were non avail30 second in this posh place and i was alreadi excit they had a coffe bar the most awesom assort of bottl beverag ive seen in ani hookah bar and the atmosphereoh my is it lavish

it was a trap

 15 for a one hose hookah tie the priciest ive ever paid wait what that it 20 just becaus it a saturday night now your push it well at least i can split the cost with my friend four peopl to a hookah will be alright i suppos a cover charg you say five dollar for each of my friend who didnt order a hookah alright now were up to 35 for four of us to share a one hose

but the nickelanddim doesnt end there youll also be requir to purchas a drink no hard feel about the drink itselfth introduct to sparkl voss 4 was welcom but to pay for that after the coverisnt that a littl extrem for a hookah bar

aft shell out what felt like a ripoff i was still readi to have my mind blown by this place too bad i didnt even get to sit on the second floor i ask and receiv no reason whi it couldnt be done when my parti was the onli one in the build if you ever have the misfortun of come here youll see whi that a big dealth second floor is the coolest littl balconi youll ever see at at a hookah bar

so i final get the hookah it look like an expens piec but i was displeas to see instant light coal low qualiti sit on top i huf and i puf but could bare muster one iota of smoke after suck ash i complain to the waitress who was almost clueless about what to do

15 minut later i got my hookah back it smoke alrighttoo bad they use the cheapest shisha whi charg so much when you use such a low qualiti product 

i can bare even call harem a hookah bar i think that just a front it a place to sip coffe and voss in style that just happen to serv subpar hookah on the side it the most expens place of it kind yet has the worst qualiti i have ever encount one star is too much and i may never go againunless they let me smoke on the second floorokay so i am a total hypocrit by give this place one star consid the fact that i have been here more than once
anyway for the peopl who have never been here

loc next to ra which is pretti busi like all day surpris this place is never busybut i person love empti hookah loung the loung is veri attract this place appear to be veri upscal there is a full bar and the menus light up which is pretti neat there is also an upstair and outsid seat area

th major downfal about this place are that there is usual just one person work it the same guy that been in there everytim i went he is veri inconsist on check on you to see if you need more coal or not he actual isnt even in the front half of the time everytim i got a hookah it has alway been harsh everytime

also the price are go fck yourself ridicul extrem high for what you get the shisha isnt a veri good qualiti in general and to have the audac to charg 3000 for a singl one hose this is unaccept under all circumst ya your a nice look loung butif you give me halfass hookah how am i suppos to enjoy myself whi did i come here again sinc i had such a bad experiencewel it convient to me and im too lazi to travel

if you are a regular hookah smoker or just in the mood to smoke your better off travel the extra 10 minut to tempafter the truth on the calori count of the cooki have come out i have to updat my review which i first did in octob of 08  wow i had been get dupe for a long time  this was my go to spot for lunch with friend after a saturday gym session and i would often stop by for what i thought were low calori dessert dure the week  but i cannot support a busi that has been lie to their custom sinc as far back as 2010  i know onli the cooki have been analyz but that is enough for me to doubt everyth els on the menu and how it is prepar  thank you todd wilbur and jane ann morrison for reveal the truth about rvchttpwwwreviewjournalcomcolumnsblogsjaneannmorrisoncookiesmightbetoogoodbetru 

i final have answer to my question i email rvc sever week ago ask for clarif of the peanut butter cooki calori count it rais a red flag to me becaus it didnt seem possibl for a peanut butter cooki to onli have 27 calori when the label on my jar of peanut butter read 118 calori per 2 tbsp yes im awar of other altern but at the end of the day calori still dont add up the 3rd parti test seem to back this and be pretti factual

mayb were not all savvi baker but someth just wasnt quit right here im not someon who count calori or eat by a point system but i do like to know what im eat like other have said if calori are be hidden what els is in the food that shouldnt be 

httpwwwreviewjournalcomcolumnsblogsjaneannmorrisoncookiesmightbetoogoodbetrulost all credibility

w alway knew the calori count at rvc were too good to be trueand it turn out we were right 

the las vega review journal recent test the chocol chip cooki and found each one had on averag about 157 calori  near 6 time what was advertised

th food was ok servic left someth to be desir but outright lie about calori is deceit and unethical

unfortun i wont be revisit rvc in the futurthe bbq is veri good but the servic is horribl they wont tend to you if your not korean i thought it was a figur of my imagin when it happen the first 2 time i went but nope the third and last time i ate there was for my dad birthday we walk in and was wait 10 min becaus the restaur look busi anoth group walk in after that who were korean and the server final look over and i told her parti of 4 she ignor me and take the group of 8 behind me i look at her in disbelief confront her that we were wait first she final seat us next to the door then they made us wait 20 minut befor give us a menu and ask what we would like to drink i will never go back jin mee restaur is way betteri left cold hungri and penniless

mi friend and i were in the mood for ayc koren bbq and this place was on my must tri list  upon walk through the door we were prompt greet seat toward the front of the restaur receiv a pitcher of water and a coupl menus  within minut we order the pork belli spici pork belli kalbi and the boneless sirloin i forget what it call all off the ayc menu

th waitress came back with our four differ banchan the sirloin and put kim chee sprout and pork belli on the grill  from there it all went downhillslowli  

we devour the pork belli but the ladi had turn the fire off so we kind of just sat there wonder what we should do  meanwhil everi time peopl came through the front door it wouldnt close  which meant the frigid night air was blow right on us and other tabl seat near the front  without complain we kept stand up to close it  youd think that after about 20 time of do this along with the other tabl near us some employe would have seen us and offer to fix it  but youd be wrong  

final a nice waitress the onli nice one came by and we immedi bombard her with request if she could somehow fix the door pleas start the fire again could we get more food water and banchan and we ask for steam rice  it took about 15 minut befor anyon came within earshot of our tabl  whi on earth would it take 15 minut to get water refil let alon more food  this is a restaur right  they serv food here right  regardless we were final abl to defrost and we final had some food and water  woo hoo  

warn buzz kill come  about halfway through the sirloin we start wonder when the rest of our food was come  and we kept wonder until one of my friend stood up walk to the counter and ask for food kalbi spici pork belli and more rice  short thereaft the spici pork arrivedbut no rice  

not so short thereaft my friend had to stand up again and ask for the kalbi  this time we tri to be smart about it and order three order  nope they said  we could onli have one order per tabl  um hello the menu doe say one order but it one per person  regardless we were hungri and tire of wait so we took what we could getbut no rice

aft finish the one order of kalbi we still want more  howev have sat there for more than 2 hour and have onli four small order deliv we were fed up of not be fed  we were tire frustrat cold they turn off the heat again and the server were avoid eye contact with us  in fact they didnt even drop the bill  we had to walk up to the counter and ask for our bill  talk about insult to injuri  have been near the door we could have just walk out without pay and no one would have notic us gone    

howev be peopl of principl we paid our 60 dollar for the food  then we leftto go eat somewher els  despit have ayc we were still hungriwe were so excit to come here becaus the one in la is realli good and had pretti good review on here but we were sore disappoint in the custom servic and ayc polici  the food tast okay for the most part though 

it is locat in a plaza in chinatown not on the lv strip  

we got here about 8 pm and there was no wait  when we got to our tabl we notic this huge dome grill it look like a lid or an overturn wok  it was cool  

we end up with ayc for our group of 6 at 1999 each  when we proceed to order our favorit we were told we can onli order 2 item at a time  we are use to limit item but usual 45 which was fine  after we cook the first batch they told us we had to finish everyth befor they would take our order for the next round  our grill was sit there empti while we were starv  wait for our food to be brought out by the wait staff  other tabl had full grill most of the time while we sat there with noth on our  

we order differ item on the menu including

beef tongu  good thin slice meat

spici octopus  quarter size when cook was okay

kalbi short rib  marin fatti meat not great 

side  not so fresh marin cucumb had a weird flavor

dip sauc  did not look appet either

spici bulgogi brisket  kinda weird look  this did not look like our usual bulgogi so we ask about it  

us  what is that as we point to it cook on the grill
wait  it spici bulgogi
us  it doesnt look like bulgogi
wait  it brisket with other meat all clump together
us  huh
wait  it has other meat and brisket mix together
us  we still had quot bubbl with question mark  i just look like pork didnt we order brisket

w would have tri other meat but we were onli allow to eat so much due to be micromanag by the waiterwaitress not give us our food

aft we got on our car and start pull away the 2 server ran up to our car say they charg the wrong amount  even though they charg the wrong amount we total it correct and made sure to tip  i ask did you even look at what we gave total  he didnt and said oh you paid the correct amount and tip too  it made is feel like we were tri to not pay then complain we onli gave 20 tip

i will give 3 star for the flavor of the meat  side but need to take 2 star off for service

i would suggest to order from the menu a la cart instead of ayc youll probabl be more satisfi  we probabl would have been charg half the price consid how much we ate actual it was more like how much they want to give us

if you want to be micromanag when eat have someon tell you how much to eat at an ayc place and get a smirk for onli give 20 tip then come here  otherwis there are so mani other buffet in vega that are so much more worth it  the ayc korean bbqs in los angel are so much better foodwis and servic wise  the waitstaff need to go to custom servic 101 classes

not  this is my 1st less than 3 star review out of 80 that ive written  definit not worth it for the servic as other have said  disappoint  asian buffet scare me i usual dont know what half the stuff is and if i do know what it is it a microwav crazi sauc version of what im use to grant i came here with a hungri hoard of ucsd dragon boater so we were all starv from a long day of paddl yes i ate but i was terrifi that everyon would be sit on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be total unabl to paddl our race the next day

microwav edamam was my friend sinc i saw the costco size bag sit on the side i figur id be safe with these and i attempt to tri everyth els like the random seafood mushi sushi and fatti meat their dessert were weird generic cake that seem to be salvag from the sale section of the local groceri bakeri so i stuck with the frozen yogurt

lot of better option out there but i guess sinc there were about 50 of us we were limitok  see below referenc wet behind the ear server i pop in here today for a quick sandwich  it was late 120  so i figur it would be an easi place to grab a quick bite  

sinc i was alon i head into the bar  barstool  but wetear asian kid spiki hair glass direct me into the dine room where there was onli 1 tabl of 2 occupi  ugh theyr do work in the bar  sit here there more ac it was goosebump cold and complet unnecessari   when i ask him where the ladi room was he repli beavisi  uhhhuhh theyr do work in the men room so youll have to hold your nose if you want to go to the bathroom   

sinc we both knew that i need to go to the restroom i order quick  slider combo and an arnold palmer   uhhuh our uh lemonad thing isnt work so we dont have ani    i order water  

then five minut later he sheepish return  hold glass  uhhuh i ask the bartend if he could make lemonad so if you dont like it no problem  lemon water sugar  yeah tough  not even a full glass then add ice tea  hard  real hard

15 minut after thataft watch him chat away with hostessmanagerwhatev  he come skulk back to the tabl um i have a confess we dont have ani brisket   

it been 20 minut  and hes just now tell me no brisket  are you kid me   

so i ask him as i survey the entir empti dine room  if he thought that his servic the poor communic with the kitchen the lameass excus had anyth to do with the state of their busi   uhuh mayb it just me   ya think   

do you think that folk who come in here for lunch have time for this foolish  get your act togeth  and quick  

then i do what i havent done in age  i left  i ask him what i owe him for the bad arnold palmer he correct answer that it on the hous  and i stood up and left  

couldnt believ it  

they have bloodi no busi and they think this bozo is help them keep custom

mi shop list consist of 5 pkgs of colleg rule notebook paper  10 3x5 notepad  they were complet out of the notebook paper  rather than say 5 to 8 of each notebook cover color about 25 to 40 total as is usual stock at ani walmart they had a total of three notebook in the store for me to buy

ov at the exit to the main door that i came in custom were gather tri to pri the door open but we were lock in  i went  complain  was told to exit at the main door all the way at the other end of the build  i came in the door that were now lock  what if there had been a fire or other emergency

that how it is at this walmart  they realli need to get rid of the manag here  get someon who know what theyr doi still cant believ it binkley restaur same ownership same town is one of my favorit restaur in the countri serious  ive been there dozen of time and recommend it to peopl constantly

i heard that cafe bink was a casual establish in town and that they had the amaz truffl ketchup  fri that id experienc as a part of binkley tast menu and they did and that was the onli thing on the menu that was decent 

actual quot from my friend is this suppos to be cold in the middle

servic was horrif at one point they liter forgot about us server didnt know anyth about the ingredi 

it is is possibl two have two restaur own by the same chef in the same town be liter polar oppositthis 99 ranch sucks

i first discov the 99 ranch chain in 1995 when i live in southern california  99 ranch becam my place for all my asian groceri need and when they start show up in northern california i was a fan of their up there too  

move to las vega i assum 99 ranch would be my place to shop  well this locat is a dump  it super pack in here and not necessarili with peopl but with box and can in the aisl  

custom servic is practic nonexist at this locat  when i need assist they were less than help  one night they were holler at us to go to the regist and pay for our groceri as they were close  i look at my phone and it was onli 845 pm  the manag practic block us off and said we had to pay for our stuff now becaus they were close  they also cover up all the veget befor close so you couldnt even look at their produc  when we went to the meat depart the guy work back there was too lazi to cut a piec of meat for us  he said we had to buy it as is  we think it becaus he didnt want to rewash his knife and stuff again  i ask him to weigh some ground pork first so i could determin if i want more and he said what he hand in his hand was half a pound  it was actual less and i would have bought more if he wasnt rush us out  and also im not so sure it even look clean back there  i was worri that i would get sick from the meat i bought here 

as a result i refus to shop here  ill pick sf supermarket or diho supermarket ani day over this dump  99 ranch chain should be embarrass by this locat  it reflect the 99 ranch name bad and the onli reason they remain in busi is becaus of their reput and their locatcame here with my grandmoth for a late night snack we order the spinach dip which came to us in a hot littl bowl but realiz the dip was cold the waitress was kind enough to send it back to heat up what we got back i assum was our same dip put into a differ bowl sinc it was a smaller amount

i took a bite and it tast bitter and bare warm in all honesti the dip was terribl it tast like horseradish was put into it and mix around i stop eat but my grandmoth ate more

w finish and paid and went up to our room in the elev my grandmoth said her stomach didnt feel well onc we got into our room she end up vomit for sever munut my stomach felt weird as well but i have a strong stomach 

whatev you do do not order the spinach dipmy first one star

i didnt think that was in me

on vacat cruis off the strip the neon light of the dunkin donut sign shine and beckon me

so excit sinc i love hit up this place for donut and their signatur coffeef sound but fit whenev i visit the east coast i love the mini donutsdo they still sell that and how they mix the cream and sugar in your coffe so perfect  am so excit a locat final open west coastish

but  i was so bummed
whi 
i tri to order  one vanilla glaze one chocol and one bavarian creme donut to my dismay the worker repli back that they onli had one flavor avail boston cream pie yes one flavor out of twelv disappoint but not deter i order three of them and an ice coffee

how did it taste
donut  stale not even from the morn stale but the morn befor morn yesterday stale 
ice coffe  good as i remember

would i go back
coffe yes
for donut not this locat i might have to hit up krispi kreme or winchel sinc donut and coffe are an ultim tast combinjoel robuchon is the chef of the centuri  this place has three michelin star 45 star on yelp and recommend by foodi  so natur after dine at a hand of michelin restaur we had high expect for joel robuchon  for chris sake rod stewart was sit at the tabl behind us  furthermor joel robuchon was in vega that night and see him ad a littl extra touch  

after do extens research my boyfriend and i opt for the two cours  here our story

th pros
 bread cart was amazing
 dessert cart was awesome
 amusebouch was yummi caviar
 the limo ride was veri much appreciated

th cons
th food  asid from the abov everyth was disappoint  

 le canard duck was pass at best  the foie gras on the side was overcook we love foie gras but had to forc it downfoi gras should not be that way
 the king crab wasnt even memor  i was disappoint after a tast  it wasnt bad just noth special
 la châtaign soup was veri bacon in flavor  i can honest compar it to bacon cook on a stove top and thrown into cream sauc  the foie gras in the soup was overcook as well  i wouldnt even know it was foie gras unless i read the menu 
 le veau veal was pass  it wasnt someth i tast and felt wow i must have this again  

after we finish our experi we felt disappoint with the food and mention that it is not worth three michelin star  in addit i start to feel queasi  i thought it was the food rich howev if onli that were it  i spent the whole night amidst a toilet throw up   i had one glass of wine so it was not alcohol relat  drunked and heart burn over food poison ani day  fail

in my honest opinion joel robuchon in vega is live off of it hype  it either polit that gave him the star or what it use to be  but the qualiti is subpar so save your money do not dine here  

so overall
joel robuchon food  bad
food poison  veri veri veri badworst dine experi in 2009 for me  where do i start

1  sat at a tabl that had menus and silverwar but was obvious not wipe down
2  they cant decid who our server is 5 min 6 min 7 min go by and right at about 10 min someon is our server
3  menu say sam adam on draft  turn out after a long wait there is no sam adam on tap and we order again
4  potato chip were delay becaus they did not have ani premad chip  they arriv with the main meal
5  kitchen staff was joke around girl scream almost as if it was a littl spring break parti insid and everyon could hear them
6  calzon was ice cold in the middl  frozen ricotta cheese
7  pizza was burnt on the top  no your not suppos to have those black circular splotch on the cheese
8  just a few casual apolog from the teenag waiter for the abov  no manag apolog no comp item nothing

thi place seem like it was transplant from some dopey colleg campus where everi custom is 21 or under and just come here to get drunk regardless of food qualiti servic and the time it take to get food

nat new yorker is a failur  i regret not take the other yelp review more serious sinc nni has a clear trend toward the low end of thing at this locat and on bellsorri to anyon who like this place but the keg is a big fat disappoint  just like the parti with the same name alway were back in colleg to be fair we onli went for happi hour but the specialti drink we tri and the appet we order were both realli gross in my opinion a restaur need to make a good impress at the bar becaus a lot of peopl myself includ tri place out by order a drink and appet or two given how bad what we tri was what incent do we have for return for a bigger meal 

from the outsid the keg look like your runofthemil steakhous onc we got insid howev we were shock at how sleek and upscal the decor was the bathroom in particular were gorgeous and superclean when we went to sit at the bar we were expect some realli classic cocktail and satisfi appet the happi hour drink special was an orang martini so i thought id tri it my husband got a heineken 12 off dure happi hour which cant be mess up 

to eat we order the slider which were 995 they didnt have ani happi hour food special the martini was realli sweet and tast like it didnt have a drop of alcohol in it it kind of remind me of sunnyd which i hate grow up and now wouldnt serv to children if you paid me the slider were even wors they were suppos to be primerib slider but i would have rather had ground chuck the meat was chewi and fatti and remind us of the sausag in an egg mcmuffin which i like but wasnt expect on a slider there were also no top like onion or tomato  just a sauc or piec of chees on each one instead of fri on the side there were just measli littl fri onion blech we could have gone to rubi tuesday right next door and gotten better slider 

in the end we didnt spend more than 22 or so but be a happi hour fanat i know that there are plenti of other place latitud 30 is a notabl exampl where we could go and spend the same amount and get some great appet and drink we definit wont be backcame here for mother day per friend recommend my mom and i both order the delmonico steak my steak came out fine but my mom steak was too salti we sent it back and the 2nd steak came out with no flavor servic was veri poor and the restaur wasnt even busi we had to ask the waitress to refil our bread and she forgot twice manag knew the problem and didnt even stop to talk to us worst part is the manag walk away to avoid us as we tri to approach him for the price we paid for the food we expect better servic will not go backwelli was taken here last night for my birthday dinner at the suggest of a friend  we were go to dine at the keg becaus my request was filet mignon and king crab leg  this placeoy  we had a 715 reserv  had to wait for a few minut to be seatednot a big deal  we were sat and began to look at the menu  pricey  which is fine for us usual  ask our waitress brittani if they had filet and crablegsi was told that i had to order two plateson for steak and then anoth whole plate of crab legshuh  12oz filet was 34 and 16oz crab leg plate was 46andal of the entre come with no side at allyou have to order your side seperatelyanoth 814 just for a side what  no salad beforeno noth  they brought bread out to the tablebut they were breadstick and they dont even give you enough for everyon at your tabl to have a whole one to themselv put in our orderfood arrived40 minut later  are you kid me  yesther was a well done steak in the mixbut that should have taken 20 minut  at the most  our foodserv brittani was extrem scarc  extremel  the steakwhen it final came outwa veri good and freshi will say thatbut the fri we order for my soncam out cold  sent them backstil room temperatur  and they tast like they were fri in old greas eh  it was birthday and i didnt want to make the tabl of my guest feel uncomfort by complain  so i zip it then  i was told they would be bring out a special dessert with a candl for my birthday  okaycool  brought out this big plate with a delici dessert on it and a roman candl to blow out  i think it was the butter cakewhich was absolut delici  

finallyaft flag down the too busi to give us the great servic we thought we were pay for brittanyw got the bill  we had 6 ppl in our parti  two of the peopl split a steakmi husband son and i split two filetson 8 oz and one 12oz and a 16oz king crab legw had the french fri trio to splitlyonnais potatoesand the lampchop fondu our bill came to over 250  how  they charg us twice for the french fri that we sent backth share of the over price mealsandth birthday dessert  they charg me for the birhtday dessert that they chose for me  had i known that i would have like to tri someth els on their dessert menu  they charg me for a dessert i didnt even get to pick out  i am in total disbelief of this place  dont go there  we are by no mean cheap peopl  but like anyon elsedont like to go somewher that we feel we were rob and cheat out of a great dine experi do not eat here  you are better off pay the same amount of moneyget great serviceand not feel like your rob and ani other reput steak hous this place need to do some serious think about their price and teach their foodserv that if you are go to work at a place that is that priceyth servic better be tip topdisclaim this review might offend you if you arent greek and take joke too seriously
 
they should call this place the bad greek actual mayb the name is a warn if you arriv here a happi greek onc you tri our terribl food you will leav a mad greek  i dont know who is back there make the food but the cook should be sent to live with the turk in cyprus for be so impress bad at be greek mayb this place was open by a turkish housewif as a passiveaggress jab at the greek i could sit and do noth but specul all day as to how these peopl got so truli terribl at life but then i would get hungri eventu which might caus me to need to eat more of their crappi food

kid asid we greek are a veri hungri peopl  if you are lure starv greek to your establish the most import thing you should know is that eat is not a joke to us  so dont burn the freak spanakopita  especi if you didnt even bother to put more than a half teaspoon of fill in it especi if one of the minuscul four burnt spinach pie nibblet doesnt even have the correct fill in it  did someon drop some jam in there  whi was it sweet  and whi did the nibblet consist of almost noth but burnt phyllo dough  this i do not like this is mere a remind of what could have been

everyth els was mediocr at best
premad cheap italian dress on my anatolia salad that you cant call a salata unless you want to confus them
dolmad pile sloppili under a sea of bland mysteri sauc loos roll as though they were taco bell burrito fill with unvari smoosh and what appear to be instant rice
precrumbl feta wtf  are they realli so lazi that they cring at the prospect of clasp their hand a few time to break up some block of feta

non of this should matter to ani greek read this becaus they had the audac to serv me bad burnt spanakopita with no fill  it was like a pastri version of the worst frozen potstick youv ever eaten  how dare they

what they have creat in the charliefoxtrot clusterfffff that is the mad greek is wors than spit on my food they have spit on my soul  dont mess with hungri greek  not cool  everi time someon goe here to eat someon yiayia drop dead so save a yiayia and dont ever eat herewent back again sinc the last time i was there the steak was so good we were seat as we walk in the door ask if we had been there befor and sinc this was the newest of sever visit i thought i knew what i was expect that is until we order drink 

we both order a beer and were prompt ask for our id now i have no hair on my head not by choic and look a ton older than 21 im 34 i didnt have my id with me the waitress said let me go check with my manag after a minut or so the manag come over and inform us she cannot serv me alcohol becaus i have no id i told her about the money she would be lose tonit sinc i am obvious older than 21 at which point she said this is the sound of my heart break in the most youv mistaken me for someon who care attitud  what the sound actual was was the sound of money leav her restaur and never return had she simpli explain whi they couldnt no problem no need to be condescend about it due to her attitud we left and found someplac els to eat and will never be back to the texa roadhousthere not mani place to go out to eat in the far northwest valley  my wife and i have stop in three time hope for a mediocr meal and passabl servic just so we dont have to drive 25 mile to find a dinner when we dont feel like cooking

lakesid is just plain bad  they serv a varieti of food and are good at prepar none of them  sandwich are on crunchi burnt stale bread with too littl poor qualiti meat  italian dish have soggi pasta with flavorless sauc ive tast better from a jar  which is obvious where they get theirs

each time weve been in to tri out their not fresh bland food the restaur was about 13rd full and it took near two hour from be seat immedi to get a check  we order 1 drink each 1 main and no appet or dessert  i think they have the world slowest microwav becaus that where the food tast like it came from whi the waityou know sometim you just forget where you bought that pair of slack that fit so good  and sometim you forget what an aw experi you had at a restaur last time

that usso fourth time is a never ever again  never

friday nightfish and chip  we love fish and chips

nev ever againmy famili and i have been here a few time i have never had a good experi but for some reason we continu to spend our dinner at lakesid i guess you call it applebe syndrom you know it is nasti but you keep come back 

after last night howev i will never be back we went for wacki wednesday which promot 5 special the price are 6 the portion are so pathet that i am sure this littl promo work out in the restaur favor less food for more money

w also order the chip and salsa which provid us with a mental stimul famili discuss do you tast mold or disinfect we never came to a conclus becaus we had our waitress take it away as quick as possibl they were unabl to bring us more becaus the entir batch tast like that homemad salsa my ass

so lakesid you can keep your fals promot horribl portion and disgust salsa

good thing the servic isnt too horribl or youd realli be in troublyes it in a casino and yes it ridicul overpr but even if they had normal chinatown price i wouldnt bother come back here with strip chines joint your pay primarili for the locat but it usual also about the food qualiti present and servic unfortun that not the case at zine  here all your pay for is location

 been here a hand of time most just for the noodl soup which were ok today was my first time have their entre and i wasnt impress with anyth we had it was probabl the worst bbq duck and pork ive ever had  tasteless grist just yuck 

as other have mention serv size is smaller than most place  mayb 34 of the portion you would normal get factor that in if your do famili style and just fyi this is what you get for 600 at zine seriously

12 veggi spring roll 4x beef chow fun 4x fri rice 4x bbq combo 3x steam veg 2x kung pao chicken 3x lemon chicken 3x honey walnut shrimp bbq combo is 30 for aw bbq  14 duck 14 chicken and mayb 14lb bbq pork 25 for an order of lemon chicken which is liter 1 piec of chicken katsu w some lemon sauc 

even if you gambl here and can get a comp  take your casino cash and get your money worth somewher els at palazzo there are so mani other worthwhil overpr place to choos fromi went to this place on saturday night and the two ghetto hostess  liter had their head down on the front desk i had to ask them if they were open and they respond rude then stare at me as if they didnt know what i want i final request that i have a seat and i sat wait for sever minut when i saw the waiter who look like he was either high or veri tire and not interest in work there after i saw the first 3 employe i decid that i was go to leav i will never ever ever go to that applebe  it seem like the place didnt have a manag on duti avoid this placecomplet total utter  unimpress 

i am not go to bother to nitpick my lame experi through 5 cours yes 1 of them on a tini spoon  mayb we took thumbelina tabl  

salad ok
steak chewi spat out sever piec  gross i know
with hash brown for dinner

sourdough bread serv with oliv oil  combin tast  acidic
smurf blue cotton candi  wth

1 star for a yummi dessert  but by then i was piss off so it onli count to actual write and insert this reveiw

end up a pissi nite with us blame each other whos stupid idea it was to choic to wast our nite and moola  herei had heard veri good thing about noca and was sad let down  the food was ok but veri overpr  the mussel were tasti everyth els was sub par  

the kicker for the night is we had a question for the manag about our bill and appar it was a bad day for him and we were practic escort out of the restaur  i dine out sever time a week and have never been treat so bad  needless to say i will not be head back to noca nor recommend to ani friend of mine  

what a shame  i love tri new food in phoenix and love the atmospher but a bad attitud from manag and overpr food will keep me from come back christoph guid to etiquett  comport 

alway greet your guest by cooli ask if perhap they have a gift certif never share pleasantri or offer the night special this help guest feel unwelcom and unsur of what the chef is serv like they will then be eager to prove that they are worthi to breath your rarefi air and full of wonder and excit at the mysteri that await them

when the restaur is empti leav your guest to sit all night in quiet contempl and prayer it is more import to feed their soul than their bellies

lobst pot pie should be serv lukewarm and with a steak knife if guest are stout enough to carv the lobster they are most certain hooligan firm direct them to the nearest ethnic restaurant

adject are vulgar scallop are therefor potenti the most nobl of dish in textur temperatur fresh tast and present scallop should be purifi of ani describ featur 

guest will show their appreci for your culinari artistri by send all the food back untouch you wouldnt eat a monet would you under no circumst should you suggest a differ dish nor should you offer to comp their bill 

it is polit to promis to bring the manag to the tabl but illadvis to actual do so your guest are famish and you do not want to get in their way

th chequ should be wild inflat it is your patriot duti to charg guest gratuiti and tax on all of the alreadi overpr food they sent backa friend was in town recent and want a great meal  although i had not been there i suggest christoph  when we arriv we decid to eat at the kitchen bar but after we order out drink we saw a coupl seat outsid and decid it was a perfect night for it  we ask the hostess if we could move and she begrudg agre  when we walk outsid she want to seat us at the tabl right next to the door i think as punish for this huge imposit even though there were plenti of other tabl avail  we ask to sit at the tabl farthest from the door to give us some space between the other diner and be in a better posit to watch the world go by  the hostess found this veri upset and tri to forc us to sit next to the door but after our protest final said it would be ok with her if we sat at the other tabl but that the server was not go to like it  she sat us in purgatori as steam escap from her ear and brought our drink but that was the last we saw of ani server  i did notic the hostess and some server were have quit a discuss about us and i heard one person say ok fine we will let them finish their drink  i wasnt exact sure what that meant but after 1520 minut of be left in the cold and while we were finish our drink the bread guy came by and we ask him to ask someon to get our check  a waiter final show up with a check and was bewild to find out we were leav  howev my impress was that they had decid not to serv us dinner and were simpli wait for us to get the message

that is a veri larg space christoph is pay rent on and that night the restaur was almost empti  i would think in the current econom environ his staff would have the good sens to bend over backward to accommod their guest but we were left with the impress that they felt they were do us a favor by be openumm we were stay at the palazzo and they said we still had to pay 20 to get into a club that look hella dead insid you must be on crack mr bouncer guy that need to get the stick outta your ass i aint pay for that shit 

id rather walk my ass to the v bar where it free and play better musictoday i ate here and the bean were way too salti to eat and the rice was almost the same but a littl more toler want to send it back but my husband insist that i let it go 

also one of the worker had a child run around the restaur  about 5 year old and he was touch everyth  silverwar napkin toothpick it was horribl the child was climb on the front counter and run back and forth and slide on the floor 

i may give the place anoth tri in the futur becaus i have had good food here in the past sorri filiberto first i would like to say that give a 1 yelp rate is a first for me second i would like to say that in everi past montesano visit and there have been mani begin with the first week they open this locat this eateri would have earn a fourstar or a fivestar each and everi time becaus the food is among the best italian fare i have ever enjoy in las vega and the place smell amaz incred 
third let me throw in that i have done year of mysteri shop privat investig and journal are my current trade im a twodecad public speaker instructor and note as a global expert in those topic i speakteach about in other word im no slouch

last night was differ and was among the worst experi i have ever had in a restaur  world over  it was the attitud and action of the staff right up to the manag let me explain and then you be the judge

i phone at 706 pm to call in a take out order the phone was answer on the second ring with a montesano pleas hold    and then the wait music interspers with the usual your busi is import to us pleas remain hold well be right back with you repeatingrepeatingrep messag  

at 715 pm have heard the loop 9 time and with unexpect hous compani wait for dinner i phone in hand drove over there i walk into a moder busi restaur by general standard with eight of the 14 tabl occupi still hold my cell phone in hand i approach the counter first in line yet wait anoth two minut to becom what i assum must be noninvisibleand ask to speak to the owner or manag as a previous loyal custom i want him to see what his employe were do  or betterst not do while i wait i place an order for two lasagna dinner  and paid for them  at 722 pm still on hold on my cell phone the owner came out at 734 pm i show him the phone and told him that i was still on hold and listen to their messag at that moment his employe pick it up and yup there i was on the other end of the call his respons near floor me

oh when we get busi like this we leav the phone on hold we have no time for them

at that moment anoth potenti custom enter the door and said i have been tri to call for 30 minut to place an order  i interject as i held up my timetick phone oh that must be my fault becaus theyv had me on hold look at screen twenti eight minut now the other previous loyal custom and i had both taken the time to drive down there to let them know that their phone were obvious non function  i consid that a random act of kindness

i told the owner that say can you pleas hold click is an indic that someon will grab the phone as soon as possibl  so  if they are too busi to come back to the call they should at least be respect and let the poor schmuck on the other end of the line know that they montesano have no intent of ever answer  and then just leav the damn thing off the hook also irrespons albeit far more consider of their custom own time restrict  

despit the assur when the girl took my ordermoney at 722 pm that shed get them out right away it was 757 pm when  the two littl white bag were hand to me thirti five more minut of my time 

but wait it get better wors along with the two carri out bag was a small loaf of bread that was includ for my inconveni someon there appar believ that a full hour of my time was worth label with a price tag of 139 a simpl but sincer apolog would have done wonder  stuff happen 

the food was not enjoy no sauc for the first time in an estim 20 visit to this establish the employe attitud was bad the manag attitud was reprehens and give such an idiot valu to a custom time ad a huge heap of insult to injuri believ me id rather have had honesti throughout the deal even the word ladi we think were so good that you can park your ass here for an entir hour in a half full restaurant

i had a group of 16 month dinner dine out club go in there on a midweek day in januari  now that will not happen general excel food is not enough when the attitud of manag is so entir cavali and disrespect sorri guy id rather eat 4star food in a respons busi establish than 5star food in a busi establish that show blatant disrespect for their pay customthis place was not veri good  

chines own and run the sushi chef are veri nice and good servic  

unfortun the fish isnt veri good  tri just about everi piec of fish they offer and the onli thing i would even consid eat again was the salmon and mayb the uni  usual these type of place make up for bad fish with creativ roll and we tri a few but didnt like ani of them  there were two that were suppos to be spici but not even slightdamn it i was pray that this place would be at least okay sinc it locat near mountain edg and there is noth out here im not exagger when i say the best part of the meal was when they notifi me that after the second beer the third would be free 

they mess up rice rice how the it was hard to even swallow the rice it was too dri uncl ben minut made rice has treat me better also no uni no toro despit it be pictur on an advertis and no super white or and other fatti fish that could make up for it

i ate a lot of nigiri on the ayc menu and noth realli tast fresh ive eaten a lot of sushi in my day and the fish here was notic differ in a bad way i know i know all you can eat sushi is not the way to go if you want good sushi under most circumst but this place was someth els i wasnt even go to tri a roll after the nigiri but i went with a half roll of someth on the spici side the roll that they present me with was someth u might find in an albertson wrap up in plastic to take to go mayb even wors 

let me emphas damn it i was realli hope despit the notsogreat review that this place would be okay or at least bearabl i wont be back veri simpli the place suck and that too bad

hop one day when i drive by in the futur there will be a big banner that say under new manag or someth becaus they must know they must know that theyr set standard that no one should be proud of 

sigh the whole experi was disappoint at least the free beer has help mask my utter discont with this place the servic wasnt bad but who the hell care when the food blow ass

i wont be back even tho it second away womp womp wompnow in the culinari wasteland that is laveen we decid to give the jumbo buffet a tri never again veri few food item were up to temperatur which explain my digest distress later on the sushi was sketchi look and tast old the meat was either dri out or fatti the steak on the mongolian bbq look as if it had been there a week the ice milk was hard and the other dessert were all prepackag and virtual flavorless this buffet is an epic fail in my opinioni am express my great disappoint with the servic i receiv from the district in octob 2009  

in the begin of octob i approach the district to see if it would be possibl to bring about 70 to 100 peopl on a thursday night at around 1030 pm  not onli did they say it would be great they would have drink special and have the happi hour menu avail to our guest and also the manag had told me and anoth colleagu there hard ani busi on thursday so it was great to have an organ interest in have a mixer at the district  thursday night came the level of custom servic and profession that the manag gave us was horribl  the way he treat me other and the fact that we brought about 70 to 100 peopl there itself was definit someth to rememb  not onli did they lie about accommod our larg group obvious the district could not do so nor did the manag team care to do so   the place was alreadi crowd with other guest which is great for them howev the manag never tri to accommod all our guest which they knew we were come for seat pass out menusth onli way peopl were abl to order if they were seat which they couldnt  some individu were wait a veri long time for a drink that cost 15 there were no drink special besid the beer and possibl the wine i never i saw the menu but i do know peopl were not happi with purchas a tini drink for 15 a pop the manag did speak to anoth individu with my guest at one point and had told him individu can not get drink special at the bar howev there was nowher to sit  the major of the tabl were alreadi pre occupi   also the execut director of the non profit organ that i work for had order just a dr pepper he gave the bartend a 20 receiv the drink and never receiv his chang when he ask the bartend the bartend took his name down and did not give him his chang  he has yet to receiv his chang for a dr pepper  

i never receiv a thank you for bring peopl to the district that night  it was veri disorgan and veri unprofession team at the district  
also the manag had said to me and the execut director  that we would receiv free valet park sinc we were at the district we had to pay over 40 for park   it was a veri frustrat night
 
bottom line we truli did not feel welcom at the district  i was put in the predica where i had to clear up confus and make my guest feel welcom  at one point had consid have a kickoff parti andor mixer at the district bring over 100 guest but after the custom servicetreat everyon receiv from the manag team and wait staff i am now reconsid ever util the district and the sheraton as for myself i was veri disappoint and had expect great service
thi is the funni part  i did receiv a week later an email from heinrich stasiuk district gm  veri insincer apolog the funni parth attach the email to the ongo insid convers between the manag state i was difficult sorri but you promis me certain thing should be abl to keep it also state in the email but they made good money from us if you are a busi or non profit organ tri to find a place to hold your mixer or dinner i hope either you reconsid or let them know youv read my review  sinc i was difficult im sure they will rememb me and the fact they probabl made about 3000 off of my guesti had heard of this bakeri from a competitor who hold shop in chandler  i have fond memori of delici cake from red ribbon from birthday parti of year past back home   filipino love to throw a parti and i swear cake from red ribbon were alway present  you can imagin the nostalgia that swept over me then when i final found this bakeshop situat near the food court in arizona mills

th shop look so pretti all lit up and all these entic bake good wrap in plasticcellophan with candyr print  hmm an alarm went off in my head after see them all wrap up  the shop look veri clean with welcom tabl and chair and my how love those cake roll look in the case  imagin then my disappoint upon read the nutrit info on these plasticwrap good to find that most if not all item are made with margarin not butter  these bake good fail the farm vs factori test ingredi list sound more like theyr mechanicallyproduc in a factori rather than be allnatur such as flour egg butter milk etc  befor sampl what i must admit was a delici morsel of mocha crunch cake i ask if the frost contain powder sugar  the sale clerk look at his cowork whom i assum is a manag who look at him then look at me and then said we think it whip cream  think  how can you not know what ingredi are use in the product you sell  i also inquir if ani item are made onsit  no he said  everyth is shippedtruck in and the onli prepar done at the bakeshop are the fri the fri of the empanada and the reheat of the siopao and noodl dish  

sorri red ribbon but this filipina onli want good bake with butter not margarin  i said bake not fri  with the except of the pie shell use in the egg pie all of the pastri serv at manila bakeri are made onsit so you wont find preserv list in the ingredi as well  

mi fond memori of those cake will have to be just that memori  all the better when it come to those twicedaili weighinmy second time there was a horribl experi gina herself told the waiter to stop tell us what good for the day menu and told him theyr young they dont know noth dont wast your time on them we were the first peopl to arriv and order and the smallest group but our food was last to come out and we began to notic that all the waiter waitress and gina herself was entertain other custom and left us out i will never go back there again especi after i have told gina myself that i did not enjoy the servic and she just walk awaysaturday 530pm sinc this was the first time id ever been here my first impress upon walk in was a pretti decent atmospher i like the huge bar and as soon as i sat down with 2 friend who were alreadi there the bartend immedi introduc herself and ask what i want so far so good

w were wait for 5 other peopl to celebr a friend birthday and when they show up we sat at a tabl at this point it was pretti dead in there we had our drink a food order taken fair quick by the waitress by this time it start to fill up a bit becaus they were show a ufc fight that start at 7pm

this is where thing began to go steadili south i dont know if their staf was mess up or what but our waitress dissappear for long stretch and get anyon to take our drink order was imposs it becam so bad that one of my friend actual got up and order a drink at the bar becaus he had an empti beer glass in front of him for over 20 minut he was scold by the piss off waitress when she final reappeared

th straw that broke the camel back and the main reason whi this place get the big ol one star is becaus of someth that i have never experienc in all of my 37 year at 8pm one hour after the fight start they start charg a 5 cover at the door no big deal lot of place do it the diffrenc here is the manag and one of the waitress start go around to everi tabl and to the bar and everi patron in the place and start charg a retroact cover charg are you friggin kid me

w had been there for 25 hour eat and drink and they charg us a 5 cover for the priviledg which came with a wrist band serious five buck isnt a lot of money but that seem just stupid retroact cover charg wow

needless to say i will never go back to this establish simpli on principl if this is how they treat their custom they must have a tough time get repeat busi manag if you read this you need to get your shit togeth and abolish that charg a cover at the door at 8pm for new folk arriv specifiaclli to suck down some water and watch the fight understood charg a parti of 8 the same after we had been there for over 2 hour run up over a 250 bill as well as all the other folk who were in there too that just bad busi practicquit a few peopl have post their glow review of this particular restaur and i cant help but wonder if im on a bad acid trip or these peopl have never been outsid of their special box  

ive got perman major wang for pad see ew and sala thai version definit put the ewwwwwww in it  that was some serious sour overcook squishi noodl  

i also order two veggi spring roll and was surpris to find that they resembl a wet paper towel wrap around a bunch of lettuc  so whi would anyon purpos put wet paper towel and lettuc in their mouth
wel i like to live danger and ill tri anyth onc  

it turn out the sauc is pretti good but no amount of good tast sauc can save lettuc wrap in wet paper towels

w also tri two other dish a curri type deal that i cant realli rememb and some thai fri rice  the thai fri rice was an abomin  

in fact bandung has much better thai fri rice and other thai dish and at the same cost as sala thai  

final yes these peopl are friggin slowwwwww and you know it would be ok if the food was worth it but sour overcook food and wet paper towel spring roll is notmy husband  i have been avid bww goer ever sinc we move to gilbert 3 year ago we frequent the mcqueen  elliot locat almost onc a week the entir time we live nearbi  the wing are awesom and it the best place to watch ani kind of sport everi time friend come in town we take them to thursday night 50 wing  3 youcallit

it was 1230 am and we were drive nearbi this locat i wasnt sure what time they close so i look up the number on my phone quick and call to ask someon answer the phone and said we close at 1 we knew we were cut it close but were crave wing so we decid we would run in order wing togo have one round of drink while they were be cook and make it out right at close we have all work in the servic industri so we are veri cogniz of common restaur courtesi and alway tip extrem well

when we walk in we were immedi face with the manag shana i believ who veri rude said we are close my husband look at his phone and said it is onli 1240 and we just call and someon told us you close at 1 she said she was inde the person who answer the phone and her clock actual said it was 1255 and they are close we explain our intent of order togo and have one drink and she again veri rude  said the bar was absolut off limit they did last call 20 minut ago and if we had to order food it we would be wait for awhil becaus she would have to refir up the kitchen and get everyth back out sinc it all been clean up alreadi 

at this point we had no intent of stay and were realli offend at how we were be treat we calm explain we would have appreci if she had been truth with us on the phone if she had simpli repli that they close at 1 but the kitchen has alreadi clean up and last call for the bar was 20 minut ago we would not have even wast the time to drive there 
she did not apolog and was still speak to us with a ridicul attitud everyon was frustrat at this point and as we start to a leav a server that had walk up earlier call my husband an asshol this was complet appal so unnecessari absolut undeserv and insan unprofession 

we will never go back to this locat if you are crave bww stop in to the mcqueen  elliot locat where all of the staff are super friend accommod and professionwow  just wow  total and utter overr  i realli want to believ the hype and hysteria  i realli did 

mi best friend and i went there last week  the menu was melon soup with lime sorbet heirloom tomato and chees salad and either ribey or curri fish  

first the atmospher is fantast realli quaint and romant the server were well mean too  

first cours the amus bouch soup it was about two tabl spoon of melon smoothi that anyon with a vitamix can make  oh but it had a dollop of lime sorbet on top and a color swirl of who care  it was like get dessert as appet but much less satisfying

second cours the heirloom tomato and super sprout phenomenon salad  
it had three  one quarter inch thick half moon slice of tomato three piec of chees and three quarter of a pound of sprout of some über micro green  but to be fair it did have a shmear of some past on the plate  basic tasteless tomato were less than ripe and still veri hard   realli 5500 for three slice of tomato chees and a hand of green call me crazi but the valu for a a foodi for food that tast like my kindergartn made it is just not there  fail number two  

third cours entre  i had the ribey and my friend had the curri fish  the ribey was unlik ani ribey ive had  it frank wasnt ribey  it was three medallion of lean beef over black lentil and drizzl with who care wine reduct  again veri lack on flavor contrast and flavor  but serious folk who doesnt love a bite of top round with a delici bland mouth of lentil to deaden all your tast bud  oh and befor i forget after we order my friend note to me they didnt ask how you want your steak cook  so the next time the server came round we ask whi and said i want it rare  the server who i think is in train bc he seem to have to ask the other server everyth  which is fine better sad than sorri there a sometim steep learn curv in fine dine said the steak is cook medium rare the way the chef want it  now i havent work with gordon ramsey but i bet you a million dollar that hed ask the patron for his opinion on the matter  that said i still realli think he was in train and forgot to ask and didnt want to go back to the kitchen and get yell at for not ask etc  been there myself  fine medium rare will do just fine  the chef said so  

mi friend curri fish i total forgot what type of fish but i think it was mahi mahi was the best dish of the night  but it too was not that impress   i think i would rather hit male for fish in curri sauc  and again it had some lentil bland mound under the fish  

the final cours was dessert  we order two lagavulin 16s on the rock it took a minut becaus the server had to ask the lead server to talk to is about scotch option to go with theoh wait the dessert was so unmemor i forgot what it was  i liter cant rememb what it was  but i do rememb be unimpress and say to my friend the first cours soup wouldv been a better dessert  

last the bill  the night befor we ate at mastro in scottsdal and had  a much much better bill to food ratio  and i am a raven foodi and i understand small cours and i know it not a steak hous  my point here is that at the most expens steakhous in scottsdal where the ribey is 70 dollar or so and you know you are be plunder for meat you could buy at aj and grill or put in your salamand you are still get tastier food and more bang for your buck  or likewis if you went to binkley in cave creek your money would be so much better spent  food doesnt get mask and duct tape with lentil there  and you could do 3 or 5 or 7 cours or just order off the menu and chef binkley will take the time to ask if there is ani special accommod for allergi tast profil etc that he need to chang or modifi for you  oh and it tast amaz so you get your money worth  at cafe monarch where the chef is king they must be do summer budget cut and dial the food down a notch as the snow bird leav and the local get the tabl scrap or mayb it was an off night or mayb they just serv food that way i dont know but frank it suck  total and utter overr and unimpress  
oh and the ice cube for our scotch cost 200 each  that right two dollar for frozen water put into a rock glass  serious the budget must be realli out of balanci love crepe and as such i realli want to tri this place out so i convinc my wife to go with me for lunch shes been befor and she warn me about the servic but i figur it was just a fluke and it would be fine suffic it to say we came in at lunch time around 11 and the place wasnt even that busi mayb 15 peopl the sign said to seat ourselv so we did and there we sat unacknowledg for a good 10min not even so much as a hello or a well be right with you i think i even saw one of the waiter sit down watch the tv i even saw custom get up to refil their own water and get napkin for themselv from waiter station so we left without anyon even notic and we will not be return 

im the kind of guy that like to recommend place to his friend and i will not be recommend this establish this is how you lose custom so take notethis was our second stop on our mekong food crawl after wait for about 15 minut with one person ahead of us we final place our order i cant tell you how close we were to walk out and just go across the street to ace well we persevered

her is whi the food take so long to come out they que the order up and tri to make all like dish at the same time no matter how long youv been there if you order peddler soup and 4 tabl behind you order peddler soup you will be wait until they get to that dish on the ticket it bullshit 

anyway one order came out was the pork chop and rice box while the pork chop look good it was pretti lame tea egg was fine but it was just a tea egg the cabbag salad was warm and pretti boring

aft about 15 minut the other 2 dish arriv the beef stew over rice was prepar in this over thick gelatin goo while the meat textur was good the overal flavor and appear was pretti nasti the other dish chicken in chile was pretti ordinari and wasnt spici at all kinf of surpris sinc the dish was cover in chile though i think they may have been old 

even the boba thai tea was thin water down and not veri good was so not worth the wait after a few bite of each we end up leav and went across the street to ace for some decent asian food 

what a complet wast of timenot hot not even warm stone cold kinda hard not veri fresh tast hella sweet unsatisfi 

serious they are damag their brand by open this type of store there is no differ between the roosevelt store and pick up a box at the circl k what next a littl debbi store front with a drive through

i needless fear that this locat would spell a serious loss of busi for our nearbi rainbow donut i now appreci them even more by comparison to krispi kreme32910

came here after work as mom need to do some light shop at mekong supermarket  sinc it was alreadi 815p she start groceryshop while i place an order for spring roll which mom speciallyrequest and a combin pho  ive alway wonder if the meatbal dish was ani good so i order that too  in less than 10 minut our dish were readi so i text mom to come on over

mom didnt realli enjoy the fresh roll she onli had half of one and the other sat in the fridg for three day until i toss it out  we also didnt enjoy the meatbal platter  what a wast  terribl present unflatt color couldv use some sear action to give the slice a nice crust horrid textur clammyrubberi and veri bland in flavor  two bite and i wonder who would ever order this again  not us  thank the pho save the even  that is until it becam quit clear from the heighten energi level of the clean crew that they were anxious to close for the even  we were tri to eat as fast as we could until i final look at my watch and note it was onli 845p  what the  then i rememb that the last time we were there we were treat the same way too but it was understand sinc it was closer to 9p then

sorri com tam but lacklust spring roll ghast meatbal dish and rush us when there was still plenti of time are two reason too mani not to come backsorri have to vent on this one i love fate for year now close but my first ever prima donna chef moment dure my first visit to sen mean it sad a no go from now on a dish arriv sprinkl with chop peanut which im high allerg to veri common allergi i gave it to my friend but the server nice offer to have it remad without so we said sure thank she came back a few moment later to say the chef refus to make it without it was pretti much a big cold smack in the face and ruin the night but the worst part was my serious suggest to make sure they note the dish had peanut in the menu becaus it realli danger and could kill someon was total brush off chop peanut look like chop garlic or onion been burn befor with 12 hour of pure hell afterward anyway probabl not of interest to most diner but for us it was a veri negat experi never to be repeatsooo disappoint arriv here yesterday with a friend at about 415pm seat prompt an over bubbl petit girl approach our tabl you know the kind tgi friday flare type speak in cheerlead tone well call her bubbl let us know our server would be with us in a minut right as our server arriv  there were mayb 5 tabl sat includ our in all area of the restaur and ill be damn if our poor server wasnt wait on everi singl one of them which explain whi she wasnt veri attent not realli her faultour food did arriv in a time fashion deliv by bubbl my friend had order the squash casserol and had ask if bread was avail for her to order and the attitud and outright snotti of bubbl next comment decid the gratuiti and the fact we will never go back she said  we dont have bread this isnt the outback you should have seen the look on our face  she then catch herself and say we have pita and my friend stae nevermind that not what i was look for bubbl goe away and come back with an order of pita anyway we sat in silenc for a good 5 minut apal at that littl bitch outburst as a manag i would have fire her on the spot for speak to a patron in that manner 

after the incid and our meal was finish the plate were clear and we satand sat while our server tend to the rest of her tabl meanwhil there are 5 server do sidework right in front of us includ bubbl who mind you was lean over the sidework tabl laugh and not help her cowork at all we made eye contact with sever of them hope they would notic we were look for our server and noth we had actual want dessert but by the time our server final show we just want to leav im sure our server would have been great had she had ani form of assist from her cowork but the snotti of the self righteous self entitl bubbl was inexcusable

im sure your wonder about the food it decent but not anyth amazingtoo mani restaur in phoenix to come back here for their food let alon to be talk down to by the staff

oh and also we were told their tomato are flown in from tuscani serious in this economi your fli tomato in from itali and not support your local marketsfailwhenev im on a night out on georg street we alway pay candi bar a visit they do pretti cheap cocktail so that reason enough for me so when i was invit to my friend hen do with 13 girl from england and i was told wed be head to candi for a cocktail class and food i thought this would be the perfect venu it wasnt

th girl who organis it had gone into candi a coupl week previous and book the cocktail class when we walk in last saturday even it was soon made appar that they never actual wrote down the book they knew about it but hadnt got anyth prepar after much discuss they final agre to squeez us in for the class but ask if we would eat our food first they clear some space for us to sit down and eat and in the mean time offer us drink but didnt offer them on the hous even though they had clear realli mess up we suggest that they mayb should be on the hous and they agreed

when we sat down for food we order wine this was clear a veri difficult order as they came back multipl time ask what wed order then they brought us the wrong order this kept happening

a for the food i know it is all veri cheap burger for around a fiver so i didnt expect much but i did expect it to be edibl to start with i had potato wedg with a sour cream and chive dip they were ok but i was starv but there were no chive in the sour cream for my main cours i chose the turkey burger i was describ as be serv on a squishi bun this was not the case the bun was toast and complet rock solid so it just crumbl apart the slab of turkey in the bun was complet over cook dri and cold

when we eventu got round to the cocktail make class the guy who was run it an aussi guy was love and the class was realli fun we all made three cocktail each and he was veri patient with 14 excit ladies

so overal the class was great but the rest was a disast the fact that they made littl effort to compens for their mistak made it seem like they didnt care they had 14 girl there all will to spend lot of money and they made no effortim done im realli 100 done with this place

cam here again last week for lunch and it was ridicul first of all the wait staff is alway pretti abysm but this was reach new low the waitress hard paid us ani attent even though the place was empti and when her friend show up with her babi she merrili join her at the tabl and sat down to chat and text ignor her tables

th sushi disgust the salmon i order had those grey stripe of meat on it the one you cant bite through it also smell and tast less than fresh the tuna i had was chewi and dri out it tast like a particular unappet version of jerki made of tuna when you felt like sushi 

just no dont go here i know i know it seem like good money for not bad sushi but i think ive figur out what theyr do when the joint is relat book full they have someon in the kitchen who sort of know what theyr do but for lunch on a tuesday no such luck i dont know who was in the kitchen but they should be fire tout de suit these peopl have no idea what sushi is or how it made

aft about a dozen visit over the past two year i can honest advic you steer clear get the hell out of dodg go to tang instead just noone of the worst happi hour in vegasor anywher for that matter we were tempt by this hh becaus it start at 200pm and we had some time to kill wait for friend to arriv in town the bartend was pleasant enough the 5 drink menu is veri limitedsangria shot of jose beer well drink what mexican restaur hh doe not includ a hh margarita appar onli this onelam the 5 food menu is also pretti limit while we were decid what to order we munch on some chip and salsa we order the hot wing nacho and two rum and coke becaus i dont do shot of jose and there was no hh margaritasup lame the drink were small but the chip and salsa are realli good here is the lowdown on the food

nacho 5  ughhow can you ruin nacho a veri small bowl of chip cover in a tasteless black bean past i will let you use your imagin about what this dark black past look like and an orang substanc that tast like chees in a can the top was spars and onli cover the top layer of chip which i guess is a good thing becaus it was vile i have honest had better nacho from ampm these were borderlin disgust and after two chip i had to stop eat them

thi happi hour fail to make me happi and actual made me a littl sad and angri hh fail

avoid avoid avoidi went to the restaur and my parti spent over 300 my phone was stolen in the restroom with the district manag alex less than 5 ft away i ask for him to pleas make an announc or call my ph to see whom answer he refus state  it would kill his ambianc and walk away he refus to allow me to use the restaur phone to call the polic to file a report he refus to provid me with the ownersw name or ani contact info he did not allow his staff to give me their name the waitress actual said he was horribl to work with and apolog to me but she need her job so she could not side with me in front of him actual alex call the polic on me as a trespass the polic apolog to me when they arriv alex lie to the polic and treat me like a dog i will never frequent that restaur againi have been a frequent goer to this restaur while live in the citi and while the food and drink are great the servic is absolut terribl i have never met such an over arrog and pride staff they feel that as long as you have a minor issu it is your fault and not their for exampl my friend specif ask for the midnight martini it is 1202 pm she serv us full size martini my friend was a littl concern that the waitress didnt hear us correct and to make sure we were not be charg full price she flag the waitress over to which she say those are full price martini my friend proceed to state that we have specif request midnight martini to which the waitress respond i didnt hear you so instead of apolog for the misunderstand and offer the midnight special she retali and get defens becaus of her incompet we request to speak to the manag to which he tower over the tabl and ask what go on here oh hi nice to see you too he didnt even introduc himself proper nor profession i was so turn off by the negat and defens attitud that i have just about had it with that place it is not the first time i have receiv this poor servic and they need to get off their high hors and get their game togeth sorri im not sorri hanni but were go to have to part ways

what is a huge turn off of all is know that after scroll through these review 1 out 5 custom are veri unhappi with the servic provid and almost all have the same context server and waitstaff are rude 

i am plead out to the owner of hanni for the sake of your great restaur pleas hire new manag and waitstaff they are make you look horriblif i could give them no star i would

w have eaten at the bluburg locat on jomax and had a great experi  good food decent servic no complaint so when a new locat open up around the corner from our hous we decid to check it out with our neighbor and their 2 kids

i arriv first and went to put our name in for a tabl but instead i wait  and wait  and wait some more  the hostess final came over and when i request a tabl for 4 adult and 2 kid she let out a sigh and told me that they were complet back up and could not seat us  confus i scan the dine room and count no less than 4 empti tabl and 3 teenag waiter mill around aimless  dude the hostess hasnt even met my neighbor kid yet and she was alreadi throw us out  at this time the rest of my parti arriv and i let them know what the hostess told me  my husband walk over to her and ask whi she wouldnt seat us mention the open tabl  the hostess told us that they were short staf and back up in the kitchen but she will seat us anyway  she also ad that we would get no servic not even water for 20 minut or more  wtf  

i have never in my life encount such a thing in ani restaur  especi one that was newli open the smell of fresh paint still in the air  certain not the way to treat potenti custom  instead of stick around and starv we all end up at pei wei a few step away

appar we werent the onli one annoy with the rude of bluburg  within minut of us sit down at pei wei 3 other group from bluburg walk through the door  they got tire of wait as well

so cant comment of the food at this particular locat but the attitud that we got there was so atroci that we will not be go back  everif i could give this place less than one star i would my famili and i had the worst experi ever in this restaur my friend and i frequent the kona at scottsdal fashion squar and we love them so when we were look for dinner by our hous my dad suggest we go to this kona i jump at the opportun big mistak 

we walk into the restaur and after a few minut were greet by a hostess she said it would onli be about 10 minut which was fine with us so we wait about 10 minut later i look around and there were sever open tabl i figur the server just need a moment to catch up so we continu to wait howev 20 minut after we were still wait the hostess said she would bus the tabl and we would be seat short she start buse the tabl then left to talk to a gentleman who i am assum was the manag after talk to him she finish buse the tabl look around the front room i could see at least 5 open tabl howev we were still not taken to the tabl she had just finish clean off 

after wait for over 30 minut she final took us to our tabl where the hostess took our drink order say our server would be right with us the server stop by about 5 minut later to say she would be right with us where we wait for 10 addit minut for someon to take our order needless to say after spend almost an hour be ignor and not given servic we decid they did not want not did they deserv our busi we left 5 on the tabl to cover the soft drink order and left 

the absolut lack of organ and custom servic at this locat is appal and manag need to serious reevalu their practic we will never be backbe warn if you are think of purchas one of the live social deal coupon that came out in today email this busi is out of busi  they have not been pay their bill tax includ and basic tri to scam the system  check the citi of peoria court record they were formal evict in octob and have known they would not be in busi to see these coupon use  i post someth on facebook about it and they prompt remov it and block me  they know what i am say is true and they want to continu to perpetr the fraud

so if you want to wast your money go ahead and purchas one but just so you know live social has been contact  below is what i post on fb earlier

just to set the record straight when you dont pay your oblig like rent and tax you give up the right to be in busi have said the landlord sold the build is not true get your fact straight and dont mislead the public you need to pay your bill and if you are use the live social deal to get the money back you have been report to them as have gone out of busison of fuck bitch 

three order of food and when we pull up to the drivethru window and ask to add a taco to the order we were told by the young man work the drivethru window that no there are no extra taco they are made to order yeah we want to order one he then respond by say we cannot add ani food to our alreadi exist order and that if we want to add ani food to the order that we would have to exit the drivethru and drive back around and get back in line again no joke he said no serious you cant order a taco it busi you understand no i dont understand your busi is to sell me arteryclog food and you are refus to do so to top it off when i call later to talk to the manag a cowork answer the phone giggl and then final said uhhh ehh  hello 
hi is this jack in the box
uhhh yeah 
look like jitb need to step it up on the employe train manualedit to add good they close no surprise

i would like to add to michael ds comment much of which echo my experi with next

rec i went there dure a bellyd perform the hour are clear post as be open until 10pm i show up around 945pm the place had at least two dozen peopl in it watch bellyd as well as a few tabl where folk were finish eat a reason person would assum they were still open for busi given all of this yes well silli me the door was lock a custom open the door and let me in

then i walk up to the counter foolish think that someon would sell me a coffe or at least have the courtesi to tell me that they were not serv ani longer i stood there like an idiot for 3 full minut while about the entir staff walk right by me and avoid make eye contact rufkm wow there was also a woman whom i assum to be either the owner or the manag judg by the way she was dress her imperi attitud and utter refus to make eye contact with ani of us or even say a goddamn word of greet to myself or anybodi it was like it was a huge imposit on her that anybodi was still there

i also let in two other peopl about five minut after i show up 950pm they also want coffe and sinc nobodi at next coffe could be bother to greet those horribl painintheass custom who had the temer to show up befor close time without give prior notic to the staff it was up to me to tell them that the rude jerkfac staff not onli was not go to sell them squat even though it was 10 minut shi of their post close time they wouldnt even have the courtesi to say sorri no servic now 

short after 10pm there was anoth woman who was there who want to buy someth to eat they have plenti of prepackag readi to go food there all it would have taken is one person with the initi to take her 7 or 8 and hand her the food nobodi had to break out the bread or meat or whatev which had been put away but of cours nobodi could be bother to take her money and it would have been a huge imposit to mess with cash after they put away the cash drawer im sure it would have been way too much to expect them to sell her the food and just put the money asid and ring it up the next day

th peopl at next coffe just didnt give a damn

i run my own busi and i have also work in food servic i have never ever ever run across a restaur owner who would lock the door 15 minut or more prior to the post close time and refus to serv ani food or drink when there are still over two dozen peopl in the restaur sever of whom were will to buy more coffe and food in fact i am posit that it would be a fire offens at ani of the restaur i work at to act like this

thi particular even the rude peopl at next gave up easili 20 of busi and possibl more becaus im not count the over two dozen peopl still mill around when the perform end who might have want to pick up someth for the road in fact i was hungri and might even have bought some of their prepar food for the road

in fact most of the restauranteur i have work for would glad take your money and serv you someth that takeandgo if you show up even 10 minut after close becaus they were good businesspeopl and they gave a damn about the custom and about make money unlik the peopl run next who seem to have more import thing to do than you know their jobs

20 may not sound like much but multipli that by howev mani night a  month they pull this crap that a few hundr buck a month and a few thousand dollar a year that the kind of money that make a differ between stay afloat or not sometim not to mention the ill will this kind of rude and clueless behavior creat which lead to who know how mani lost sale in the future

mayb next is do so well that they can afford to treat custom like sht  and stay afloat if so good for them must be nice to be abl to get by with such arrog behavior in this economi i wish i could give them negat bazillion starthis place is a ripoff the manag rose goe to the frys down the street and buy the sandwich they sell for 5 take them to her shop cut them into quarter and put a markup on them all their food come from the deli at frys 
save yourself some money and buy it fresh yourself from the groceri storeshort version if i hadnt ever eaten at texa de brazil mayb this would have gotten 2 star if the price reflect the qualiti of the food they gave me in ani way mayb it would have gotten 3 neither of those are the case cheap offtast meat poor season and cook staff that doesnt know rare from well done tini and unappet salad bar mediocr dessert ridicul expens never again

let me start with the most ridicul part of the night i ask them to send over the guy with the filet mignon and they said they dont serv filet if your go to charg me 77person for tini nugget of meat and 10drink not have a filet mignon is unaccept i wouldnt come back for that alone

w here for new year eve the meat were poor and inconsist season some too littl some too much the server have absolut no idea what level their meat are cook to my fiancé ask for a piec medium and got barelyevencook rare i ask for a piec medium and got shoeleath well done everi meat we ask for was ask for medium and i dont think i got an actual medium piec all night 

the salad bar is extrem small and choic are limit and  unlik texa de brazil mani of the item are also prepar item like soup which make the salad portion of the salad bar even smaller 

after midnight the salad bar turn into a dessert bar that was an awesom idea except the onli thing that tast ani good were the sorbet cup and they never onc restock them my tabl of four got to share two tini melonballers scoop between us and no matter how mani time we check they never brought ani more out

they did have a dj and i cant complain about him although im not a big dj person so i couldnt tell you if he was good or bad hes just background music to me 

there no coat rack not realli someth you see a lot of in vega i know but it 30° outsid and i saw a lot of coat drape over extra chair in the flower across lapsthi doesnt have anyth to do with my 1star rate but it realli annoy me

ther are two kind of staff here as far as im concern the meatbear and everybodi els regardless of my issu with the meat bearer complet lost on rare medium etc relat inattent the rest of the staff was excel our waitress was alway check up on us our drink were never empti the hostess were polit and even came to get us from the bar while we wait for our tabl instead of have us stand in the recept area whi dont they have buzzer anyway no matter they did an admir job the old fashion way in spite of all of this my experi was definit negat which is a shame becaus i was realli hope to have a place like texa de brazil on my end of town

they brought us out a 20 gift card at the end of the night and the waitress said that it was good for our next visit if we just follow the instruct on the back my friend hand it to me sinc he didnt plan on ever come back i left it on the tabl with the check becaus i dont plan on ever come back either neither of us even bother to read the instructi and my wife dine here this evening
     i felt the price is a bit over the top
     the burger were somewhatok  not the fantast  i was expect     
     
for the price  i would of expect the burger  to be hand formed
th burger were not dri  just not juici                

the tabl that seat two individu are to small  bare room for the plates

our server was a young person   who spent her time in the backroom
                           so our srevic was  mediocre

                  overal i was disappoint with our experience

mi ethic  my standards
everi busi start with one star  get more  has to be earnmy girlfriend doe not eat gluten so we decid to tri indulg for lunch as they had a veri extens gluten free menu i had everi intent on buy a carnivor burger howev decid to tri a veggi burger instead if the name of the restaur has burger in it i am assum a burger of the veggi varieti would be fine as well i even ask the server if it was a good veggi burger or if i should order someth els she said we have veri good veggi burger cough riiiiight  

our server was veri prompt and friend and suggest if we were go to order fri off the gluten free menu we should do so earli as they take longer to prepar so we order them in advancebak not fri  she came back to take our actual order and not 3 minut later brought out the fri befor the burger ok a bit earli fine by me the fri were soft in mani place and burnt in other i thought there were meh my girlfriend thought they were gross 

a littl while later my veggi burger was serv  a shrivel up cowpi slap between two bun with leaf of lettuc and onion perch on top a pickl and some carrot shred garnish the plate the server saw my confus express and said oh we dont put anyth on the veggi burger but if you want some ketchup or mustard serious no aioli no spread no hummus or anyth to damp down this dri up patti of cardboard  i ate half of it primarili becaus it kept fall apart noth was use as a binder appar i had to eat it with a fork but a spoon would have been better it was so bad i would have prefer one of those frozen bocca or morn star veggi patti for 9 it was such a joke 

mi girlfriend gluten free burger was a 12 burger on a salad she ask for guacamol and ask if she should write it on the build your own burger menu pad they give you the server said nope i will rememb guess who forgot the guac her burger look lacklust and somehow a dill pickl on a salad seem wrong

this place is garbag  ill be put it on everi form of media i know that this place can go straight to hellive been a custom of blanco for quit a while now it a goto place for girl night or a quick bite with my hubbi unfortun blanco has lost both my husband and i as patrons

on a recent saturday night we were crave a delici chees crisp and pitcher of sangria after we had learn our lesson on weekend past my husband call ahead for seat and we were inform it would be 45 minut no big deal and noth we didnt expect 

an hour after our call in time and wait in the restaur for 30 minut i approach the hostess ask where we were on the list she inform me it would be just a bit longer and they were work to get us a tabl half an hour after that no tabl i polit approach again and it was clear that we had been skip mark off the list and forgotten the hostess state the next tabl would be our and to give them just a few more minut when i went to sit back down the coupl sit next to us were seat infuri we both decid it was time to leav my husband gave our pager back and the hostess stood there like deer in the headlight they said sorri but made no attempt to make the situat right 

i find this type of thing to be complet unaccept we were patient understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaur in return we were greet with lousi custom servic and no tabl on the plus side we discov a new restaur right across the way we have been to multipl time now thank for the help blancothe onli thing that bring me to this place is starvat it is either jack in the box starbuck or dunkin within walk distanc for breakfast when i am run to late to work to make my own i have visit this locat 3 time and each time i leav i want to punch myself in the face for going

her are the reason whi i will eat my shoe befor ventur to dunkin donut again

you make your own coffe  doesnt sound so bad right  wrong
on each of my 3 visit they have been out of almost everyth coffe creamer sugar straw when i ask the counter worker to refil the coffe she sigh and then disappear in back for 10 minut the back room is the size of a larg closet what could possibl take so long
hygien i saw a man sneez in to his coffe and then get a refil touch his cup to the spout on the coffe machin gross the counter are fill with trash and spillag 
they charg you more for ice coffe this is ridicul it is the same coffe they brew then let cool whi doe that cost more 
a man walk in and ask what size the 50 cent coffe is the girl look at him and say it say it on the sign she is either to dumb to rememb or a serious smart ass 

do yourself a favor do not go to this locatif the lodg didnt over charg my card 3 visit in a row i would recommend this place instead i have to expos them for the repeat credit card error they have made mayb this will forc them to hire some honest server but probabl not this has also happen to two of my other friend sever time as well veri disappoint 

this past saturday we went to the lodg at about midnight for some late night snack we order 30 worth of food and drink my friend and i split the bill so about 20 each after tip  she messag me today to see if i was bill for the meal becaus her card was charg 30 i check my account and they charg me 40 and these were post charg not pend  this has happen too mani time and everi time i have to call sever time to disput it and a manag never happen to be around  at this point im convinc that their server do this intent in hope that peopl will be too drunk to rememb what they did or leav their receipt behind so they cant disput it  well i definit was not drunk and i know i was rip off  

you have lost a custom becaus of your bad busi practic and dishonest serverterribl visit on wednesday night walk in and both hostess just stare at me no hello no noth so i grab a seat at the bar the bartend was actual great but unfortun for her the lack of leadership from the manag is caus the standard of grimaldi to plummet my pizza came out luke warm and chees bare melt i ask for it to be crispi when the bartend ask if i want it fix i ask her to point out her manag guess who it was the same person who sent out my undercook pizza the younger women who was in charg of the entir place is send out a sub par product she did not even look the part of a manger no profession attir poor attitud and a clear lack of standard whi would i have sent it back to get the same product no wonder the staff doesnt care the manger doesnt unfortun i wont be return to grimaldiworst burrito ever  i come from mission in sf so my bar is high  still i think it not a edibl burrito what they serv here  at your own riskmy husband jim w teas me becaus i onli have one and five star review  i guess that what it take to motiv me  appar i was realli motiv this morn at mcdonalds

no one over the age of eight goe to mcdonald for the food  we either go becaus it quick sometim or cheap not anymor or conveni or becaus we are crave that childhood food memori  so jim and i met there this morn  score one for conveni for a quick snack and chat about the week

whil were wait for the food i notic a sign that say they have free sampl on monday morn  i was fascin by this  sinc when has mcdonald offer sampl  and who hasnt tri their potato and need to know what they tast like  who doesnt know the tast of crunchi greas without a remind  so curios get the better of me i ask for a sampl  i realli want to see what it was  that when i was remind where exact i was

i was told that there was no way i could have a sampl  when i inquir whi that was i was inform that the person accompani me had order what they were sampling

oh

though most yelper know my prolif yelper husband this woman did not  in fact she had no idea who he was in relat to me  he could have been my husband but he could just as easili been an anal colleagu who would rather die than allow me to sampl his food which i assum was the implic in her refusal

now i acknowledg that this is a ridicul noth of an issu  but these day i run into more and more silli littl annoy and i just couldnt let this one pass  you see the woman was veri satisfi with herself as if i was tri to get over on the man ie mcdonald and she thwart me  it just so stupid  so i guess they save themselv a quarter of a hash brown but they got this nifti review instead

a to the biscuit i did eat well  it was mcdonaldthis is a busi dirti walmart and you shoud stay away from it shop at a targetvalentin day and what can be better than a wonder night out with my beauti wife  we book reserv at fogo de chao and were look forward to a wonder even  we arriv prompt for our reserv and were warm greet by a 20 minut wait stand in an overcrowd lobbi  we overheard the hostess tell anoth patron that fogo was run behind becaus peopl were take longer than expect to eat  i guess they did not account for folk actual want to enjoy their meal and their convers on valentin day  

we were taken to our tabl and our waiter greet us with man i am tire cant wait until by shift end    sorri for the inconveni  we will tri not to ask too much of you   well i think he read my thought becaus we went to the salad bar and return to find that we still did not have our drink includ water or fork  we did a quick check to see in anyon els was eat with their hand as part of the cultur experi  but they had fork and water so we wait  and wait final we flag down a meat chef who kind gave use the equip necessari to begin our meal  

the food was averag  the steak were great but the lamb was gamey and the chicken was averag and a bit dri   the roll were beauti prepar and had an interest textur  

we were invit to tri their dessert but decid that we did not want to overstay our welcom  so we polit ask for our check and wait we did pass the time watch the waiter flip through the bill from other custom evalu their tip like the ir agent check tax return  

to be serious for a moment for the price of this restaur we expect a more classic dine experi with a profession attent wait staff etc howev it may have just been a over overcrowd sinc it was valentin day   yet that is exact whi we pick this establish in the first placevega yelper you all have way too low standard i cant trust your recommend here

i went here with my husband and some of his cowork and it was definit below mediocr across the board

food
with great food i can overlook just about all other aspect of a dine experi unfortun off the strip did not have great food or even good for that matter the ingredi and prepar were all thing i could make at home noth was veri innov although mani dish were over complex with the addit of a ton of ingredi i think an effect dish embrac simplic and transform minim ingredi rather than add a truckload in addit a pet peev of mine is when restaur dont disclos on the menu or by the waiter what will show up on my plate and this place was a major offend of that i dont need the secret recip im just look for an idea of major flavor and ingredients
for exampl the caesar salad dress was so strong flavor of raw garlic not even roast to get the flavor without the whoofactor that i couldnt eat more than two bite i love garlic i eat it raw in slice as i cook i roast it and have it with a meal i am obsess with the stink rose in san francisco a restaur dedic to the obscen use of garlic but ton and ton of raw garlic in a caesar dress is realli just offens and to boot the menu made no mention at all of a garlici caesar
anoth exampl of over complex food without prior warn on the menu was the mash potato they had crispi piec of burn chees surround the serv which im not a huge fan of but i know some peopl like it but they also had someth els in them that i still cant place it was more of a scent than a flavor and honest it smell like just a hint of artifici vanilla extract or some sort of pastri like scent after i point it out other peopl detect it too im still tri to figur it out mascarpon someon drop some cheesecak in the mash potato pan some over ambiti chef attempt vanilla mash potato sound bizarr becaus it was and it was anoth part of my meal i onli had a coupl bite of
th fresh bake bread was one of those half cook loav from the groceri store that you stick in the oven fresh half bake except it was a littl stale like it sat under a warmer or someth so mayb just half baked
th crabcak use realli realli realli low grade crab meat with not a hint of lump and possibl a hint of fish it could just be becaus im from new england but i dont find crabcak without lump meat even worth eating
th pesto garlic bread contain not even a hint of pesto just more overwhelm garlic
oh and their famous cheesecak was noth to write home about

atmosphere
they need to hire a decor  or someth they had bare beig wall with a singl paint although i did see two paint sit on the ground look like they need to be hung the place had plain old recess light cafe tabl with cheapo diner style chair no booth and no mirror no soap and no towel in the ladi room  no ecoutr in the ladi room would be inexcus at denni but at a place run about 50person it aw 

service
first on the good  the male waiter was on the ball he accident brought me the wrong veget and correct his mistak without me point it out he was decent nice and look profession in a brand shirt
howev the femal waitress seem like they belong in a differ restaur entir one was wear just a tanktop which seem way inappropri for a place where mani custom were wear buttondown and nice pant the other was wear a glitteri pbr hat and select call peopl hon which i find even more annoy than call everyon hon the hon at the tabl were me the onli femal with our parti and two of the younger guy at our tabl when peopl dress up to come get a steak and pay circa 50 a person such casual unprofession waitstaff total doesnt fit

value
ugh just go to the strip it bad food but even if it were good food it wouldnt be worth it
appet run about 1520 and are hard shareabl the roll new york includ four small piec the mussel are scant 
mi filet mignon was 34 im pretti sure that around what morton charges
mi soda was 4 
they have an aw meager select beer and noth on tap yet charg my husband 7 for his beer 

basic so not worth itpearl jam play wait for my food while everybodi at my tabl eat glass crash a total of 10 patron in this place are you pho real

stephani e recommend this place to tri for a dinner get togeth wour respect bfs and sinc i have frequent caff boa la bocca and ra happi hour too much late i was up for someth differ i check it out on the way home from the light rail and while it unnerv me that the space was so beauti whi would a place that special in bowl of soup be pimp out my inner bell warn me i was will to give it a shot

fast forward and i immedi notic how love and huge the space realli is the decor almost pump this place to anoth star and i truli love the lamin green tabl i thought about just take oneand i notic there was number on the tabl huh normal the staff can just have a chart for the tablewhi would they need to number it 

servic start fine they get us water no question ask we realli linger over the menu mr mustachio hasnt realli had pho beforeand when i saw a veget onli soup cost 8 my heart plummet 8 buck for pho are you shit mew order the spring roll and they were delici i consid give this a 2 star review for this reason alonebut then order for the main cours got in the way and we order our pho alreadi off to a weird start our waitress was realli spaci like i just hotbox some primo weed in the bathroom spaci i inquir re the vegetarian spring roll then the veget pho after be told the tofu would be soft and not bean curd friend and ask for the 33 beer she said we were outand my bf said oh but i just order that and she said no you order the 33 um he alreadi order anoth menu option and had state clear i will tri the vietnames beer 33 pleas wtf so we got differ beer at 4 buck each still a bit too much and wait for our order 

i think stephani was the onli one whose order was accur the first time my bf had to wait for a switch out and i had some kind of meat noodl dish i def didnt order how mani time do i have to specifi meat free within my order this was get a bit ridicul so i wait while everyon delv into their mealsthen slow down 

it just wasnt that good the fun stuff to put in pho was bare there the condiment were so so the ambianc was temper with shitti classic rock choic there was an unhappi preppi coupl seat against the wall with no window way across the place for no good reason

a i struggl to understand whi anyon realli like this place dish were drop twice dessert wasnt even entertain leftov were not box i had about 14 of my soup in fact this place made me nostalg for all other delici pho place i had been to in fact we all start talk about amaz pho place we had been to mean this wasnt it

a we walk around later burp of disgust pho kept resurfac wipe away the slate of yummi spring roll and we grumbl how we would never ever go back there

pho thang long unless you put some dragon cum in your soup to make it worth 8 buck i hope you have a go out of busi sale so i can buy your tablinstead of write a review im go to write a warn avoid this place at all cost if you want a lesson on how to run a success mexican restaur do not come here from the kid at the hostess stand to the sub par food this was truli a horribl experience

of cours you start with complimentari chip and salsa chip were room temp and not a singl grain of salt both salsa one mild chunki and anoth hot and smooth were both lack salt garlic and heat essenti tomato sauc with some red pepper flake ad for good measure

w order a quesadilla with green chile 600 and what they call a hal sampler for two 1595 which is a sampl of all their hous special pollo fundido mini chimi flauta tostada and a green corn tamal serv with rice and bean sound promis and a no brainer

a soon as the quesadilla arriv we knew what we were in for the green chile were of the can varieti and from the first bite of the old varieti while the chees was melt the quesadilla was just abov room temp and the tortilla was more dri out then actual crisp on a flat top grill each bite be wors then the last as the bare melt chees coagul around the wet mushi dice chile no amount of salsa could save this one it was doa

then the sampler arriv if there were ani high hope of melti chees and tast of thick guacamol they were squash just as soon as the plate arriv the plate of beig had chees but were barley melt and like the quesadilla everyth was just abov room temperatur let me tell you there was noth redeem or delici on this plate just a sampler of dri out deep fri food cover in chees and some hyper green bland version of guacamole

aft a few bite of this and that we ask for the check and made our way for the door when i ask our server for a to go menu she seem genuin shock that i may have thought that the food was good enough to order again i onli need it to make sure i got the inform correct when write this review the owner should be asham of themselv in a market where there is decent mexican food abound this kind of crap just doesnt fliive avoid yelp this place for a reason that reason is that it suck just as bad as their other locat in the hilton villag the food is horribl the  diner are most douch and although this locat featur less pop collar than the one in sdl i cannot figur out for the life of me whi certain peopl and blogger can claim this as some of the best pizza in the valley subpar food servic and experi in both locatbuckl up mezzo bistro  here it come  

id give you a zero rate but sinc that isnt possibl youll earn a complet undeserv one star

strik one  they have a thing call stopseat where they take a coupl of parti seat them stop the line from move for 30 minut then repeat  whi they do this when they have a bunch of empti tabl avail for seat  i have no clue

strik two  menu is veri limit and when we final order it took about 30 minut for my famili breakfast plate to arriv and  we were not serv ani bread basket when other tabl clear had  but i mean breakfast  how long doe it take to make some scrambl egg and toast  definit not 3040 minut  the toast were also burnt real bad but we didnt ask them to replac them sinc we didnt want to take the chanc of wait even longer  my side order of onion ring came out befor my main dish which i found to be weird and they were more soggi than crispi pretti bland tast as well  my dish which was a ham  chees sandwich didnt come out until about anoth 20 minut  um it a ham  chees sandwich again i dont comprehend whi it took so long  

strike three  the food was mediocr but the last straw was when we wait 1520 minut for our billreceipt  we were at the cafe for about 2 hour 90 minut of that approxim was wait time includ wait to be seat  ridicul sinc the food was mediocr and pretti pricey  im never eat here again

when the beauti carin got home though i heard myself say let go do a happi hour someplace
w decid that walk distanc was the right answer so we head out into otowsco trademark first usag on march 18 2009 pronounc ohtowskoh an alliter consist of the shorten of the phrase old town scottsdalei saw the amus discuss about the origin of dopho nopho cenpho etc and i want to be the first possibl the last and probabl the onli person to use otowsco but certainlyi want the credit
th someplac turn out to be american junki we went there a few time when it was the tequila grill and it was pretti decent then so we thought we would give this place a tri some good review on yelp but appar for the club part of the equation
a long as im make up word how about sadapoint i could also add craptacular and coupl of other but i didnt make those word up i dont like give 1 star review but these guy deserv ittruly
th troubl start right away we walk in and they didnt seem to be veri busi for a happi hour but no one greet us 2 of the owner or manag were sit right near the door when we walk but didnt so much as smile at us the server had a parti of 10 or so and 23 parti of 24 peopl but she was the onli server in the place i final ask the bartend if we could sit anywher and he grunt yes
5 minut pass and final the server come by to bring menus and take our drink order the beauti carin order hot tea and i order a dri vodka martini with a twist we also order appet sinc that what we came for
anoth 10 minut pass and she final bring out our drinkscold water in coffe cup for the tea and dirti martini gin with 3 oliv i said this is wrong and she said how do you make a dri vodka martinii could not make this up
anoth 5 minut go by and she final bring out hot water for carin and a martini glass full of relat cold vodka but no twist when i ask about the lemon twist she say she will go right back and get it
th food arriv and about 5 minut later so doe the twistthey took a lemon wedg and tri to scrape out the pulp and just give me the rind
i thought the rep on this place was that it was a drink spot that just happen to serv decent food
how the frak i use to use anoth word but in this postbattlestar galactica world it seem that frak is more social acceptablewhatev can they screw thing up this bad how can a bartend at place like this not know how make the simplest drink it was just too funny
th food was mediocr at best and by the time the bill came and that the onli thing that get this place a star22 for 3 appet and a marti the server hand was shake becaus she was so nervous about even see us again
carin and i were almost roll on the floor laugh about how poor place was so we had an entertain even in spite of it all we actual had fun rehash the funni part as we stroll home through mean street of otowsco you read it here first
i dont think we will go back to american junki anytim soonloud obnoxi music  obscen wait to get in  an even more obscen wait to get a drink  ridicul patron  the feel of either be a sardin or herd cattl take your pick  

i can say that i will not choos to come here again  i will have to be drag kick and scream like a 4 year old child who didnt get the toy they want whilst patron my target store  skip it

oh  the one star is for the drunk skanki women that end up danc on the bar  i am noth if not a weak manat least american junki is honest by includ the word junki in their titl they let you know up front that they are a manifest of the word also spell as junki this adject can be defin as  have the qualiti or be like junk cheap or of low qualiti  and it perfect describ everyth about this place

th laughabl long line of peopl wait to get in on a frisat night junky

th bouncer unbeliev junky

th patron you meet onc you final get insid the bar junky

th food junky

th too crowd bar area junky

th wait to get one measli drink junky

th servic junky

th wait staff that is more concern about their look than their tabl junky

th danc floor fill with dbag and wannab junky

unfortun ive been here more than onc not voluntarili as onc was more than enough and i alway have a junki time i dont like to wast my time do junki thing as scottsdal has so much more to offer and i also dont like buy junki thing basic it come down to the fact that i refus to spend my hard earn dollar at a place that continu promot a junki atmospher and junki custom servicmayb it my fault for not do my research befor choos a place to spend new year but my experi last night has guarante that american junki will not get ani more of my busi 

like almost everyon els who show up earli i assum their flyer advertis free cover befor 11 and a free champagn toast at midnight was legitim what i found instead was that the manag lie they even admit it to our face and guy were now 20 to get in girl would be 10 after 10

half our group main the girl had alreadi gone insid when we discov that the guy we were with had to go hunt down atm come back to a line that was poorlymanag and about 2 hour long 

am i stupid for plan around a nye flyer mayb im new to scottsdal and appar not savvi enough to realiz that some club in old town will just flat out lie to their patron they know theyll get hord of rude douchebag knock down their door to come insid anyway whi whi was i even there and whi did i give them my busi never again

oh and the insid was pack like sardin they let in so mani peopl that fight were break out left and right get a drink was hopeless and bathroom line were a half hour long peopl were hop the fenc to get in sick and tire of the line outsid but those in our parti who had to wait so long to get in were disappoint anyway

w stay till midnight think just mayb the bar would keep one promis theyd advertis all over their websit and pass out flute of champagn nope

thi would have never happen in downtown phoenix i know it just a bar but honest peopl we need to hold place account for decept my friend and i plan a night out that got ruin and half our parti left fed up with the situation

dont go to american junki it is just that junkwtf happen to chili i use to frequent the one on mill ave for lunch becaus they were fast and the food was usual pretti decent dont get me wrong im not talk gourmet or healthi but it at least tast decent 

we went to this locat for dinner the other night and it was absolut horribl the servic was incred slow we order and it took over an hour  and a game of chase with our waitress to final get our food we complain to her about the wait and she offer no apolog when we final did get our food it was cold not luke warm but cold in addit to that the famous southwestern eggrol were a soggi mess i rare complain to a manag but this situat warrant a big complaint 

the manag was nice and gave us 20 off the bill and a free gross dessert to go we end up pitch it in the trash it was complet ined chili you have offici made the blacklistwow what a horribl experience
i have been eat at this chili for about 20 year now ive alway had a good to pretti good experi but this time it was just horrifi 

the food came out tast aw we are done give chili a chanc we will not be backseem to be a recur theme that the ownermanag of this particular branch is rude to custom  the one star is for her attitud  mayb she should read yelp and get her act together

i love nbc but the onli one i have use is the one in tukee

id advis that one if you want good polit service

th chocol chocol chip cake is awesom  

and the red velvet is abov decent also

pric are high but worth it in taste

th food is 45 star for sureas a famili we love the cake here but bad busi practic has us refus to patron them ani more

mi mother in law had a coupon to use and order a cake  when she pick up the cake she was told that she couldnt use the coupon it was onli for decor cake  so she held onto it

a friend birthday came along and she thought it was the perfect opportun to use the coupon  she could get a decor cake for her friend  so she order a decor cake

and was told again that she could not use the coupon  no real reason whi just that she couldnt  twice she spent good money at the locat and neither time would they honor the coupon  

and there was no attempt to make her happi  i mean it was a simpl coupon  it basic cover the cost the decor  whi not just give her the discount and keep the custom  and the associ told her that it had happen to other peopl who were probabl also unhappi then whi hasnt anyth been done to rectifi the situation

disingenu busi practic lead to loss of customwent here for new year eve  while the even went well toward the end the bartend were more slosh than then partier and observ take multipl shot and refus to serv us water unless we paid 13 or flash our ladi part such a deal video camera not option 

i could write more but frank there are hundr of place to have a drink downtown and this place should be your last last last last last last choici was at the same parti as carolyn and jen e  heyyy ladi  and yes it was terribl  the ownersbartendersmanag three in one  tripe threat alert lack ani discret act obnoxi rude and were total douch  and this was on top of not honor our agreement on drink et al

at one point they kick out my friend for call obm a dckhole which is inde insult and slight out of line except for the fact that they were in fact be huge dckhole  upon kick him out they near refus to let him get his jacket in the 15 degre weather  and get this said he was welcom back ani time  what  pleas obm of the tiki bar  take your med befor come to work becaus you are serious wack out

ther are so mani wonder place in madison to have a drink  skip this one  unless you like show your hooha for water at the end of the night

i hope it goe out of busi with all it shadi practic and ludicr douchebaggerithis restaur look realli cool from the outsid  i guess i got suck in by all the beauti fish in the fish tank  i also thought how bad can noodl be from beijin  whua shocker  it was bad

they said they the noodl were handpul  i know how handpul noodl should tast  these were not even close  the textur were too soft and didnt have the q al dant they should have  the pork and mushroom sauc were so littl i had to add soy sauc to the noodl in order to eat it  

the order of  beef pancak has 2 and were the size of dollar coin  

conclus  veri small portion veri expens and veri bad food  dont be entic by the fish tank like i did  walk far far away from this place  it not even worthi of 1 starim a jack vegan well that not fair most day i do it right 

so everybodi seem to think id love this place like i should for some reason like it 

i hate it so much so so much 

there noth wrong with it unless you want your food to tast good but if your one of those moron who are into that there a littl problem with pita jungl same with schlotzki everyon seem to like it i have never had anyth there that tast good but mani wonder peopl feel differ i cant explain it but thank god for divers in the univershow do i write this review without come across like an utter bitch i guess there is no simpl way out of me acquir queen bitch for this one

i got there befor the rest of the parti as i want to do a bit of explor around the citi whilst they primp themselv in the hotel

bounc at the door american with a clipboard and an earpiec all i could think was
wher the hell did the girl book and how much will this cost me
it was like a veri shini mtv music video facad facad be the oper word i was escort to the cocktail bar whilst i wait for my parti i start read the big issu at the bar which i know was like if a nun streak in a chanel shop but hey i have nake nun moments

cocktail was good servic was great they push a doubl vodka on me after which was a bit meh dont like peopl tri to use me for money in an obvious way

so dinner we were put at a huge marbl tabl interior is impress in a homag to all thing dragqueen like kinda way good thing i heart dragqueen music is a disast too loud and chart like on loop 

dinner consist of us stare at each other oh but it get better never in all my year dine have i been in a place that think it ok not to section of the dine area from the bar area drunken men hover over at our tabl and stare at us eat i felt like a cow at the mart wait to be bought

i got the swordfish i ask for it to be medium rare it was well done as one of the parti comment the food come out far too fast it all was a tad too new money pretenti to me

th absolut best part was when the sick sweet waiter overcharg us by 60 pound and didnt apologis or offer us drink i realli want to kick him hard in the ball for tri to take advantage

i was told later that night that that place is a chain ill look for somewher authent and local next time im theretgif suck so whi did we come here becaus they had a realli good breakfast deal for 399  we had a group of 10 guy all worn out from a bachelor parti five of us got there first we were quick seat the next 5 show up soon after and sat down 

we sat there for over 5 minut and no server the place was dead and there was hard ani custom worker were run about not one came to serv us my bud ask a ladi for servic with an attitud she said shell send someon we waitno one come 

we get up and leav i guess the tgif in lv is the same in la horribl go to ping pang pong instead for some decent chines foodso i typic check into a place and mayb leav a quick tip  my experi tonight has inspir me to final write a review  this is not a good thing  for me to take the time to write a full review take some serious impress upon me from the restaur  in this case the impress was so piss poor i couldnt help but come home and sit down direct to cyberlambast our even activ  this buffalo wild wing has been close for over a year and i honest think they should either a hire a compet staff with a great manag or b close their door again becaus they clear have no idea what they are do as a team  

to begin we are a parti of 6 well 5 12 sinc the babi doesnt count as fulli human yet  we were told that a booth that seat 6 would open up momentarili and would we mind a brief wait  no sweat  i like sit on my husband lap but not at dinner in a restaur  after sit for a few we were told to follow the host  he sat us down at a small booth that liter squish me up against my husband and the babi car seat  when i question is this the booth for 6  it aw small the host said no this seat 4 but you could wait if you want for the larg booth  i thought we had made that choic alreadi but i suppos ignor your custom prefer is ok the host said he could bring a car seat sling sinc we were squash  have 3 older hungri children i acquiesc to his offer

our server appear prompt and she was veri upbeat  ok thing were get better  she took our drink order and gave individu attent to the children which was great  my husband order a beer we all order soda  she return with the soda and said the beer was on the way  she took our appet order and the meal order  she ask if we would like the appet befor the entre and we said yes the beer still hadnt arriv  when she check in a few min later the beer still hadnt found it way to the tabl  she person grab it from the bar  as my husband took the first sip he note that the beer was skunk  bad flavor sat out and got warm and then was rechil  he mention this to the server and she state oh yea we have some issu with beer at the bar get bad  happen a lot  really

so at this point the entre come to the tabl  where is the appet  no one know  also the carrotceleri order magic chang into 4 order of celeri  the server say she will check with the kitchen about the status of the appet and grab some carrot as well  we just start eat our food becaus we were hungry

now the food was good  i cant complain about the wing at all  the kid like their kid meal  the portion were good  this was the onli save grace of the evening

th server come back with carrot and say the appet is come  we keep eat and notic there are no extra napkin  with chicken wing you sorta need napkinsw are messi  we are messi our finger and face are messi  it hard to feed a squirmi 9 month old and tri not to get the hot sauc on our finger mix with the not hot food shes eat  

the appet still is mia

at this point all the kid are done eat  i am full  i am request a box  my husband is done eat  he ask for a nonskunk beer  the beer come and the appet is still not there  the server say do you want the kitchen to just box up the appet  the nice ladi i am say outloud yea i guess so  the furious bh insid me say silent you can tell the kitchen to shove the appet up their a  so we get an appet in a box well after the entre to go home with  we order a sampler platter onion ring mozzarella stick nacho and some wing none of which is too tasti after get cold and spend a night in a fridg  

we pay our full billnot even a sorri was offer  i honest didnt even feel like pay the 12 for the platter but i was just too disappoint to say anyth  we rare go out to eat sinc we are a larg famili  spend 100 for dinner just isnt alway in our budget  i didnt want to mar the even for the kid by complain  they thought everyth was terrif so i let them maintain that belief  

when i got home i open the sampler platter just to see what was in thereth three sauc were in the box with no lid and the sauc had manag to spill on everyth and mix togeth  i now have a bunch of snack swim in a melang of ranch chees sauc and marinaranot my idea of a flavor explos  

we dont eat out often and it experi like these that keep me from want to go dine out  i know it a chain and not chez robertfancyp but i expect my appet at the tabl befor the meal and most certain not in a box after the meal has been eaten  sorri wild wingsw gave you a shot but i dont think i want to drop 100 again  everi thought i had figur out how to have a good meal at la brioch take out  i veri much enjoy the organ burger and some of the omelet and with take out i had been abl to avoid the horribl service

ala no more  

i call in an order for my usual burger with avocado and swiss state i would be right over  i arriv paid for it and wait  and wait  i check onli to find that the person who took my call had indic that i would pick it up one hour later than i had said  no apolog from the staff involv bare an apolog from anoth staff member and certain no gestur like pleas have a pastri on us

i am done with true food  madison has a number of other restaur with better food and much much better service

incident while wait for my miss order i discov how to get good servic at true food have a relationship with a staff member  a young women who was appar attach in some fashion girlfriend to a staff member receiv lavish attent from that person and other staff

so unless you are relat to someon who work at true food look elsewherhere we go again so mani peopl told me how good this place was i dont know what they are eat or what they are compar it to it is horribl jay p who say he is from dc nail the descript of the omelett perfect the servic is abysm which realli hurt a restaur such as this when you cant fall back on the food to be good and your servic fail you you have noth left the name impli french one bite of a croissant tell you it should be call la pillsburi the coffe is good but it is no secret it kickapoo which is a pretti good coffee

th bland food the horribl croissant the uninterest and date select of menu choic doe noth to bring me back and it wontahh sun citi popul who caresth place you live to die  this food is for the die soul  so if your readi to goitadakimasu japanes for bon appetitveri disappoint if i had review this befor im sure they would of gotten 5 star but after tonight visit they deserv onli 1 for overal servic i use to be quit a regular here so much that the waitress alreadi knew what i was go to order and she welcom me with a glass of lilikoi as i walk thru the door 

today visit was quit the contrari as i walk thru the door the older ladi turn her back to us but i simpli went straight to an open tabl a few minut pass as we wait and anoth coupl walk in thru the door the older ladi was deliv food to a tabl and she stood there to have a 6 minut convers with the tabl i was look at my watch not give ani aloha that we were go on almost a 15 minut wait and that there was custom stand at the entranc 

after the long convers the older ladi decid to sit down the coupl and hand them some menus my mom had to get up and ask the older ladi for some menus after she sat back down the phone rang and she total forgot about us the younger waitress that alway there came out from the back and i calm ask her for menus for a second time  let me just state that there was onli two other tabl that were alreadi eat the place was not pack for such lack of custom servic  still no menus came the older ladi walk to the back twice more and brought the tabl next to us a to go box and even decid to take the coupl order that had walk in after us

on our way out some employe was be disciplin on the back step presum about to quit
iv never been so glad to quit a place as thisreflect back on my visit here a few month ago with a unbias neutral mind my experi here was been the worst of my life 

went in on a friday night with a group of 5 after see an advertis special of 1499 all you can eat sushi 

when we got there it was fair empti but we werent seat for about 15 minut for no given reason at all after be seat we sat for anoth 10 minut after our waitress disappear without ani notic or even leav of ani menus at all when she came back to fianlli take our drink order she told us that the tini piec of paper in the plastic display was the menu it was then we foud out that the special 1499 menu was limit to about 67 differ item from the veri basic nigiri salmon tuna shrimp to a few plain unorigin roll california phill spici tuna no appet no includ drink just those dissatisfi and irrit alreadi i ask to see a regular menu becuas i wasnt feeel for ani of those she snarl and said no ayc on the full menu you have to pay full price i didnt ask for the price i ask for the menu her farfetch assumpt that we were cheap was veri insult we shouldv left then but we didnt
 
there was a select of happi hour cocktail and mix drink that we order some of which never arriv at all some chose to order off the regular menu some chose the ayc and one so turn off by the way thing were go simpli didnt want to eat anyth 

the food came out extrem slowli for the ayc often all on one big plate left for us to divid them across the tabl in confus the sushi was veri veri mediocr need i say ive had some better prepackag supermarket brand nigiri had too much rice sushi rice be too cold and lack vinegar and the fish be hard fresh the roll were not bad nor great just bore 

dure the entir time our parti was dine we didnt reciev one polit gestur from the waitress or even the bussers

th tip point of the whole night was at the end after ask for the bill which was a difficult task simpli becaus we could bare get a hold of our server she deliv it and vanish onc more ahh the problem aros we were grossli overcharg she charg us for 6 ayc and all the cocktail we order were full price when we ask her about it she claim that the nonayc patron ate fron the ayc plate that was not the case trust me i hard doubt they were die to sneak a bite of a california roll she insist that was the case and even start to argu also when ask about the drink she said that we order them after the happi hour time when in realiti the fact that we got our drink 30 minut after we order them due to the entir staff neglig was probabl whi she thought we order them late also and the kicker there was a crazi 5 servic charg ad to everi singl ayc dinner patron which brought the actual price of it to 1999 per person never in my life had i heard of hidden fee at a restaraunt car and home i understand dinner are you kid me
our entir parti furious we spoke with the manag explain the entir situat and the most he did was take off all the mistak even still that was onli done becaus of us claim we wouldnt pay if it was correct 

to further rate this place ill do it on a rubric base out of 100 point 

food speed 30100
food qualiti 50100
servic 0100
decor 65100
price 40100

avoid avoid avoid servic here is what kill it and i know it wasnt just a bad day or just that particular waitress becaus i work at the starbuck in the same plaza ad see them regular most of the staff is extrem rude and snobbithe husband and i came here after work becaus i was starv  upon walk in i was realli excit and i felt like this was go to be a 5 star place  the decor was simpl and clean and it kind of remind me of my hous  then it becam a 4 star place when our order came to 23 dollar  a littl pricey for me  i order a bacon cheeseburg that tout applewood smokey bacon along with a side of tater tot  yum

our food arriv and well i subtract anoth star becaus it was sloppi look and frank a tad unappet  my tot were pretti dark but i happen to like mine overcook so they are realli crispi  other peopl may be veri disappoint with this  the burger was veri larg but the patti was veri commerci  my bacon was the biggest disappoint  it was transluc  i expect nice thick cut bacon when order an expens burger  the tast was no better than appear  it was incred greas laden so much so that it made the bun soggi  addit i am 994 sure that everyth they use come from costco  the patti were definit the same one that come in a big stack with sheet of paper between them  the bacon was definit the kind that come in the big giant reseabl kirkland bag  yike  not good  were down to two stars

aft i didnt finish eat my burger i felt pretti gross  it took a few minut to sink in but i realiz i just put an immens amount of greas into my tummi  i am not one to shi away from greasi diner breakfast and the like but holi crap this was a new level  i didnt feel well  an hour later i am definit sick  now we are down to one star  i have a wick stomach ach as i write this review  ugh  i want to vomit so i can just get this crap out and pretend it never happen  what a disappointwe were not greet when we walk in the door  the ladi run the counter gave us a sur look and went back to restock the counter item  then after she chang the small garbag bucket while wring garbag juic off her hand she ask what we wanted

w just stop in for a snack and i had want to tri their food so we order the slider to share along with some sweet potato fri and a tea  no thank you or smile or anyth we were obvious just in her way

our slider arriv with sweet potato fri that were obvious sit out for the day  cold lifeless and disgust  i went back insid and ask for a fresh batch and got dirti look from everyon  

while wait for the fresh fri we ate the slider which were pretti good  the burger bun onion and chees were tasti someth id be happi have again  but not with servic like this and i also notic that mid afternoon while the staff stood behind the grill eat 2 peopl observ eat while work one was garbag juic hand girl the main garbag remain overflow with disgust refus spatter on the white garbag stand  ick

whil the slider were fine and the fresh fri were pretti decent the servic attitud peopl eat dure their shift and lack of clean up were not someth id like to plan my meal around  i predict an upcom health code violat  no gold or silver star in their futurhair in my sushi

so disgust and my bf and i didnt even finish our ayc we still had so much food on the tabl but we were so disgust in addit to that i got bake green mussel and there was shell crack in the mussel none of the shell were even broken so i dont even know where they came from but it definit hurt my teeth when i ate them

i use to go here all the time but not ani more even though the server recogn me they still didnt discount my meal 45 for two lunch ayc more like 25 roll that we were abl to order and they couldnt even comp my drink i paid it though  0 tip

dont go here believ me i like support small restaur and not corpor chain but this place doe not deserv your patronagthe food was realli good actual it might have been better if they got the order right and it hadnt arriv cold so here are the cons

 it took 2 hour for them to deliv the food
 they couldnt deliv to my hotel room becaus they were too lazi to park their car and walk it up
 they forgot to give me the complimentari 2 liter drink they promis online
 the pizza arriv cold
 the caesar salad was sent to me with italian dress for some reason
 the caesar salad use iceberg lettuc even though the menu say romaine
 they forgot to give me the garlic bread they say come with the salad
 after i call to complain the guy on the phone told me he would send me the thing i am miss caesar dress garlic bread soda it been 5 hours

in conclus if you are look for deliveri go somewher els they failso the respons i receiv from scott g of rhythm kitchen is
hi shawn
unfortun it our polici to onli accept one offer  at a time it post with our 12 off wine that it can not be combin with ani other offerd in addit your live social deal also state can not be combin with ani other offerd 
we do rememb when you were here  and you had a groupon you tri to use in addit to the live social and 12 wine special 
we apolog for ani confus you my have experienc  howev if you use grouponsliv social deal often it standard that the deal can not be combin with ani other offer

hop this helps

th funni thing about this respons is that i didnt have a groupon that i was tri to use and yes peopl i understand now that their polici doesnt allow the use of two or more offer  howev when one is told in the begin of their dinner by someon that is repres such polici that you could get 12 price bottl of wine after they knew of live social combo that with it be my first time there and trust the server to guid me  i would have not order the wine if i were not told that i could get it 12 price  the ladi that came to the tabl even said the server was wrong and he will never make that mistak again  great so fix it maam and stop say it my fault  as i said to scott g to his respons if i ever receiv a respons it would be the calib it is  lame  

also i didnt experi ani confus just embarrass for me and my guest with be told the polic were go to be call and be rude spoken to by that ladi manag  

again if you are consid dine here i high suggest you reconsidsore disappoint is the best way to sum up my even i went for restaur week with a date and we both regret make region bistro our choic to start off they are clear on the restaur week websit but although the event end sunday they said they had alreadi end it to their credit the manag on duti did allow us to choos an app main cours and desert and give it to us at the special price this onli allow us to experi more of the terribl for app we had the crab cake and the gazpacho i clear rememb say the shrimp gazpacho but our waiter must have misheard us the soup was aw the crab cake uninspir the main cours we chose turkey dinner and prime rib the mash potato tast like they came from a bag the veget also tast like they came frozen in a bag the worst might have been the stuf omg what are they think this is probabl the absolut worst stuf i have ever tast in my entir life the onli deceit thing was the banana foster but it was too littl too late to save this disast oh did i not mention the sever lack wine select oh yes it was sad like a puppi with three leg for over a 100 tab for two peopl i must reiter i am sore disappointi have been put off write this review becaus i was tri to recal someth posit about the experi  here is what i came up with
posit  beer and wine is includ in the price and it isnt horrible
                  desert are great some of the better gelato i have had outsid of italy
                  a lot of choices
                  the chef was veri friend and eager to assist at the carv station

th rest of the review  ok this was a horribl experi from the start  when we arriv we were sixth in line on a mid week night  it took us over 45 minut to get to the cashier and anoth 30 minut to get seat  the cashier was extrem rude and look at me like i was crazi ask if they had a child discount  they do but onli for 8 and under which seem kind of redicul but i high recommend you go elsewher with kid 918

so we were final seat order our drink and went to look around  although item appear to be group togeth by region of origin there is no signag and the layout requir you to go around the carv station to get anywher  

mi first impress of the food was that it look good  i was a bit put off that the cleanli of the buffet area was so bad  the setup often requir you to ladl across sever item of food result in food on the counter and food mix in with other food  at most buffet there are staff member prompt clean up the spillag but here i did not see that occur at all in fact between my first trip to the buffet and my second some of the spill were still there

specif issu  the pita was hard as a rock the roll were stale the meat overcook everyth appear to have excess greas  the orient food was utter flavorless although the pad thai was servic if less than a 1 in spice level

when we got back to our tabl there were tini fli creatur around i had to kill at least two  i bare ate ani of the item on the first plate and went back for a second trip onli becaus i had paid 2500 and want to at least find someth edibl  i got mac and chees and fruit on the second trip   the fruit was fresh but not quit ripe on the melon and poor cut as there was rind on sever piec  the mac and chees was actual good  veri cheesey and with cheddar flavor chees sauc instead of the usual american

th place wasnt veri busi but we didnt see our server to refil our drink until we were almost done with the food  my daughter who usual love buffet onli took sushi which she said wasnt veri good and spaghetti and watermelon  normal she make a second trip but she was complain her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didnt even eat a desert we did get one to take with us which she ate 12 of in the car

und our tabl was food from the previous custom i know becaus neither i or my daughter had the spring rolls

al in all it was a huge disappoint  i think the major of peopl who rate this place high do so becaus of the free alcohol

i will not be back herefine becaus im tire of this place have such a high rate from fake review im go to review my attempt to eat there

w went by last week walk over there and the owner was outsid  he told us that they had a soft open the night befor and that they would be open monday at 4pm for dinner  ok pop well be back at 4 on monday

so monday roll around and we are starv by the time we get home from work at 4  we walk over and there are two chef stand around in the doorway chat it up while smoke  we walk up and are likewtf  and the guy tell me that the owner is out buy ingredi and that they might open at 5  so i ask to see a menu and he say we dont have menus  
excus me
w type them up the day of
wel that seem horribl ineffici and like a wast of paper  so how am i suppos to know what you have to eat and if i want to come here

yathat what i thought  so even though your horribl tacki sign with a car on it that conveni doesnt say your name say youll be open at 4 your not open  and even though you guy are the cook you dont know what on the menu for the night  that sound like a recip for disast  

im on a budget so im not just go to walk into your place and eat  i want to see a menu befor i walk in  get your act and your websit togeth and mayb i will be back  until then i will just walk by and grab a sub at calabriai also hate give a bad review to anyth downtown becaus it such an under and underus communiti that develop around my hood and i want everi new busi to succeed  howev i feel the disappoint still within me a day after my so call celebr chef meal  this is in the top 5 worst meal ive ever paid for  
to start the hummus was serv with store bought lavash and it wasnt finish by 3 peopl and that was not becaus of the size or lack of hunger and all three of us love hummus  the albacor on skewer was overcook dri and serv w a homemad aoli that to me tast like helman with a bit of red pepper  if the major of the ingredi in a sauc are premad it not homemad  that like buy ceaser salad dress at the store and ad some parmesan to it and call it your homemad dress  weak  last the sirloin with chimichurri sauc was also overcook to about medium well and flavorless other than a seem similar made chimichurri sauc  
this place is just half ass in general  i put quit a bit more effort and thought into make a sack lunch  man this is my first review on yelp and i feel like an asshol cuz it scath but i was that disapoint with this place that is tri to be someth it is absolut not  
on a final note our server was extrem friend and attent though the celebr chef had not educ her on much more than mayb 2 item on the menu  i hope that somehow someway they can turn this place around but as of now the onli thing worth go for is the free crappi sangriaif you want to recreat this muchrev phoenician favorit at home here is a veri simpl recipe

 1 dont buy fish
 
 2 find stale old breadcrumb in your cupboard  form crumb into a flat oblong shape and insert into recycl oil from the last batch of fri you made perhap last year
 
 3 slowli bring oil to a boil cook until a soggi golden brown

 4 remov from oil and place onto an entir roll of brawny®

 5 open foodservic grade can of tartar slop dunk fri oblong into slop bite chew cri repeat

if your a real seafood aficionado throw some crusti horseradish into generic ketchup and dunk in there

 yet to find even a scrap of fish in an order of pete fish n chip the name is a liethe mind boggl i dont even know what to say about this place where to start 


ive live in phoenix for 6 year pass by pete a gazillion time but i never stop becaus they onli take cash and i never seem to have cash on me final one fate day i decid to pull in and see what all the fuss was about i was hope for some decent fish and chip what i got was someth els 

i understand that this place is import for nostalgia sake peopl tie memori to food and this place is a part of phoenix cultur i get that peopl have gone to pete with their parent and grandpar  at one time this is what pass for good food this hurt my heart

let just lay it all on the tabl here pete fish is pretti darn aw the shrimp if you can call it shrimp is most bread about 2 ounc of bread with a quarter ounc of shrimp somewher in there i felt the need to dissect one just to see how much shrimp was actual present 

the fish is in patti form  2012 and the fish is a patti it a rectangl it the filetofish minus the chees and bread there is no rectangular fish in the ocean what the heck is go on here

i mean i cant even put togeth a decent well written review here becaus my mind cannot wrap itself around the fact that peopl love this place it so bad 


the sauc is i mean realli it ketchup and tabasco sauc  

word is pete has good burger and i love a cheap burger  so i will tri at least onc more but i wont be go for the seafoodwe just got thrown out of archi deli in surpris az what was our horrif crime order an offthemenu appet one that my husband has order there and receiv at least five time 

today the manag refus to do it say we would put him out of busi if he let everyon order togo food and eat it in the restaur everyon who it was midafternoon and the place was empti we told him we would happili pay for the forbidden item half a pound of hot tongu with a slice of challah as we alway did but he blew up and told us to get out

w are cleancut polit adult custom who typic spend 60 everi time we go to archi we tip well love the food have a good rapport with the staff and never caus a problem there this was probabl our tenth visit to archi and that manag has seen us befor 

thank to his nasti attitud today we wont be back and that a shame archi has a nice select of sandwich great latk and a wonder select of classic deli beverag the sandwich are big enough to share but we alway buy two and take leftov home 

it unfortun that this manag didnt have the smart to sell my husband his tongu and breadeven at a markup now he lost our busi 60 everi other week add up archi in this economi isnt custom retent important

think long and hard befor you spend your hard earn money and time here we wont make that mistak againi think the onli thing i can say i am guilti to like is their empanada and chees sauc but how to you eff up fri dough stuf with meat and some melt cheese

i came becaus im hella bore with the food around the hous that i frequent and we havent step into a on the border for a while 

big mistak 

look now i cant quit possibl prove that my cousin did not give me a stomach flu the night befor with his bbq but no one els is sick  yes i wasnt feel great befor eat but it was most relat to be hungri i was in pain a few hour after and was throw up and ride the porcelain bus so frequent that i wish i had a pad toilet seat it day two and i havent eaten and im just sip on pediatr electrolyteslowli becaus drink too much caus sever pain

i thought i would write to you today to let you know that i have been a loyal custom of your restaur chain for mani year when i travel on busi and get to my hotel i usual look to see if one of your on the border restaur is in the area and at least onc a week i will wind up have dinner there or just hang out in the cantina for a while most often on busi trip i visit your outlet in kennesaw georgia where my compani is located

when i move from connecticut to north las vega in the fall of 2011 i was pleasant surpris to find one of your restaur not far away in centenni 5630 centenni center blvd las vega nv 89149 i actual found out about this particular on the border becaus i receiv an email from your corpor offic regard a free lunch for veteran day or memori day 2012 i cant recal exact which one

and this is where my problem with your organ began and whi i will no longer visit your restaurants

1 i went to the centenni locat for the advertis veteran special i sat down and ask for the veteran day menu and i was summarili told that this particular establish doe not follow corpor advertis and market campaign i was not pleas howev i still ate there that day


2 the week of august 4th 2013 i took my son to your restaur my son is 3 month shi of his 21st birthday and he is an activ duti unit state marin at the time on leav from okinawa japan while here in the las vega area my son has never had an issu sit in a restaur cantina or bar as long as he is not consum alcohol beverag on this particular occas we were go to order lunch while sit in a booth along the window as far away from the bar as possibl it was not long befor we were summarili kick out of the cantina into the regular seat area i was inform that sinc he is not 21 he couldnt be in the cantina well it was annoy but if that your corpor polici i figur we would get over it

3 at least twice a month my wife and i visit this locat for taco tuesday the day befor my son return to his okinawa unit august 13 2013 we return to your centenni locat for 125 taco tuesday i walk in the restaur and mention to the manag about what happen the week befor that we could not sit in the cantina but we want taco tuesday he told us he could not serv us taco tuesday special in the main restaur and that sinc my son was not 21 and could not go in the cantina he could not take advantag of the tuesday special he wasnt veri pleasant about it either

aft i gave your manag a piec of my mind my son and i did an about face and ate at one of your competitor locat down the street in their cantina no less

a state abov i will no longer visit ani of your locat local or otherwise

sincerfor a 14 buffet that too in vega you would expect some qualiti the breakfast buffet at the imperi palac provid none of that avoid this and the lunch buffet as well at all cost serious i dont have write anymor for this review it just a wast time for you and for me just avoid this place at all cost it just that terribl whi isnt there an option for 0 star it final deserv one of the previous review is absolut right about burger king be delici compar this and that the most barfabl fast food joint of alltim ive never miss 14 so much in my lifewow read the other review here i cant understand how i had such a horribl experi at tuvalu it almost make me want to give them anoth shot almost becaus the place was so obvious mismanag result is such abysm valu and custom servic that i cant imagin ever leav anoth dollar there 

we were realli expect a decent lunch after read review check out the menu onlin and walk in to see such a nice welcom space it was about 130 on a beauti sunday afternoon it seem like everyth was in our favor right until we start order the first thing i tri to order they couldnt make becaus theyd run out of tabouleh okay place run out of thing no sweat while i was redecid i heard the clerk tell anoth custom they were out of tuna i settl on the tuvalu salad at which point the clerk yell over her shoulder hey do we have enough green to make a salad after consid a head of leaf lettuc in a groceri store bag they decid that yes they could make me a salad  we also order ice tea which they were out of and told us it would be 10 minut for them to make more we decid that would be fine we felt bad for them 

so we took our seat at a tabl perus the gift shop area which seem to have nice thing and wait and wait and wait there seem to be an insan amount of activ go on in the kitchen area consid that there were about 5 peopl in the whole place and zero food come out eventu our drink came about 15 minut after that we final got our sandwich and salad which were quit frank pathet first i could have prepar these thing in about 90 second in my home kitchen the salad wasnt even toss it was for 8 a small plate of green leaf lettuc not what i think of when i read organ green on a menu 4 giant unpeel cucumb slice a few slice of feta and a pile of sunflow seed and dri cranberri on the side was a plastic cup of some kind of creami dress from a bottl that was certain not the advertis balsam vinegarett my husband sandwich was basic as advertis besid miss the tomato that was suppos to be on it mayb they were out of tomato too and didnt feel like admit that they just werent prepar to make food that day it came with a pile of lettuc similar to mine with the same silli dress we grim ate and got out of there as fast as we could what a wast 

whoever run this place clear has no idea what theyr do they were out of everyth and it took so long to prepar our food that there cant have been ani prep work done ahead of time i hate to see  small busi fail but i just cant see clear to tell anyon to spend money here 25 for essenti a side salad a grill chees sandwich and 2 ice tea ughaw yogurt how the hell can you screw up the flavor chocol well mojo yogurt can and they have i want to puke after i took a few spoon in the hope that the next spoon would be better somehow becaus it look like chocol and it said it was chocol so it must be chocolatebut no it was just gross oh and the 8 price for it was the last strawthe last time i gave this place a tri the food suck and i gave it 2 star  on a recent vega trip my flight was at a gate nearbi and i decid to give them anoth chanc  

this time around the food still suck but the employe are even wors  here what happenedi order the follow items

bean rice chees burrito 699
bottl of diet pepsi 319

sinc i had a backpack and other stuff in my hand i forgot the bottl of diet pepsi at the counter after i paid for the meal  i went to the counter to get settl in a spot to eat and get napkin utensil etc  5 minut later they call my number for my burritoi was starv so i start to eat it  after a few bite i notic that i didnt have my sodawher was it  i look around went back to the counterth employe look at me but didnt say anyth  i walk around again look for itthen i said to the girl cashier i think i left my soda somewher have you seen it  she said no then look at one of the guy and said someth in spanish to him  he said oh i think i have it  i found it on the counter  i watch as he reach into his backpack and gave it back to mewtf  i think they do this all the time watch for peopl to leav stuff behind and then take it  the appal thing is that i was still in the restaur  

i didnt say anyth to themit wouldv done no good anyway  onc a thief alway a thief

that doe it for me i will never eat here again

return factor  0hand down one of the worst sushi experi ive had in phoenix 

let me first start by say that i am a moder adventur sushi eater so my palett extend far beyond the californiarol crowd

i know it the holiday but at 1130 for lunch you could hear the cricket  the staff were lacklust and it seem that onli the sunlight come from the window was necessari to light the place it had an almost close feel  

we order the spici tuna roll and two signaturerol  the spici tuna was quit hot perhap to mask the fishi tast of their product  the aoki roll was virtual ined the snow crab so fishi it seem to liter be die on the plate  the geisha was for me the onli roll fair enjoy  we had two box of left over which liter becam a doggi bag as i serv them to harley and cleo when i return home

tim and again i am disappoint with phoenix sushi place find them most pretenti and over ratedsav one  hana  for my money this is hand down the freshest sushi and the liveliest staff in town  consist great  if you havent tri the sushi carpaccio you are in for someth special

i realli want to like moira as i am a cenpho junki  i wont return though and liter shudder when i think of that crab  blehthe menu onli exist in order to know what the restaur doesnt have  i understand it onli been open a littl over a month but run out of just about everyth mean they are veri poor manag and have a veri poor busi model

i was here twice in april new england month  unfortun for them i live in boston for 5 year  let hope they dont tri to do new england ever again in the futur  the chowder was terribl  the ri style calamari was a joke  there were liter 5 piec of squid on the plate and no lemon  after those i was too scare to order ani of the other region dishes

on my first visit veri short after they had open a friend order a mai tai right off the specialti drink menu  it was serv to her and she immedi notic it was the wrong color  where the dark rum  oh we ran out of dark rum so i just put some more light rum in it  note to bartend  if someon order a drink and you dont have the right ingredi ask if they would mind a substitut  my bet is that they might order someth different

lat in the month on the second trip we tri to order the crab mac and chees  nope sorri out of crab mac and chees  so instead i order the chop salad  amaz it didnt have pine nut and the smoke salmon somehow turn into grill salmon  by this point my friend and i had basic figur out this place was a joke and didnt mind make it public and loud known  rather than attempt to fix the situat the bartend and server all start to ignor us  final the manag came over and i explain to him that what i had receiv in the chop salad wasnt anywher close to what was describ on the menu  

he liter ask me oh are you in the busi  

no i just happen to be abl to read and i just happen to know what im eat  

he explain that theyv been veri busi and therefor had run out of lot of thing  note to manag  smoke salmon pine nut crab mac and chees and dark rum are not rare exot ingredi  you run out of someth you go buy more  or you explain to custom that what they order isnt what they will get  appar he didnt like hear that there are some peopl that know the differ and he start to treat us in a veri condescend manner  im not the douchebag here buddi  clear you are the douchebag  if you dont know how to run a restaur dont becom a restaur manag  simple

oh lest i forget  we had actual order 2 chop salad after be told that they count under the 2for1 entre grand open special  when we got the check we had to have the bartend remov one of the salad as we were charg for both  almost got us region  almost got us

sinc my group was in a small rush to get to the la bocca yelp event the manag  keith kyle kevin  offer to buy us a round if we came back later  not one to ever refus free alcohol we did return later in the night after the yelp event  and we brought lot of friend  our group of 5 turn into 11 all readi and will to give region our busi  lo and behold the manag didnt comp us a round of drink even though we made it clear that whi we had return and we were wile to stay there if shown some love  all he had to do was take the 5 kamikaz shot off the bill and it might have made up for the rest of the night  guess not  well done  love the honesty

in conclus  food suck servic suck manag suck  but it benefit from a great locat so ill probabl wind up give it anoth chanc when in tempemil avei had such high hope for this place  let me start off by say that i am a breakfast person and veri particular  breakfast ingredi are cheap and there are not that mani uniqu combin so it is an absolut necess that it be done right  if you are think oh that me this is not the place for you

first the staff was friend but not over excit or veri apologet that it took 30 minut to get our food  it was also unpleas warm insid the restaur  i might be abl understand if the place had been crowd but it wasnt  it was half empti at 11 am on a saturday

th food was not especi cheap for the qualiti  i had the ham steak breakfast which was near 10 for ham egg toast and potato  here are some thought from my meal and what els was order at our tabl  the ham was tasti but it was slice ham and not a ham steak  my over easi egg were brown   the toast was cold  the pancak were fluffi but dri like a biscuit and not spongi  the home fri were tasteless and undercook unless you like hard potato  the cream for the coffe wasnt cream it was milk  the sausag patti use were the cheap one you can buy frozen at walmart and hard qualifi as meat 

i let out a sigh of relief when we step out into the open air glad to be final free from wait for someon to take payment while enjoy the cool breez rush across the back of my leg cool them as it evapor the moistur built up from an hour of sit on a cushion in an overwarm room  the joy of this moment left me with one final utter eff that place

on the bright side this has motiv me to start write review instead of onli read them

 denot thing about a breakfast that would make me want to punch a kittenpeopl know the bf and i are veri respect and appreci of restaur staff so it will probabl come to a surpris that our experi was so upset that i will make sure they lose more busi than just mine  i will pay for my friend to have a dessert on us somewher els if they promis not to set foot at a serendip sure im treat like you didnt need my patronag but you sure as fuck dont know if i would have been treat with respect i would come back everi year and bought myself a stupid gold opul or want to throw a serendip partyeven if i didnt throw mad money around everi custom is a valuabl person and valuabl advertising

so i have out of town visitor from seattl here who had serendip on their list i call to inquir about close time and they said they close at midnightthen she add but that depend on how much wait there is i ask what she meant and all she did was repeat herself whatev we had plenti of time so hung up and walk over there we got through one of the side door and stand in the dine hall was a bit confusedw stood there and no one greet us so we figur mayb the hostess was on the other side and walk there to inquir about where to sit becaus i dont want to mess up their zone system and sit myself where im not suppos to she said dine room seat was close but that the togo station was still open for frozen hot chocol so she said to go ahead and go to that line at this point it was 1128pmthey said they close at midnight

a soon as we got in line there was a guy who decid to give the coupl in front of us a sign that say it end of the line he said oh sorri but theyr the last peopl we were alreadi stand there befor hand  i explain how weve been stand there and that the hostess told us to line up and that it was okay to still order to go he then goe no it close and i alreadi told them that theyr the last peopl and theyr gonna get free frozen hot chocol serious you cant let 3 more  pay  custom get chocol i realli didnt care about the asshol give the peopl in front of us free i just want my guest to be abl to get all they want out of their vacat i was will to pay and still hold the fuck sign 

 the line has to end somewher and it end with them he was veri high and mighti about it he look like he enjoy turn us away the hostess told us to come order sinc we were stand for quit a while wait for tabl servic we didnt want to argu with someon who wouldnt budg from be the way they are no one els around us look remot like they want to line up we were alreadi there and were just 3 peopl look to pay for some premad fuck drink 30 minut befor closingit not like it much troubl  my bf is non violent but he want to punch this guy in the nut i told him it too kind 

now that might seem like an exagger to go punch someon over chocol but it the principl of be treat like dirt it about custom servic and hold a standard to where your reput uphold expect of an great experi it rare you meet someon that hell bent on win battl becaus of their posit to make themselv feel bettery you ruin my day so you got what you want and hope that one day this attitud will reap you some reward and get you royal fuck 

just becaus this place is famous doesnt mean itll hold up for long sure some folk will come for the name the signatur dessert  but with more and more peopl do review and spread the word your go to tank if you dont know how to treat peopl a bad reput exceed the good and seem like im not alon here in the review a woman scorn from her dessert has a fire like no other you alreadi lost 4 custom plus the hundr of tourist i know believ me and my text power im fuck viral with a nicknam as the yelp ambassador  my goal is to let peopl  have the best experi possibl in vega i cant ever let them step foot here simpli even for the fact that how can i guarante them a good experi i cant and that look bad on me if i didnt tell them about my time here 

dessert is suppos to be funwher is the joy in this place 

pleas walk over to max brenner in the forum shop it save my night see review and you know what their chocol granita shit on the frozen hot chocol here it was definit higher qualiti chocol at mbs  im alreadi plan my trip back thereugh i was made to go here becaus i have famili in town and they realli dont understand my valu are a big deal to me if i boycott a place i dont care if im starv i wont do it but the louder of opinion in the group won and i have no say sinc it isnt my vacat so the bf and i kept them compani while they ate their over price and over rate item 

there wasnt anyth that was gonna get us to order someth or even tast what peopl are order so i have noth much to say on food and will just quot what peopl said at the tabl 

mi one brother whos definit a foodi wasnt happi with his frozen chocol what he said was a melt milkshak and he would have been better off with a in n out milkshak then i found out he want to come with me instead to max brenner sigh and we did go the next day while famili shop anoth brother got coffe and it was noth special the kid like their dessert but theyr kid i can put sugar on roach and theyd think it a crunchi goodtim my sister had a sunda and it was fair standard my cousin had a cake that was super in size and had a lot of leftov but he said it was good 

servic wasnt rude this time but it wasnt realli hit servic standard it was more like take the order bring it and if you need the check go find them dessert took about 35 minut to come one person came late and order after everyon els they got a slice of cake and that didnt come around until way later when most peopl had their dessert donecak doesnt even need to be prepar so it shouldnt take 50 minut to receiv it just put it on a fuck plate and add whip cream and a strawberry

wel just confirm to me i wasnt just hate in my first review this place isnt that great with servic nor expedit order  dessert shouldnt take almost 2 hour special sinc were one of the last reserv of the night 

stop buy into brand name serendip lost the charm that made it sucess in the first locat decad ago serendip doesnt live to it name and is just bad misfortun with each visit 

avoid10 milkshak  about three sip of milkshak and half of the small cup was whip cream  

tremend ripoff even by vega standard  get thee to burger bar for a fantast milkshakare you serious

whi in the world is this place so popular i realli wish it wasnt so i wouldnt have been tempt to go and wast my time and money

1 took them 1520 minut to bring us water we just came from a pool parti and we were sooo dehydr it shouldnt realli matter where we came from everyon is dehydr in vega it a desert hello can we pleas have some water asap 

2 food took a million year to come out

3 food was mediocr at best the 30 rib were so dri they tast like dirt the pasta had no flavor the omelett was okay the burger was okay too but we couldv gone somewher els and paid the same price for much better food regrets

4 the frozen hot chocol they brought me the onli thing i realli want to come for look and tast terribl well i guess it tast alright like ici hot chocol basic but right when they brought it out it was melt all over i couldnt even get a good pictur in i had to send it back i have never sent back anyth in my life but i was not about to pay 15 is that how much it is for that no thank you they brought the tabl next to me prettier frozen hot chocol whi did mine suck whatev save 15 i guess

dont wast your time peopl go elsewher 

extrem disappoint as i was realli look forward to tri this placedecid to run in here becaus it close for a quick sushi dinner and afterward we wish we hadnt  they were not nice to us it was like we were inconvenienc them even though there were mani mani empti tables

so as we are talk with the hostess work on be seat some snooti chick come up interrupt and say um we need to be seat now  the hostess then ask is your parti all here which is necessari when you are do the teppanyaki and the girl said no but they will be real soon so we need to do this now

i want to slap that girl  where are these peopl manner that their momma taught them  i dont care of you think you look like hot shit i was here first so dont interrupt and then proceed to be rude

so we order some of the specialti roll  and were told some 10 minut later that one of the two we order is not avail  so i pick anoth  wait anoth 10 minut  then was told the other one of the origin wasnt available

 really

so i actual had to ask the server so which one can i order where ill actual be abl to get it

bad news  im real easi go becaus i know just how hard that job is but come on

i just love be ignor too no acknowledg no hope you enjoy your food no do you need a refil wrong

dont appreci it

th onli good part of the whole night was a server name steven who came up and joke with us when deliv the last roll  that was the highlight

 decid im not go backexperi all the pretens of california pizza kitchen with none of the servic or pizza serious how snooti and obnoxi is it when the drink section list onli an assort of bottl water and italian soda then at the bottom in small print if you simpli must have it we also carri cola lemonlim and dr p as though they are do us lowli soft drink partak a favor by sink to our level yet when press they still wouldnt reveal whether their cola was coke pespi or someth els some of us care yo 

we onli came here becaus we won a 50 gift card and i would never come back the hostess was nice but the servic end there our server was snippi look angri the whole time screw up our drink twice then snap at us when we tri to correct her our pizza was onli bare cut we most had to rip it apart ourselv and the busboy kept tri to take our plate befor we were done and without ask 

the pizza were vagu interest in theori but not veri good in practic there were veri few option in the way of regular pizza if you didnt want to tri one of their mani theme pizza bbq chicken pizza pasta pizza enchilada pizza etc we tri the shrimp scampi pizza which was tough and undercook and the meati meati pizza which was okay but had about six piec of meat on the entir larg size pizza 

overal it was a free meal and we left full but it was uncomfort and onli moder tasti i would certain not come here again and pay  given their extraordinari price a larg and small pizza two soda and a garlic bread appet for 52 mediocr pizza and lousi servic definit skip this placei go to this tropic smoothi at least onc a week if not more  in fact some of the peopl that work here alreadi know my order befor i order  i love tropic smoothi this locat and the staffbut the owner  not so much
 
mi foundat reach out to the owner to tri and have a fundrais where a certain percentag of proceed would go back to our organ  the respons we receiv indic that they onli like to do fundrais if they are sure the organ will bring them abov and beyond their normal busi  what happen to hold a fundrais to give back to the communiti and organ  we have done fundrais befor and while the compani hope to bring new andor more busi that isnt one of their requir  strike one
 
on flip flop day where they offer free smoothi to all custom wear flip flop between 2pm and 7pm they stop hand out smoothi befor 7  the disclaim wasnt for the first x amount of peopl or even until suppli last  if they were run out of ingredi the least they could have done was offer custom a rain check for a differ visit  i donat 5 for a key fob and went on my way but this was strike two
 
this past 4th of juli they sent a text messag offer for 99 sunris sunset after 3pm  when i got there there was a sign on the door indic that they are not accept text messag anymor  strike three
 
if your go to run a busi where the parent compani like to hold various promot and discount then all of the locat should particip or the compani should indic that the promot is onli at particip locat  and if you want to limit how mani peopl can take advantag of the promot then use the disclaim while suppli last  unless of cours you like disappoint customi was sold on love hut until i recent discov they dont even use organ veget all the glitz and glamour of save the planet go green and advoc fork over knive but they use the cheap pesticid fill veggi everybodi els doe or possibl worsegmo it is a sham i just assum they would be organ sinc that what be vegan and healthi is all about but it just more trick from a busi tri to turn a profit from peopl look for healthi altern just call and ask and they will tell you they dont use organ unacceptrude rude rude onli go here if you enjoy be swear at

mi review of this place is poor becaus this is the worst servic and quit frank the rudest that ive ever been treat i call to order a deliveri dinner on a week night even and no it wasnt super late it was around 7pm i spoke to someon who had a snotti attitud toward me and told me that it would cost me a 5 deliveri charg i ask whi becaus accord to the flyer that i receiv i was within the deliveri area and that it was onli 150 he refus to answer me until i ask for the third time and then he told me that it was becaus they onli had one driver i ask whi it would cost me extra to have someth deliv when i am in the deliveri area just becaus they onli had one driver his respons was and i quot take it or get the hell off my phone i was so shock that all i could do was hang up ive encount some dissatisfi servic but i have never been sworn at while tri to give someon my money i will never eat at this place again and i also work at asu and have warn all of my cowork about this we tend to eat out a lot around the area to support local busi but none of us will ever go here againi have been go to sammi for a littl less than a year after find it on restaurantcom  i like it enough to purchas addit coupon for it but i would onli go onc a month or onc everi 2  3 month  i live on the west side of town and this is on the east side of town so it wasnt all that convenient

i had gone the other day after pick up a friend from the airport and when i present my coupon i was told that as of novemb 1st he the owner was no longer go to accept the coupon  i said i had more coupon at home  he said i should bring in what i had and start use them befor nov 1st   i had 5 more coupon  

the next day i call him to verifi the use of the coupon  i also ask him sinc he wasnt go to be accept them anymor can i use more than 1 sinc there was go to be 4 of us go there the next day  he said one coupon per email per day  i said fine  

next day roll around and i bring in 3 friend he said i wasnt go to be allow to use them   he said the rule state 1 coupon per month  i said but you told me the other day plus i call yesterday  all he could do was repeat the rule of restaurantcom of one a month  he said he lose money everi time the coupon is use  after he and i both were repeat each other in frustrat i final got him to admit well i chang my mind

at that point my friend who i had also just pick up from the airport start to chime in to tell the owner off  i was quit embarrass that this was happen in front of my out of town guest  after i had told them what a great place this was for pastrami

at that point we decid not to give him our patronag  i will never be go back there again so his statement can hold trueh will lose money

i would have been perfect all right if he did not say to me to bring the rest of the coupon in or to tell me when i call that i wouldnt be abl to use them  not for him to tell me after i get there  how inconsiderive onli been to sammi onc but unfortun that was one too mani time  i hate this place  it doesnt take long onc set foot insid this dump to realiz that you are in the wrong restaur and you should have kept drive  everywher you look there is noth but filth  the wall are dirti the floor is dirti the custom are smelli and obes but the biggest piec of filth is the owner himself  he talk incess and has an ego like hes 7 feet tall when he is realli about 411  all he doe is brag about how awesom sammi is  on top of this he is extrem rude to pay custom  

after pay about 8 more than the food should actual cost you have to be lucki to get a seat at one of the three dirti tabl  most like you will be wait about 25 minut befor your food is readi  at this point you are probabl starv and hope the food is as good as the owner talk it up to be  im sorri to say that you will be sore disappoint  i had a burger and some of the so call delici fri  i would rate the burger at or below that of your averag fast food place  the fri were over season and flat out disgust  i hit the door run after choke down my food and have never look back  ive had sever nightmar about this place sinc this incid and now whenev i meet someon name sammi i automat despis them  pleas avoid this place at all costi jog by ice tango today for 10th or 12th time in the past 3 week well i was head over to the canal for my run and while i was run as fast as i could im pretti sure it look like a gentl jog to the race fan up and down scottsdal roadbut i digress

i again saw the same sign on the door that has been there for at least 3 week sinc i first notic itclos today will reopen tomorrowtomorrow has never come

i slow my pace to a slow walk and look into the dark dank interior of ice tangoth machin are all deadth counter have crap all over themexcept where there dust all over themnot even the glow from the from the cordless phoneit look like the power is disconnected

i hope it wasnt someth i saidive never felt as unwelcom in a restaur as i did last night at gallo blanco 

mi friend dixon and i were particip in a mass bike ride through town call critic mass the organ has an arrang with the clarendon hotel which is the locat for gallo blanco as far as we knew it was mutual understood that the cyclist were welcom to come by after the ride grab a drink and use the pool

from the moment we walk in the gm was all over the two of us i should make it clear that neither of us have anyth to do with organ the event it was almost as if he thought we were tri to pull one over on him when we repeat told him we were not organ and thought everyth was agre upon in advance

honest im not sure what differ it make anyway as we were just like ani other patron dress normal and want to get a drink from the bar our mode of transport should not have made ani differ at all he said this is my restaur to us as if we were not want there

th gm could sens my annoy even though he was interrog dixon he look over and offer to buy us a drink when this all get sort out he then point us over to the corner and told us to just wait over here i can understand not want a chaotic scene in a dine room but this was insult the gm never return to tell us he had spoken to our leader

aft a few minut of stand around in the corner we went to the bar to order drink while order the gm walk up but said noth he did not make good on his promis to buy a drink for our troubl which wasnt realli surprising

i wish i had even one thing nice to say about this venu becaus im sure under differ circumst it would have been a good experi 

i doubt i will be drive or bike to gallo blanco ani time in the futuri use to enjoy come to this place but my experi this past weekend prompt me to sign up for yelp and write this review  when i came here a few week ago i figur the horribl servic was a fluke but the too cool to notic you staff this weekend confirm the disappoint turn in custom service

her are the highlight of the night

1  pick up friend from the airport and arriv at gallo blanco befor 10pm
2  ask for a tabl for 5 and were told that the wait would be 1520 minut which was not a problem for us
3  1020pm  decid to chang the parti number to 4 sinc one friend wasnt abl to make it anymore
4  seat a few minut later to a dine room and patio at 40 capac  really
5  menus and water brought to the table
6  10301035pm  staff consist ignor my fiancé who was tri to track down our server sinc we were readi to order  dure this time we saw other tabl be tend to and wait on
7  walk out of the restaur  the hostess server and other staff fail to notic or say anyth as we left

 it understand if the restaur was busi but the dine room was practic empti at the time my fiancé was tri to get someon attent  mayb it becaus were asian but i guess the staff felt we didnt deserv the attent they gave to the other cool hipster peopl there that night  i felt aw for bring my friend here and wast their precious time on their quick trip to phoenix  thank gallo blanco for wast an hour of my life  your food is not good enough to deserv a repeat visita gift shop in the bar i am not the too cool for school type but realli cheesi atmospher chain bad servic and gift shop  sorri in this case 4 strike you are outgood look wait staff big place  beer overpr  sound system substandard  video system poor  oversold venu full of plaid western shirt wear children  dont believ ill return  sorri tobi your joint sucki use to love this bar but it gone downhil in term of servic and clientel we went out for a friend birthday last night and i was surpris to find that a bar that pride itself on be a neighborhoodtyp countri bar now charg a cover for guy at least

i love the live band and last night was no differ they rock i was disappoint to find that the crowd was near half the size of what i rememb though the place use to fill up mayb it the cover that turn peopl away 

or mayb it the bad service

at the end of the night we had a difficult time flag down one of the mani bartend to close our tab becaus they were preoccupi with clean up when we final got one attent she roll her eye ask for our last name and then repli you open your tab wayyyi on the other side of the bar she roll her eye again and then reluct fetch it becaus you know that her job and then slap it down on the bar top befor us without so much as a thank you

w notic there was a charg for a jack daniel 850 for one btw forgot to mention that their price have gone up we never purchas and when we brought this up to anoth bartend we got the same amount of attitud and not a singl apolog 

ive work in the servic industri and certain understand how at the end of the night your more than readi to clean up and get out of there but that no reason to treat your patron so poor especi sinc the crowd appear to be thinning

i dont know that well be head to tobi keith anytim soon ill take a good dj over their fabul live music if it mean im tend to by a mixologist who make me feel welcom and appreci and mayb one who smile tobi keith i dont like this bar 

thank im a girl and it was free to get in or id be angri the poor guy who have to pay that so dumb 

it was basic imposs for anyon to get serv here everyon at the bar was get irrit becaus no one could get drink and when youd place an order youd have to wait forev again just to get the drink same stori when your readi to close your tab either their bartend are horribl or theyr insan understaf 

regardless we left becaus it was horriblstop by on a saturday afternoon and the place was  a ghost town
w were just there for drink sand order vodka soda with lime the bartend was nice but went mia often the club soda tast veri strang almost sweet our drink were serv in red plastic cup while the coupl next to us got glassnot sure what that was all about

th particular day i was there it was freez insid while it was in the 90s outsid the bare cloth bartend told us she is not allow to wear a jacket over her uniform 
this repuls me as i see who i assum was the manag a big buff tattoo guy strut around the restaurant

plac that put sexual befor employe comfort disgust mereceiv two more messag from iolanda this morn  thought some of you might get a kick out of read them  im definit never go back to 98 south  hope this info help some of you  btw dont you just love orangehead  dole out insult are so much easier when hide behind a mask

19 minut ago obvious rebutt is not your friend but jealous is your neighbor

9 minut ago thought the drink was for your gentleman friend but your the one that had to abandon ityou realli shouldnt have your pictur post pug i mean easi targetlet go west side yeppidear brio

yea hmm wow no worri i found anoth place that welcom me with open arm for my birthday happi hour and they dont mind if we stand around and get a littl rowdi  

love
ebdisappoint that sum up my two experi with this dunkin donut 

this locat is right around the corner from my hous we are not  donut connoisseur or food snob so our expect are pretti fair and reason we usual buy donut from walmart or albertson but will make a trip out to krispi kreme on occas we are big junk food eater though so when my wife and i first heard a dunkin donut was go into the shop plaza we were veri excit the day it open there was some buzz in our neighborhood and within a few day we stop in with the family

mi first thought was disappoint in the varieti and select year ago when i use to visit a differ dunkin donut on a semiregular basi i realli enjoy all the differ type of donut from jelli and kreme fill to glaze and chocol cake they didnt have chocol or bavarian kreme fill none of the chocol cover cake donut frank the select is much better at the super walmart down the road

w quick pick a dozen donut and head home eager to dig in again we were onli disappoint the vanilla kreme fill donut were incred skimpi on fill the glaze donut were dens and not light and fluffi two day later we end up throw away 4 left over donut and that has never happen in this house

th second trip was near ident we were disappoint by the select and the tastequ was an even bigger disappoint i can onli assum they must be tri to cut cost by be so skimpi with the donut fill 

in pass convers with other in our neighborhood theyv express similar experi we will not be return for a third trip it back to walmart and albertson donut until krispi kreme build a store a littl closer to our hous shame on dunkin donut for be so cheap at the expens of it qualiticall marc doesnt deserv the titl chef imo anymor tonight to talk about the dinner the other night he was rude right off the bat and said that other help wouldnt serv us and that he comp he meal bs he gave us the chicken parma to take home didnt come to the tabl when his under train staff screw up a few time wrong food brought tl the tabl etc ive been there mayb 78 time sinc move here and onli one other time there was an issu with the chicken parma but the food wasnt the problem it was that blad so call server screw up and forgot to put the order in diana and the asian server has alway been a the blad guy can go work at mc donald but to marc ive been rais in famili restur and know the busi much better than you whi did you rais the price at the pizza joint and start make the pizza smaller poor manag period you need to tske the respons of your short come you are a poor busi man and just rememb karma boy now we will go find anoth place to spend our money at bottom line you disrespect me on the phone and will never go back to your over price strip mall place plus i make a better chicken parm also and to think i want to work at the new place now i also see whi your turnov at the pizza joint is like it is a poor busi man is not what anyon want to work forworst coffeerel experi ever 

i will say the beverag were pretti good not aweinspir but good 

but the servic suck 

it was my first time there and i wasnt sure what i want but had been sent with drink order from some friend it start poor i stood at the counter for sever minut without a singl person either befor or after me and was not so much as greet ive work in a cafe and that should just not ever happen if they can greet you over the head of 30 travel at an airport starbuck i should at least be abl to get a hello at a desol cafe 

second there was no tea on their menu so i final ask the dude behind the counter about order i ask him about a tea order for my compadr he look at a paper behind the regist told me what i was look for exist and rang me up for it 

i guess my biggest complaint is the tone of condescens that was present from the time i open the door to the time i left even the 4 middleag patron look at me like i wasnt trendi enough to be there i may not have a snazzi haircut or be walk in with a fanci mac book but i am still intellig enough to pick up on attitud and as far as i know my money is just as good as anyon els 

i will absolut never go to this locat againthis compani fals advertis an allyoucaneat breakfast not mention that it is onli avail on saturday and sunday  so i went in on a weekday think that it was avail travel well out of my way to tri it  you can imagin my disappoint when the cashier told me when it was avail and walk away from me when i polit suggest that the sign be chang to reflect that it was a weekend onli offer

lat on feel that this matter need to be brought to the attent of other i file a formal complaint with the better busi bureau of las vega nv but to show you how littl the compani care about their reput and custom satisfact they never respond at all to my perfect proper complaint

check out their bbb rate and you will see that they have an f rate and right so

i wont ever visit them again  onc was enough for menobodi in here and servic is horribl waitress hasnt come around one time fli everywher and were insid no excus i had a pizza that was not good at alli want to like this place as it is in the neighborhood and there arent mani other option around here but this is probabl the worst restaurantbar ive ever had the misfortun of go to 

mi last trip i sat down to order a beer at the bar  the bartend take about five minut to get me a beer despit the bar be near empti as he was too busi for me with his time and focus instead spent flirt with one of the server  

i drink my beer and want anoth  the glass sit empti for about five minut while he pace around the bar  i tri on three occas to get his attent and ask for anoth  the dude is just ignor me at this point  i guess they dont want my busi and i just leav  he can have the 8 cent he owe me in chang for a tip i just want out of here  i feel bad when i leav that he even got the 8 cent from me  i hope he spend it well

on other trip here my wife and i have had the food  it not ani better than the servic sad  i have an english bulldog at home with a poop eat problem and im not sure he would even find this food accept  overal just the worst restaur around and it no surpris whi the place alway look so dead out front  nobodi there becaus it simpli horribl  avoid at all cost  i wouldnt eat here again but would give the bar anoth shot if i heard the replac all the help  whoever own this place need to clean hous  look at other review on here i see im not alon in my feel about the servic  get rid of these peopl alreadi just sadgot bug no want bug yes i have your place  appar 

first nice open space modern but comfort with a nice atmospher that isnt too loud or too quiet 

most import i dont eat bug voluntarili i know call me odd but it just isnt my thing up until my visit to the parlor not one singl person had made me feel odd or unwarr in my prefer to avoid consum bugsahhh but all good thing must come to an end even our hope and dream of accept 

so let stick with the fact the smokey a pizza and anoth pizza we order were deliv to our tabl i quick notic someth move on the arugula on top of the smokey i attempt to wave it away think it was a fruit fli my menac wave had no impact and then i notic that in fact there were at least 3 or more bug move about the arugula with furious vengeanc i wave at them again noth ok not eat this pizza 

so i call the waiter over and told him that there were bug on the pizza now this is where our stori take an odd turn realli we probabl have all found a bug in our food at some point so that not veri odd 

the waiter respond  well that what happen when you dont use pesticid and the food is organ he then call over anoth waiter and told her that there were bug on our pizza she inspect and conclud that it was so whereupon she ask would you like someth differ 

ok part of me was expect the camera crew to emerg but ala candid camera has long sinc gone away and instead we were have a great moment in phoenix restaur servic histori 

realli do we want someth differ no no now that we know that the bug are organ we will eat that pizza and heck order us anoth with extra bug 

and come onit organicthat your respons  i have organ veget deliv to me twice a month and i have never had ani bug grant i do wash my produc also my parent had a larg garden when i was younger no pesticid and often there were bug on the veget but and appar this is a strang concept we wash them off befor eat or serv or store 

i understand bug happen what i dont understand is the respons we receiv we truli felt like we were be odd for send back the pizza i know that the servic level in phoenix often hover around a 3 to 4 out of 10 but realli this was a new low i wasnt expect the owner to come on out on his or her knee but i did expect someth along the line of oh im veri sorri let me take that away and get you a menu so you can select someth els 

sure eventu there was a rather late sorri and an offer of a free dessert but it was a littl late for that 

on the upsid it made for great humor when the waiter ask us if we had been there befor i was half expect if we had both said no she would have said well that pizza alway has bug on it and when she ask if we need help pick someth out i realli want to say yes someth without bug unfortun i kept the joke to myself 

the pizza we did eat was ok the crust lack flavor and overal it wasnt on par with the like of cibo humbl pie or bianco

i could get over the bug but i have a veri hard time swallow such terribl servic 

wait mayb there is a camera on me right now as i write this and candid camera realli has come backthat the best explan i havemy goal on saturday night was to stay home and just relax  i should have listen to that goal

i have been to the parlor mani time in the past year and alway enjoy my food and servic i have to say that my one experi there that i had saturday night will guarante that i never step foot in this place ever again  this isnt someth about it be an off nightmanag prove that they just do not care about their guests

around 6 oclock through twitter the special came through for the night  they had list a prime sirloin with a pesto spread and potato and broccolini  sinc my friend jill and i end up share almost the same brain she text me immedi that we should go there and tri it out  i was game  i even call over to the parlor to ask about the special and if there was a wait

15 minut later at 7 oclock jill and her boyfriend toni show up and put their name on the wait list  about 10 minut after i show up we were seat we sat down and immedi told the server that we want 3 special  toni the server not be confus with bf toni regrett told us that they were out of the special after i order an ice tea sinc jill has gluten and dairi allergi there wasnt anyth els she could eat there  we ask to speak with the manag befor we would make up our mind to just leav  server toni ask me if he should hold off on the tea and i told him yes  the ice tea is import to this event

th manag who i believ her name was monicanot 100 sure came up and act veri defens about run out of the specialeven befor we had the opportun to explain our situat  jill said that i even call befor to make sure about the special and there wasnt anyth els she could eat  manag excus herself came back and state that they could use a flank steak instead  we ask what the price would be for that and she said the same price  for a flank steak  that isnt even close to the qualiti of a prime sirloin  manag monica  said that she would comp us either drink or dessert  we decid to staysilli peopl we were

serv toni came back with my ice teathough i never told him that i want it again  he ask if everyth was taken care of  we said yes and that the manag said that she would comp drinksso we all order glass of wine  toni leav and then come back to tell us that manag monica told him that she would comp us dessert and 2 off our entre  sinc jill cant eat the dessert and that wasnt what was discuss we ask for the manag again

ent eric  i have to say that i never met a bigger jackass in my life  he come up to us and say my name is eric and the parlor is consid my place  as we make special you have to understand that it isnt an exact scienc  sometim we run out of thing  fine we get that  i told him that the not have a special is now a moot point sinc his manag offer us someth that she is now reneg on he face me and say have you ever work in a high stress environ befor  sometim we say thing that we just think about then  i told him that yes i have work in a high volum stress workplac befor and as a manag i honor what come out of my mouth  i am sorri but if you cant trust your manag with make decis in a high stress environ then you need to rethink your staff  he then back pedal and said that he would comp the whole bill for us if that is what we want  we told him we werent look for a free meal but ok  food came and he left


wel of cours the flank steak cook medium rare what not up to par and veri tough the broccolini had absolut no flavor  the potato were great though  

of cours this isnt the end of the stori  the bill came and i am not shit youth onli thing on the bill was my ice tea  after all of that you couldnt comp my ice tea along with everyth els we should have left then becaus a few minut later the server came back and told us that he hand us the wrong bill  the correct bill was drink comp 3 entre for 12 and still my ice tea  yes this is a big deal to me  we couldnt believ it  

if a restaur is not prepar for a special for saturday night a high volum day then you shouldnt even offer a special  as a friend said to me today this is a pizza joint and they should just stick to pizza and not offer these other special just to get us in 

custom servic come a long way especi in our economi  i will be will to pay for good food and good servic  the parlor prove that they have neitheri have never been to a sushi restaur where i had to actual stop eat becaus the food was so gross first time for everything

th salmon nigiri was so tough that i couldnt bite it in half it was almost rubberi the other sushi plate we had four in all smell veri fishi mix with the faint odor of clean fluid

th fri roll tast like they had been cook in veri old oil

th price were extrem reason and the restaur itself was decent in term of tone and decor i like that they gave you complimentari miso and salad although i didnt care for the salad dressing

in all definit a place i will never return to againgot the wing hereplain and simpletheyr aw bare ani meat veri dri no flavor wont be back

update
th i assum owner of this fine establish decid to email me about my review on their wingsth follow is the correspond between myself and meridith if this is how they treat their custom i serious dont understand how theyv manag to stay open for a so call 40 years

messag from meridith
w were sauc like they alway are if you read the menu you could have gotten the wing sloppi our wing are the same size as everi where els in the valley tri our pizza next time weve been in busi for 40 year we must be do someth right you can tri papa johns

respons messag from me
dont be angri caus you have horribl wingsnot everyon can get them right so dont feel bad i cant say anyth about your pizza caus ive never had it but even so i doubt id go back just to tri it
sureyour wing are the same size as everyon els in the valleya far as the bone goe but it the amount of meat on the bone which count and that right there is where your wing are trueli inferior
your wing were purchas to feed a parti of peopl dure a box match on ppv and everi singl person at the parti who ate the wing all said they were horribleso for your sake i hope that we just got a bad batch or someth caus none of those peopl there said they would ever go to your restaur for wings
it was veri immatur and unprofession to messag me and talk to me in such a way about the issu when instead you should be more focus on tri to find out what the issu was and fix it i will be do a follow up to my review to show everyon how you treat your custom over a matter of simpli have their own opinion about your food if it just so happen to be a negat opinion

sound like a serious lack of custom servic skill on their part look like ill be get my wing from papa john from now onsigh what a serious tragedylolavoid a complet rip off and terribl servic this place is suppos to be a michelin star restaur ha what a joke i wouldnt insult nobu by compar this place to them 

just becaus they have a fanci look joint insid a beauti casino mean they think they can get away with murder the food is so bland and so uninspir and sooo expens listen i have no problem pay more for qualiti food but serious examples

22 for a standard bore salmon  avocado sushi roll you would pay 6 for in an averag sushi joint 
28 for bbq lamb which was small bowl of greasi and fri onion the lamb wasnt even nice it was mix up and greasi like youd get from a kebab truck  extort 

to add insult to injuri the servic was soooo slow and sooooo imperson and sooooo bad the waiter couldnt describ ani of the item of the menu so suggest no effort whatsoev even more frustrat they made us wait for half an hour for a tabl of two when we final get in it turn out the place was virtual empti they had wait staff just stood around talk is this wait suppos to make us feel like were not worthi enough for this piec of shit joint are we suppos to believ that this place is super hard to get in to 

did i say avoid this placefor a high end name like jean georg this restaur is ridicul amateur and lowclass  the substandard food and question dimlylit dine room do noth to improv the eat experi  

first my girlfriend and i were poor greet by the two hostess  when we approach them one immedi ask do you have reserv caus we arent take walkin you know in a pari hiltonwannab tone  i repli polit that i did with a smile  she roll her eye  the other hostess gave me a wimpi death stare that look more like the face of indigest than one of menac  the first hostess ask us to follow her into the dine room after confirm the name  she did not proper sit us down eg fail to hand us our menus or pull out chair etc  if she knew anyth about proper dine etiquett she would not have stack the menus on the plate like some ogr play jenga tm  she abrupt walk away without say a word  nevertheless i was determin to salvag this experi    

unfortun as the even march on i learn that it was not go to happen  our food was subpar  the foie gras was okay  the bread was heavili butter  my plate was veri greasi the moment i laid the bread piec down  unfortun this made the alreadi rich cours even denser  the lobster caesar a special request was plain but decent  my girlfriend and i order the new york and filet mignon respect as our main cours  they were perfect cook but unbear salti to the point that they were ined  when i complain about the entre to the waiter slight overweight 30ish and bald he said i am sorri you feel that way and walk away  i could have rais a storm and complain even further but i decid it was not kosher to caus a scene 

after drink and dessert my tab was 330 for 2 peopl  now ask yourself this would you pay that much for a watereddown version of a jean georg restaur with poor food and servic  if you crave for a vongerichten restaur treat yourself to a flight to ny and eat there

 updat 

i receiv a messag from a dummi account  which might have been from an employe or someon relat to the restaur  attempt to shoot down my review  here what hesh wrote

th consist of this review is total inacur jg had never had a lobster caesar and host dont present dinner menus either the server doe  ramon l

i responded

befor you claim a review is inaccur note that your experi and opinion may be differ from mine  in my case the hostess plant our menus on our plate  our waiter was not even prepar to greet us until a coupl of minut later as he was fuss with two other staff member near the back cashier  even if the hostess was not train to hand us our menus proper this doe not excus her unprofession demeanor dure the entir greet process

also the lobster caesar was a request  it did the job but it was not special or elev  i edit the review to make a note of the special request to avoid further confus  also if you are question the valid of my review i have photo on my cellphon two of which are upload on yelp and a credit card bill i love food all kind of food from the hole in the wall burger joint taqueria or dumpl hous to the high end patina group restaur i eat out a great deal im well into my quest to eat at everi restaur in pasadena but i actual dont write mani reviews

aft my experi at jean georg steakhous this past weekend i knew i had to write someth so congratul to them for get my first negat review

th servic was on the low end of accept but that is someth i can live with if the food is good sad it wasnt except for the tomato soup that was fantastic

th bacon wrap shrimp was too salti and greasi the mash potato were salti and veri runni the medium rare fillet show up with a heavi char these are veri standard and simpl to prepar dish that ive had mani other place and this is one of the reason that i order them they are a litmus test if you use qualiti ingredi and prepar the dish with care there no excus to not do them well i mean serious who mess up mash potato especi one that cost 1200

i ask the waiter to bring the manag over and i describ and show him the food i prefac my discuss by say that i wasnt do this to get a discount i want to let him know of some thing that were go on in the kitchen and that i expect much better  i didnt insist on new food as that realli isnt my way he thank me and went off he didnt return and the bill was for the entir meal this is clear one of the option open to him as was offer to make me a new steak or take the runni salti potato off the bill instead he chose the option that realli prompt this review

a i left the manag ask me to come again now whi would i want to do that this also show a distinct lack of awar or serious i am tell my vega friend and travel companion that we can do much better than jean georg steakhousi was extrem disappoint in this sad excus for a restaur especi becaus of it locat in the gorgeous aria resort the decor is absolut beauti the food was mediocr at best the servic was just bad

first of all my parti of four was direct to our tabl after a few minut wait there were onli three chair and three place set we awkward stood in the middl of the restaur until someon carri over anoth chair from across the room the fact that they were so unorgan even after keep us wait is unaccept for ani restaur and veri unprofessional

i order the late breakfast of two egg sausag and ask what their substitut were for the hash brown and toast this seem a foreign concept becaus our waitress had no idea i ask if they could substitut for cottag chees as mani other breakfast place do and she said shed have to ask the chef my boyfriend order a hamburg minus the bun and she couldnt perceiv that idea either most restaur are will and abl to make substitut for guest this restaur made me feel realli uncomfort even suggest the idea

aft all of this confus the servic was realli slow it took ten minut after be seat at our tabl for the waitress to come around to take our order 

the food itself was sad my thirteen dollar meal could have been better put togeth by mcdonald i tast my bfs burger it may have been one of the most unappet ground beef patti ive ever tast it was overcook hard and bland except for a chemic smoke tast my poor honey suffer through that for 15 no less my bff had the biscuit and gravi and left half of her meal she never leav half of her meal 

i happen to rememb the price of what everyon order probabl becaus it was so high for what you get which was a good thing becaus the price on the menu was not consist with the charg on the bill appar they recent chang the menus so the price increas but we all order off of old menus either way the manag was unhelp and unapologet fix their mistak that type of attitud is not what i expect in a premier aria restaurant

pleas aria pleas clean hous in that restaur and hire compet manag an interest head chef and welltrain wait staff the facil is so gorgeous and need to be appreci with cuisin compliment it beauti not distract us from the unaccept servic and fooddanger danger 

water spillag all over the restaur i slip and fell 

as i tri lift myself up assum i had trip becaus of the late night drink in vega i find a puddl of water all over the ground i was lay at wth do they not have sign state bewar wet spot ahead i would like warn sign so i can avoid danger situat 

i report the mess to manag in charg joaquin hope they can clean the mess instant   lucki i am young and dont have tender bone if an older person would have slip they would have gotten a concuss or broke a few bone  

his line what do you want me to do about it call you an ambul

 mam i am sorri let me clean up the mess and see what i can do for you  

disrespect horribl custom service

a i wasnt in the right state of mind to make the right logic decis my last line to joaquin is  what your name i am go to write you a horribl bad custom servic review on yelp 

not onli was i the onli one who slip on a puddl of water but anoth of friend of mine also said they had slip while walk to the bathroom his exact word i actual slip and couldnt get back up i tri lift myself up but there was to much water on the ground spill drink that i slip twice in the same locat  
 

if you want to break a few bone feel free to walk into this establish  
stop number 3 on our micro brew mini crawl  this locat of sin citi breweri kindablow  it is tuck into a corner of the flamingo casino it is small it is sin citi theme allupinyourgril and overthetop  and yet there is basic noth go on in or around the place  kindablows

i had the amber which frank tast like a gussi up domest brew  think a slight improvedbudweis  in a plastic cup  for about 6 buck  kindablows

th one upsid was the seat area outsid  it not particular attach to the bar but it is right outsid  it was a cool februari even in vega and there was some nice seat around a fire pit where we sat and talk and stay warm for over an hourthis place has big portion which explain their higher price menu  this place is hard to miss but with the five sign out on the front  how can you miss this place  when you go insid you will notic pink sheet of paper with sign state onli order water if you are go to drink it  and if our servic isnt up to your standard you should lower them  sarcasm at it best  so i order pho ga one time and the owner brought out pho tai  she told me she thought i said pho tai   she got upset at me and told me to never speak vietnames becaus i cant speak it    wow  i was somewhat shock at the servic  i tri to abid by the sign and lower my standard  

the pho bowl are big  the broth is okay  the noodl are not the typic noodl that you will find at other pho restaur  

i decid to give this place anoth shot  i forgot how hot it was in there  the restaur is big with a weak air condition  there are fan on top of tabl to keep you cool but to make sure your pho stay hot

i took my friend here and she harrass him too  question the way he ate his pho and told him that he shouldnt put chines ketchup hoison becaus it ruin the broth  she also ask him where he usual goe and she mention that her restaur was better she didnt stop to comment onc either she came back everi coupl of minut to see what he thought about the pho after leav i apolog to my friend and said i dont plan on come back 

if you like big portion  they definit have big portion  if you dont care about the kind of noodl this place is ok  if you want to lower your standard in las vega or wherev you are from you can come here and take pictur of the sign and post them on your wall

pho  2 stars
servic  lower the standard to 1
outsid sign arrang and decor 1saw the billboard and decid to go in and tri their pho  my husband and i decid to split a medium bowl of pho spring roll and egg roll and when we order it the ladi which we think is the ownerserv gave us a look like were crazi for share and start comment about asian special vietnames do not share pho and my husband whos white made a funni comment that we would like to share it becaus were not asian  well im filipino 100 and so my husband made that comment to be funni and the server look at me and said oh that whi i marri my white husband becaus im not asian i took this veri offens and then when were done i ask her for a to go box and she again made a sarcast comment abut bring left over home  

veri rude and terribl servic food is noth special for me to come back  i think the owner forgot that there are a lot of vietnames restaur in the valley that shes compet with 

definit a mistak and wast of money tri out this place  i will have to just go back and stick with pho kim longyelp realli need to allow negat ratings


 been there a total of three time now the ladi watiressown from the first time she talk i alreadi knew she was a rude one howev it an asian place so it expect so i ignor her attitud ignor her snidenotsofunni comment and just ate my food becaus that what i went for plus i alway go with a group of 6 or more peopl so i alway have my friend to chat with and make joke with that way her littl sign of lower my standard wont be so annoy 


but our recent trip was by far the worst the worst i dont think ive ever been treat this poor in ani asian restaur and trust me ive been to plenti 


i wasnt realli feel all that well and that whi my friend were will to go to pho instead of the origin plan ramen shop bad idea i think my stomach wouldv prefer the thick ramen soup 


the wait for watersoda 40 minutes
th wait for pho 1 hour and then some


th wait for the food was so long that my stomach had begun hurt befor the food got here and even when the food did get here the food did not help caus the damag was alreadi done so instead of sit back and relax in content of a full stomach i was busi cring in pain who the shit serv pho an hour after the order 

so my boyfriend brought me a bottl of vitamin c tablet for me to take prior to everyth it was a new bottl so all the plastic wrap and cotton insid was put on the tabl caus where els are we go to put it so what did the owner say when she took our orders

clean up your mess please


th fuck ladi you think you wont have to clean up the mess after we eat or what we eat and we clean the tabl for you befor we go the shit


needless to say we didnt tip much and got a sarcast comment from her becaus of it thank for the huge tip your so generous then she repeat it as we were walk out the door whi do i have to tip you if your go to take an hour to bring out pho one hour one hour one hour let me repeat one hour i normal can get in and out of a restaur in one hour not wait for water and food for an hour 


oh the food wasnt anyth that special either


but yeah i suppos you can blame us for not leav asap but i was tri to not to be rude to peopl and in front of my friend normal i dont have a problem with wait caus were in a big group and we alway have a lot to talk about but this was a littl bit too much it was one of those


hey it a lil long but mayb itll be here soon  to
wev alreadi been here this long  might as wellsave your money and hit the wendi next door i certain wish i did

thi place is aw  i rare say that but it realli was  our flight was delay so we decid to hit up sammi for a quick meal  there wasnt ani sign so we seat ourselv  immedi we were approach say that kid cannot sit in the bar area i felt veri far from the bar btw and we had to sit upstair  upstair  a foot away and up a 6 inch step up  um i beg to differ on the stair comment  but whatev we will go with it  

we get seat and order a coupl drink  we werent super hungri so we share the chip with guacamol and a burger with fries

first off the chip were straight up obvious out of a bagand cold and stale  the salsa and guac had to have been from a jar becaus i couldnt imagin them make anyth homemad here both total bland but we ate about half of it  definit a disappoint  the burger was a build your own and we order it with carmel onion 150 and jack chees 150  there was like two string of onion for that price but the burger was ok overal  the fri were cold  the best part was this coleslaw on the side that look like they got it out of the gutter  it was yellowbrownish and liter the serv was the size of a tablespoon  we laugh at how small the serv size wasmayb they didnt want us to get us sick  so gross

th wine and the cant drive 55 drink both 13 were a bit overpr  ya think  i know i knowit airport mark up  what do you expect  i wasnt picki  i was go on a mini vacay

i think the whole time we were there we onli heard one sammi song  i definit will choos somewher els the next time  ive never been disappoint with anyth ive gotten from the airport until now  sammmay  this place is a hot mess  a definit need for some tender love care and some pride in your food

btw i have been to his cabo wabo on the strip and have alway been happi with everyth ive order therebarfwow read the other review guess wait for your food to be serv can be an issu at this restaur  tri wait an hour and 12  other diner were so perturb they left in frustrat the intrepid restaur staff then offer the depart diner plate to those still wait for food  tacki  

bi the time our food was serv my mother inlaw hot beef was cold  they suppos were short 2 cook sinc they had a larg group of women and a red hat societi that seem to get their food in good time mayb the cook walk out midshift  my husband wouldnt let me make a stink but after a wait that long with a hot dish be serv cold there should have been an offer at comp a meal or take a certain percentag off  how on earth doe this place survive

salsa was good shred beef chimi i had was below averag and overfri  at least i know now if ever antiqu in glendal again i can avoid this restaurant

so far the downtown glendal restaur i have tri have been subpar and not worth tri again kimber ann tea shop was the otherthis was not good the scene here was scari at best 

i got fajita how do you mess up fajita mama did it

mi dine partner wasnt all that hungri and sort of sick she got a grill chees how do you mess up grill chees mama did it

it too bad becaus downtown glendal could be cute

i want to like it

bad end of story


upd 91308
i probabl shouldnt admit this but we have taken to call it barfi momma around our hous yes we are badlol i am do a mfg review on denni serious well my ex has tie to this locat so he feed me on his dime this is the spot when i want breakfast for dinner i alway order the same an ultim omelet no mushroom hash brown and a bagel wcream chees um wtf they do not have a denver omelet on the menu who in the world doe not have the capabl to make a denver omelet we are talk ham bell pepper and onion

whi not you may ask well rumor has it that to cut cost they did away with fresh veget such as bell pepper they replac it with a fajita style bell pepper and onion mix which come in frozen they use it for everyth now in 5 or 6 of their menu item so there is no way to make a denver becaus it would tast funki with that crappi season pepper and onion mix frozen 



anyhow i like the free entertain this locat provid the more low end clientel homeless prostitut and idiot and ungrat demand hotel staff manag whom hold their week pow wow here this denni is locat insid of a motel and casino for the record

just get from your car to the build is an erotica of funk alway some prostitut yell at anoth and the women of the night switch shift on the corner

i realli feel good about myself as i am walk into the casino to the insid dennys
i said denni is horribl but not as bad as those call girl just on the other side of the door

th one redeem qualiti in this locat is that they do have awesom music bump everi time i am alway do the booti mix a lot sway in the booth lol i do i realli do then i get hit on by a pimp in which i told to take his babi nut a walkin befor they get let a stompinugh

i usual love the pho saigon 8 on spring mtn becaus they have had consist good servic and food

thi place on the other hand i am high disappoint i had came here befor and i alway wonder whi the seat arrang were so horribl the manag was the person who actual took my order but forgot that i had order it without shrimp so they had to redo my order when it was present i order the hu tieu xao mem thap cam but to my dismay it was just bad it was so greasi that it made me lose my entir appetit and i have had an upset stomach for the whole entir day last time i had order this dish there they went overboard with the garlic the pho and servic is mediocr compar to the spring mtn locat so i just take this as a learn experience

what realli anger me was when my friend went to pay with his card the cashier threw the card back at him instead of hand it to him unbelievable

upd feb 8th 2013

they still suck and the servic has onli worseni love this place so much i forward their 20 off promot for lunch to my whole depart i strong recommend all my friend famili and client this place that whi i have to write this review

i came to this place for happi hour and dinner alway a pleasur especi the dinner on thursday 12262013 the holiday special surf and turf tomahawk ribey and king crab and lemon base season sea bass were phenomenon
  
i therefor took my friend who love fish and seafood here tonight and order the same thing i call befor we arriv to make sure they still serv tomahawk ribey and king crab befor i order i confirm with our server barri for the sea bass barri told us sea bass is alway on the menu

i hate to say that but the fish was chewi and definit not sea bass i show barri the pictur i took last time as i am a yelper and never skip the pictur of good food barri was not attent and told me next time just to show the pictur first and the kitchen will make the same fish  if it a dish alway on the menu whi do the costum need to show the pictur to make sure get the same food and quality

th disast hasnt end the steak was way too raw that we didnt even finish a quarter the king crab were warm in most of part but with dri and frozen part 

our server barri onli had 3 tabl at that time and he spent 98 of his attent on one person of one of these 3 tabl after i reflect him about the fish and show him the pictur and after he wit the untouch steak he just avoid my tabl barri appar doesnt care about the client like the previous server i met here before

th onli right thing for tonight is the food runner rigo who is awesom profession and much more attent than barri rigo greet everi tabl he serv made sure the guest were satisfi and rigo was the onli person who ask us about the untouch steak  thumb up for rigo
  
i am not go back to this place no matter how much i love it when there is no consist of food and welcom servic i have better way to spend my 100  billim honest shock at all the posit review here   came about a year ago and had a good experi and thought id bring the husband and some friend this time    

we sat for twenti five minut with no acknowledg accord to the menu there are new owner messag to the new owner in a half full restaur your size the waitress should be over to greet within two minut   

we stare we wave and got noth  left without even get watersad disappoint to learn that the ownership and manag have chang  we came here from out of town main due to the person and talent in the kitchen that we had enjoy sever time befor  now it over  waitress is the bartend  no menus upon seat  poor servic  i think the owner and staff are polit and enthusiast but it not element anymorthe food was aw i cant believ how bad the bread was how do you serv cold bread of the poorest qualiti at a restaur then you take that same cold poor qualiti bread and grill on both side and put a cheap tomato sauc and chees on it put under open flame in serv it as bruschetta now the bread tast burn i cant believ how bad this place was the jumbalaya was more like a paella that had littl to no flavor and the rice was not cook complet through no wonder they were give away a 25 dollar certif to this place from the radio shop show i willl not return i dont drink alcohol so this was not the place for me i was expect some good food and didnt even come close to get mad i left the restaur still want more to eat becaus i left shrimp on my plate and left two slice of bruschetta becaus it was so unappthe worst most disgust dirtiest third world  botul encrust excus for a burger place in the city

i did not order a human hair ball with my fri but that exact what i got half way through my fri i reach into the boxcupcontain thingand i pull out a roll up ball of hair the worst part isi realli couldnt tell if it came from someon head or somewher else

i can assur you the part of the socal meal that i didnt ingest immedi went straight into the garbag can and the part that i did ingest came out veri soon afterward 

absolut the worst greasi spoon in town i will never set foot in that place or ani other in n out ever againi went to sura tonight  i usual come here everi other week  for the record i am the duke 1 regular here on yelp  ive check in 23 time throughout 23  year  unfortun this will be my last  i bring a lot of friend and famili here and recommend it to everyon  this will also not happen anymor  so what happen  
i was do what i do everi time i come here which was cook kalbi beef on the grill  there seem to have been a veri irrit waiter who did not like the way i was cookng the meat  he told me i cant cut the bone out  i repli with do you want me to eat the bone  he then leav the tabl and say it ok  i proceed to cut the meat the way i want  i basic just cut the bone and chunk of fat out and eat the lean meat  5  minut go by and this overzeal waiter come back and say the owner said i cant cut the meat like that becaus the price of beef is go up and they will charg me extra i person think this waiter guy instig the whole thing and dont think the owner had a problem with anyth   i polit ask him how he would like me to cut the meat and that i have been cut it this way for year  he didnt realli show me how he would have like me to cut it  at this point my buddi got annoy and suggest we just leav  so we did  honest who want some punk waiter hover over you and tell you how to cook your meat  it not even his meat  
i want to add this is the same clown that i dealt with last week that throw the bill on the tabl in the middl of the meal and say there is a shift chang and to pay the bill right then and there  but after further observ my tabl was the onli one that got hit with this shift chang tactic  the other tabl around me didnt get this prematur bill  did he think i was go to run out without pay  veri bizarr individu  
i end up go to via brasil in summerlin where the wait staff was superior to sura  it was like night and day differ  that sura guy with the purpl shirt and the glass need to apolog and offer me a comp for me to come back and lift the boycott  otherwis you will be see a new duke here veri shortid realli been crave fish  chip and was excit to see one right next to the store i was scrapbook at all day on saturday 

first off i was annoy that there was no where insid to sit but they have pretti good mister so ok i stand there look at the menu but have to wait for the worker guy to finish flirt with the girl at the counter befor i can give my order 

i order the combo that contain 1 fish 4 shrimp fri and a drink im sit at the tabl read my book with my earphon in wait for my food becaus they said they would bring it to my tabl so it been a while and i turn around to look back at the place and they are stand in the window with my food boo 

the onli condiment that came with my food were some sauc that was veri thin kinda like a hot sauc but not real hot no condiment anywher els and no one at the window anymor so i sit down to eat these are shrimp realli i couldnt tell with all the bread they tast like noth liter they have no flavor at all the fish was ok but way overcook it was pretti dark the fri were good the onli thing in the meal worth anyth oh and the dr pepper was good but it hard to mess up the nectar of the god 

i end throw away half my food which i never do and if youv seen me you know will not be go back ever except mayb for dr pepperif this establish were locat anywher els it would die the death it so much deserv  we wait for over an hour to be seat onli to be serv the wors bar food we have ever encount it hard to screw up chicken wing but mcfadden did a fine job in do so not onli was the food bad but we were offer plastic dinner ware becaus they ran out of the metal fork and knives
ther are to mani other choic in the area to trystay away from this place at all cost youll be glad you didi went to mcfadden becaus i was stay at the hotel across the street and me and my girlfriend want to go somewher conveni 
when we arriv even though the blackhawk were play the coyotesin chicago in the playoff there were about 13 peopl top in the placewhich seem strang to me
i then notic that there were onli 2 server and a bartend work shouldnt have been too bad given the few peopl in therebut it was
it took 10 min for the server to come to our tabl anoth 15 for her to take our drink order and give us a menu then 20 min to take our order 
onc the food came it was decent but noth special your usual chili applebe or ani other chain restaur fare again noth special

th onli reason i see that peopl would go here is becaus it close to both stadium and in the westgat plaza if you are go there to onli drink fine but dont expect the food to be great or to get ani service

fyi they dont even tri to have an irish theme at this restaur30 min sit at a tabl waitress never show walk out with noth whi doe this place existam i get too old for this

m think not  grant im not the youngest cat in the crowd but i think i deserv some love dont i  well i guess not at mcfadden i might not be that young lad that buy drink for everyon and continu to pound down shot of liquor in the attempt to get myself drunk anymor  howev im the guy that can actual afford it without burn a hole in my wallet  wink  mayb you should be look my way next time instead of continu to serv the drunk dude down the bar who probabl shouldnt be drink anymor unless tent citi is the next destin for him  

loud obnoxi drunk and colleg frat parti like atmospher onli goe so far  let just keep it where it belong becaus i realli dont know if it should be public thing unless it a place call vega  westgat is no vega  

i can parti with the best but even i felt uncomfort here  let just say if a fight broke out i wouldnt be surpris  patio is nice but without a smoke vent is suck  yes i know the patio need a smoke vent  unfortun a bad experi this time well see if i ever return to do a followup  enjoythis place suckssssssss drink are expens and they charg a cover sometim a cover idk if they still but last time i was there they did and i was like wtf onli paid it cuz a few friend were insid alreadi but never again 

servic is horribl and then they allow peopl to danc on the bar which was gross and almost knock over my drink skip this placedepress not a good sign complet dead on a saturday night in the middl of westgat i get that there are a coupl of other choic in westgat but we decid to pop in here big mistak their menu is the typic irish bar fare  greasi and shouldv been perfect after a day of drink unfortun this was not the case all we want were pretzel see they had it on their hh menu we assum we could just order the more expens plate not at the discount hh rate ummm no they wont serv anyth that on their hh menu unless it hh the servic was poormi friend prefer to compar them to a smelli bottom bodi part we ask them what beer they had on tap and were told we have a lot do you want them to name them all huh im sorri that we came into your life and inconvenienc you see that your onli purpos to be in front of us is to serv us and make sure we have a posit experi in your establish clear that was too much to ask for at mcfadden ive never had such a poor experi in my life 

the food was mediocr and the bathroom were disgusting


mayb this space is curs the other place that was here shut down too 

see all the review on here and be at a 15 star should be a sign shut your door and close up all readii am so disappoint  i bought a groupon for this bakeri to buy a half dozen cupcak for my famili becaus i want to support a local busi  when i went in to use the groupon i was told i could not have the 12 dozen list price which would have been fine except i was forc to spend more than 20 to use the deal  i look onlin and found nowher that said this was a requir  i think this bakeri need to be a bit more honest with custom and encourag staff to be kind even to those use a groupon  the servic was terribl  i would not recommend this place to anyonterribl servic tonightrud tri to make us leav earli like 40 minut befor it close  they tri to not give us our buy one get one free  and to top it all offthey put gratuiti on our parti of 5 when it clear state 6 peopl for gratuiti  om call manag and im go to complainwors servic ever they didnt bring all of our order and they tri to bpame everyth on the new guy  we ask if we can split the bill 3 way it was fine but when we had to pay they chang ot to 2 way and that was alreadi wheb we were about to pay  so i dont want to go here anymor  great food terribl terribl terribl servic  on top of that tri to get more money out of you even when the price are post everywher  cheater rude and terriblwell this was an odd experi 

mi girlfriend and i have been want to tri this place for a while we final made it there for a friday dinner upon enter the man made a gestur toward the restaur we walk in but must have still look confus becaus he told us to sit wherev wed like 

i was pretti excit it smell great and we were both veri hungri we took a seat and wait for the servic it never came after about ten minut i walk to the front and grab two togo menus there was a ladi behind the counter but she never acknowledg us we figur the togo menu was pretti similar to the real menu so we took 5 or 10 minut look it over and decid what we would like still no one had acknowledg us at our tabl 

after a while anoth coupl had walk in been given a menu and water my girlfriend suggest we leav but i want to wait around i was more curious than anyth the one waitress took other order refil drink brought out food but we just sat there complet ignor 

the waitress never came and my hunger got the better of my patienc after about a half hour we left i tri to make eye contact with ani employe but they all look away 

we left the restaur laugh at the weirdest dine event we have had in a while 

i guess we wont be go backokay i have not given ani place a one star review in a while and look at some of this restaur friend review i am one of the onli few that has given this place a one star  whi overal feel  a big part of like or love a restaur not just about the food or servic  it the atmospher and how it make you feel  hereit seem out of place  
this restaur is push a concept and atmospher onto downtown phoenix that seem to fit better in scottsdal  here in downtown we are a bit more down to earth we like to feel welcom and comfort when come to a restaurantw dont want to sit upright and nibbl on a 5 chicken wing  and yes it is is wingsingular
with that out of the waylet move on

servic  not ban but not good  the server were not help in describ the dish  especi for a asian fusion restaur this is a must
ambi  the patio look greatth decor was kinda weirdi did not get the music nor the art that was display  it did not fit the concept
drink  i didnt even ordernot interesting

food  i had the duck confit  which i have to say one of the worst i have had  it was so oili and flavorless
spr roll how can anyon over soak rice paper it was so soggi i took one bite and that was it
lop xeong crepe again anoth soggi itemurggh
tonkotsu ramen this was not done correctlyth broth is too richnot in a good way
dessertblueberri mochi with lyche sorbet  now this was great  the textur and sweet good balance

al in all i was realli disappoint with this restaur  i wish the chefown would have stuck to someth more similar to his other success concept which are more in line with his skillsasian fusion i dont think is his nichether are mani asian fusion restaur that have better execution
th mission is one of the best restaur in phoenixthat should have been a model when open a new restaurantthat is what downtown phoenix needit match the name

of all the drunken place i end up at whi couldnt i have been at secret pizza or at least earl of sandwich

way way too mani to deal with this place and horribl manag who think she is work at some fine dine establishment
nop you are in a strip mall sell fri chicken

i got to az often but i will not go back to this place everive driven by daddi mac sever time and wonder what it was about last night it was late i was hungri and decid to stop in

i walk in the door seat myself there didnt seem to be ani waitstaff around and discov that it was comedi night  though i use the term comedi veri loos  

the entertain consist of young africanamerican men yell niggah sht and various other profan as loud and as often as they could

now im no prude i get shock comedi but this was just loud and juvenil the biggest laugh came when he screamed
hey ladi if youv got a clean psi lemm hear ya yell

nobodi yell and that silenc got a laugh
when the silenc is funnier than the comic you know your in trouble

meanwhil nobodi come to take an order and i notic that none of the other tabl have food i guess i could have gone up to the bar to see if they were serv food at a restaur but i was begin to feel like i wasnt go to be there long enough to enjoy it anyway

aft the requisit gay ghetto and prostitut joke   the third entertain came on and start in on a white coupl in the front with hey you white folk you know all about the kkk right i thought

that my cue im outta here

al in all i was probabl there for a halfhour
i never saw a waiter i never had a drink or food
th entertain rang from dull to offensive

needless to say i now know everyth i need to know about daddi mac i wont be backwhere do i begin it suck the old man who own it use to be so good but his kid blow i dont normali yelp but as a chef i have to report the worst 

i went in here order three app super small  and two drink and got charg 3000 buck which normal wouldnt be a problem but for the owner kid text out of uniform at the hostess stand as the boss the bartend argu with the server over my meal about cleanup duti total unprofession as well as get a oyster rockefel with powder hollandais protray as mornay and box frozen spinach total ruin ani food qualiti as well as ambianc they also got the order  wrong when we were the onli coupl in there where is a manag oh yeah text his girlfriend with his sideburn not care about his custom they should be out of busi for charg the price they do for the crap they are serv 
in the end if you have no tast in seafood and want to drop a 10000 bill go there otherwis go to ani chain seafood spot you will do better shame on you seafood market wont be backi was look forward to tri this place sinc i read about it in the 89148 magazin back in februari  i love tapa and the menu look so promisingcarpaccio with truffl oil grill octopus with a red wine reduct and chorizo clam in a white wine broth  my mouth water just think about these dish and mani more on barcelona menu but im sad to report that this was one of the most disappoint restaur ive ever been to

it just so happen that i recent acquir a coupon to this restaur and went to it last friday  i just want to make it clear that i would have happili tri this place at full price and the dish i was look most forward to tri was the carpaccio you just cant go wrong with raw beef and truffl oilid hope  my boyfriend and i were seat and greet prompt  when the server came over to take our drink order he look down at my coupon took it and went straight to the kitchen  be a server for a long time i could tell he was not happi that we brought this coupon but i tri to remedi the situat by be extrem nice  we order the carpaccio pan fri date steam clam diabla shrimp grill octopus sauté tilapia albondiga and merguez  after a short while the tapa start come out and after deliv the first wave our server said im sorri but the carpaccio is veri popular and we are run out of it tonight  i smile and said disappoint oh realli and he respond yes  both my boyfriend and i pick up on his word but we did not confront him about it  it is my strong belief that they had enough carpaccio for at least anoth order but they didnt want to wast it on a tabl with a coupon  as the night progress our server grew increas more impati and annoy with our presenc  when we got our check he had manual written in an 18 tipon a tabl for 2 and i alway automat tip 20 even when the servic is bad  with a coupon or someth comp i usual tip much more becaus that what fellow servic industri worker docan you tell how livid i am  unfortun i wish i could say that onli the servic was sub par but the food rang from ok to not even edible

pan fri date this was the best dish we had from barcelona  the bacon was cook well all of the textur were spot on and they had a nice savori sweet tast  howev the red wine reduct was way too thin the blue chees crumbl were on the stingi side and firefli are much better

steam clam the clam were cook well but the chorizo was veri dri  the broth also need more season this is a common theme

diabla shrimp i like this but again it was not as good as firefli  a nice spici sweet sauc with shrimp but the sauc was a littl too thin

gril octopus this just lack season  the octopus was a pretti good textur not too chewi but the flavor was bland  for good grill octopus tri oliv in the bellagio

saute tilapia complet ined  im not sure if the kitchen just didnt care or if they genuin made a mistak but the outsid of the fish was mushi and the insid was raw  ive never seen fish this textur befor and i honest cant think of how it happened

albondiga meatbal in marinara with melt mozzarella on top  these were so dri we drench each bite in the marinara

merguez a spici lamb sausag serv over roast red pepper couscous  the sausag was dri and not veri spici  the couscous was a littl wet but it had a good flavor

th one good thing about our experi was that the man refil our drink was extrem friend  he never let a drink go empti and explain they have live music some night  i realli wish the food had been better so i could give this place a second chanci quit eat fast food a long time ago  howev i got summon to pick up food from here after go to the gym nearbi i did not get myself anyth im thank that i did not

i was at the drivethrough and after place my order i pull up to get it from the guy at the window who was cough without cover his mouth gross if your serv food and your sick wear a mask cover your mouth when cough then washsanit your hand right after cover your mouth when cough use your upper armshould or dont come to work

if that wasnt bad enough my sister tell me they found hair in one of the burger and a gnat flew from a piec of lettuc they were eat nasty

hop after that incid i wont have to make fastfood stop for other peopl ever againi have heard the say that pizza is like sex even the worst you can have is still not bad hmmm sound like the person that made this up has the palett of a toddler and well 
if i was to find a sexual encount equal to my pizza experi at the sauci tomato i would probabl say it would be the encount that is so bad it make you switch sexual orient 

pizza came in a decent amount of time i suppos i take the box to my kitchen and open the box to expos a flat sloppi pizza fold over on one side to fit in the box sauc was everywher and i was just in awe chicago pizzai not thin it look like the cook had made it from a chef boyard pizza kit so i call and the girl that answer told me that if i want the chicago style pizza i have to specifi that when i order or els it come the way we receiv our well actual she said ummm if you want it like the other way you have to like ask for it it come whatev way you got it then wait did you want it flat and didnt get it orlik thehold onlong ass pausehello wait waitwhat did you order again 
after explain to her that i had order the chicago style initi and receivedsometh els entir she told me that the type of pizza i want would take longer cool whatev i am alway nice and patient when it come to my food and the peopl that handl it i will wait for what i want no problem they deliv it in about 15 minut the deliveri guy demand to see the pizza we did not want he then told us there was noth wrong with the pizza and 99 of them all look like that he was wear an apron and so i am sure he is the one that made it and doe not like critic  how you like me now asshol he said the fact that the pizza need to be fold to fit in the box was like a bonus for us and the sauc splatter all over the crust and pour out the side was also extra lucki for us he was veri aggress and actual made us nervous this creeper know where we live he continu to yell at us about the pizza us be two women with our veri young childrenalso  at the door also get frighten he then left and i was both reliev he was gone and piss i over tip him the first tie he was here we took the pizza to the kitchen open the box and the pizza was not even halfway cookedth dough was almost fulli raw and the chees wasnt even slight brown i put it in the oven realli let the whole situat settl in and decid to not eat the pizza take the 30 loss and eat a bowl of fruit loop 
the fact that order was mess up that happen it is not a big deal the fact that the girl was total unqualifi to answer phone and take order whatev man she is probabl 15 and it her first job so she is fine but the fact that they sent a grown man twice my size to yell in threaten tone at me and my children is so way out of control i wouldnt believ it unless it happen to me i want to call and complain to the store but my friend wouldnt let me as this fuck psycho know were i live and if he couldnt take critic for make a pizza bad imagin critic about person relat issu 
the whole situat gave me an epiphani about deliveri you never know who the fuck is come to your hous until it is too late after this experi i will never ever again order deliveri food to my home no matter how tire hung over late it may be i will either drive my tire ass to the store or onc again go for a bowl of fruit loopsoi figur im go to see what this hippi bag is all about
i get there after breakfastbut befor a full on lunch or brunch crowd
mayb 16 peopl there in various form of order status
som have their foodsom are waitingsom havent decided
ther onli one person ahead of me to order
no big
until i realiz she must be order war and peac word for wordbecaus for whatev reason it was take well over 5 minut for the ladi behind the counter to actual transcrib and place her order
i get readi to leav as anoth staffer pop up to take my order
cheeseburg and fri to go
simple
no question askedmoney has been takenand now i sit and wait
and wait
and wait
and wait
iv look at the decor and the denizen for about 20 minut at this point
at the 25 minut mark they call my name
i get to where i need to be and proceed to partak of this cheddar chees burger and fries
th burger was smother in all sort of crap like saute onionstomato and suchyoud think for all the fanci dress it would have tast like something
anything
nope
it had to be the blandest thing ive ever eaten
i was mystified
how could there be all this crap on this thing and it not tast like anything
th fri were crinkl cut and brought back nightmar of grow up in a household where the crinkl cut fri from a bag were a week menu item
mom never was handi when it came to food preperation
everyth tast like grey matter
so i guess this hippi foray should have not been so alien to me
anyhooit now a day later and it amaz how a burger and fri that tast like noth has been abl to wreak havoc on my digest system
i woke up this morn by my stomach turn and have been releg to the bathroom ever since
it realli nice outsideso onc my bodi is done be realli annoy with me for wait 25 minut for  bland burger that took it reveng on me 16 hour latermayb ill go out to stock up on pepto bismol
sorri two hippies
i want to realli dig your gigbut i cant groov on the movehave met some of the owner befor it open i realli want to love this place the locat is perfect the concept is fun the atmospher is excit and the decor is wonderful

but now that the head chef has gone back to the origin back in california the place is a train wreck

they start off on the wrong foot by send out the worst 12 hurrican ive ever had for a signatur drink i expect someth not a glass of ice with a littl juic and the most unbalanc disgust mix of rum ive ever tasted

th blacken fish sandwich they sent out had raw spot pink squishi a littl cold whoever made it had no idea how to sear a fish

th pull pork was perfect caramel realli just amaz but it was buri under a slaw that may have come from an inspir recip but was atroci execut it was complet ined and it ruin the pork as well

th sweet potato fri were nice to munch on but they were serv with hula sauc which our waiter accur compar to innout special sauc ketchup and mayonnais 

after spend 40 we sent back most of our food and left hungrihow about that after the cashier assur me that my debit card would not be charg twice i find that it did in fact get charg twice post to my account the next day 

i know regist time out ive been there done that i work in retail and it has happen so i know for a fact that it will charg that person twice she didnt offer to call and supervisor or manag but against my better judgment i left 

i file a disput with my bank and hope my money will be return to me in a time manner 

glazier manag ensur that your cashier are proper train to handl all type of situat  and if they cannot give them the tool necessari to ensur that custom satisfact is their top prioriti i chose not to call your establish becaus i felt that if you didnt care if i shop in your store then you wouldnt care if you gave me back my 60 to some 60 is chump chang  but i work hard for my money and 60 is what i could use for gas money and food for my familiim sad that i had a terribl experi here becaus we live in walk distanc and it had the potenti to becom a regular stop for us 

buuuuuuut no i had a live social voucher i think some type of social media discount 

the first problem they had with me was that my voucher wasnt print well on my iphon it clear state either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobil voucher if you are not go to honor mobil voucher then mayb you should put that in the fine print

aft i made it clear they were go to honor this they tri to tell me i couldnt use it for happi hour price now i would definit understand this too had it been written somewher on the voucher nope nowher so our bitchi waitress goe to get her manag becaus clear she doesnt have the brainpow to think of anoth excus for not honor this voucher

so then this braindead manag come over he proceed to tell me that he would be fine with use it for happi hour price but the comput will not allow him to do so i tell him to enter it in to show me that it wont let him  shocker it doe let him

now whi on earth would a place tri so hard to make a custom unhappi becaus to say i left unhappi would be a fricken understat of the year 

dont put out a social media voucher if you are go to be ass when we tri to use itmy fiance and i decied to tri this place out last night around 5306ish we were pleas to find we made it for happi hour one bartend said hello to us and walk away the other bartend didnt even acknowledg us for about 10 minut keep in mind there were 6 peopl at the bar includ the 2 of us and the bar is not big we order beer and he hand us menus we look over the happi hour menu and were think of order someth while look over the menus the bartend was drop f bomb and extremem rude to anoth patron dont get me wrong i drop f bomb quit frequent but never while im work it just bad tastei dont care what kind of job you have  our beer were dri for a long time befor the rude bartend even ask if we want anoth or order food my fiance use the restroom and decied eat here would be a bad idea as they were dirtier than dirti meanwhil a cook came out of the kitchen with food at sat at the bar to eat it the rude bartend yell across the bar to the cook cook cant sit at the bar nate rule  poor guy got up and sat at an empti tabl away from the bar again bad tast at this point we decid we had enough of this place and would not be return ever i am thank we didnt tri the food there are plenti of other dive bar in chandler with good servic and clean restroomweve driven by the phx over easi mani time but i refus to wait for it  i knew in my heart that it wasnt the same type of food worth wait for like matt  we decid to head way out to the appar nonpopular over easi to see what all the fuss was about  to sum it up just dont bother

w walk insid and the place was onli about 12 full so we grab a seat in the middl where there were three terribl place tabl  my first impress was not a good one as this restaur is horribl under util and veri poor plan  the color scheme was nice and cheer though  i realli realli hate the vinyl chair that clung to my leg  it was realli uncomfortable

aft perus the menu for a few moment i decid that the wolf pack was the way to go for me  i like big man breakfast and this sound perfect  two layer of hash brown with bacon and egg cook to order in the middl with chees on top  yum  that realli sound delici to me unfortun it was a big heap pile of fail slop on a plate  the bacon was about the onli good part of my meal  the chees tast like plastic the egg were rubberi and the hash brown were so greasi that they slick my lip with oil after everi bite  in the end despit the fact that i onli ate about 13 of my food i got sick  i was not a happi camper and i will never come backafter get strand in a storm while bike a friend and i end up here as refug until the storm pass we were pretti disappoint on all fronts

th worst aspect was the servic the dine room was about 34 full but our waitress was difficult to find when we were readi to order and when we want the check

th atmospher was also pretti terribl in addit to the tacki decor and awkward floor layout some tabl in the bar area some in the recreat area noth realli align the other patron that were there were loud and rude i guess this is madison version of a dive bar

th food had no redeem qualiti my friend got the 9 caesar salad which consist of a minim amount of romain lettuc and caesar dress not even crouton for 9 i expect at least some veggi or top on the salad note that for 3 more you can get chicken on top but i wouldnt hold my breath

i got sweet potato fri which were ok but were clear frozen

avoid at all cost unless this place clean up their actmayb i came on an off day mayb my expect are a littl too high as of late but serious how doe this place have this volum of rate and maintain this high of an average
im not sure if im more piss at the restaur for be subpar or this mani yelper be fool by such simpl bullshit it my fault for be on my die cell phone and not take the time to read the review otherwis i would have dismiss this place immedi when i realiz  multipl salsa was the consist 5 star standard for a qualiti establish  are you frickin kid me

food  ill tri to take my shitti experi out of this equat for the moment and ask whi peopl love this bland cooki cutter on the boarder franchiseesq no heart soulless food after final be abl to put in the order after 20 min wait we wait anoth 20 min i know becaus i time it to get a cold to semiwarm plate the carnita was over cook tough that a huge accomplish if you know how to make it and bland had a nice piec of bone in there too the bean had that nice dri crust layer on top like it had been sit under the heat lamp a littl too long but was too far to get the heat 
that salsa everyon lose their shit over was okay el torrito and on the boarder has that too so doe rubio technic 

servic this was just stupid and im kick myself for not walk out went on a late sunday afternoon after hike mt charleston needless to say hungri the place is hard busi one girl come over to take drink order say she cant take beer order but the the bartend can who will also be our waitress i dont know whi she couldnt have given our order to the bartend when she inform her of our tabl 10 min later bartend come natali you want someth from the bar place drink order ive been watch her from my tabl 15 ft away flirt with some douch face at the bar beer come out in a glass so cold the beer is slushi im not onli a pretenti dick im also a beer snob i like to tast my beer frozen glass  no tast in spite of my annoy i ask nice if i can have a glass that isnt ice natali they all come like that  me how about that soda glass that isnt frozen or run one under some cold water 10 min pass flirt with douch come back replac beer in differ frozen glass now take food order

i went to vega this weekend to enjoy ufc 106 with some close friend after forrest griffin made me happi i decid to top off the even with someth like the boil crab or the crab hut i use my friend iphon to find the nearest spot for us to indulg in some cajun good we got in a cab and hurri over to cajun crawfish we arriv to find the place almost empti we were sat and the waiter return with our drink we order our usual and wait for about 15 minut onli to have the waiter return to our tabl to tell us they were out of corn on the cobwhaaaat ok ok oki can deal with that but then we wait about anoth 30 minut onli to be confront with the most flavorless crawfish and shrimp i have ever tast in my life our potato come and they have no season anywher and are waaay undercook we sent the potato back to be cook longer and they were still under cook when the waiter brought them back we order some steam white rice and even that was horriblehow do you screw up rice the sausag was undercook the crawfish was over cook and lack ani flavor except spice the shrimp was ok at besta tad over cook but stillok we tri to tell the femal waitress about the potato and the rice onli to find she doesnt speak english so we were then stuck play charad with the girl after we were finish with our disast of a dinnerw ask for wet nap the lemon scent one tend to cut the fishi smell out of your hand guess what no wet nap 

we agre to call it quit for the even and head back to the hotel we ask the waiter to call a cabaft ask everi employe in the joint do we have cab number we decid to make use of the iphon onc again and call our own cab 

we wait outsid for our cab and notic the sign for cajun crawfish state grand open well i dont know about grand but i guess the place is new so here is my advic to the ownersshut down for a week and visit the boil crab in la area notic the flavor the decor the hospit servic the flavor and the flavor or their food then come back to vega and regroup there is no point in own a below averag establish like this when you have visitor that know what their food is suppos to tast like and visit your restaur with certain expectationsthey are just go to leav serious unhappi and are go to tell all their friend about their piss poor experi not tri to be meanbut cajun crawfish is way under par 

cajun crawfish fail to deliverin everi way possibl i will not go back and i will make sure that no one i care about make the same mistak i did by go here wast of time wast of money and there was a risk of food poison with the whole undercook sausag thing it clear this place doesnt care about the qualiti of their foodlook like they are just happi enough to be open and have anyon walk through their door 

2 lb shrimp 1 mild and 1 medium fail 
2 lb crawfish medium fail

i would have been happier with popey chicken and biscuiti tri this place for three reason 1  ive been search for a better chines food restaur than where we go now 2 sever week ago someon drop off a menu at our hous 3 decid to tri someth new 

deliveri took onli 25 minutet and the food arriv veri hot 

mi wife order the beef with broccoli i order the shrimp with lobster sauc my wife took one bite and said the beef was tough and the broccoli was hard it wasnt coook enough she also said her dish smelt weird at that point i dug into my shrimp  lobster sauc it was more like egg drop soup than ani shrimp and lobster sauc dish i have ever tri anywher i also paid extra and got fri rice instead of white rice it was so bland it was ined everyth went  immedi in the trash

w  also order  wor wonton soup and got a free entre which we were plan on have for lunch or dinner tomorrow sinc we put the entre in the trash nd were hungri we decid to give the soup a tri there was larg chunk of pork in the soup which look good but after tri a piec i was sure that was not how the meat was suppos to tast my wife agre and we end pour it down the drain we then tri the free almond chicken entre  again the dish was noth short of  disgust so it went direct into the trash as well

food want to realli enjoy it but honest the food was detest we both  near gag just after tast it to say our food was dissatisfactori is an understat stay away price wasnt worth the price even if it was free servic fast deliveri  conclus  i have rare been this disappoint with a restaur  if i could give this place 0 star i would this is the worst chines restaur ever



dinn cost 2837 and it all went down the drain or in the trash i will never order from this establish again stay awaythe compound
thi venu doe not honor their contract with artist that perform at the premisesdo not play this event unless you are prepar to receiv a bs stori about whi they wont pay there contractu oblig despit your band pack the hous with at least 250 peopl their music director kyle day is a liar cheat and particip in uneth busi practicesakaarseholi decid to take my wife to cabowabolv for an earli valentin dinner sinc she is the biggest sammyhagar fan  has been die to check this place out sinc it open 

befor go i did my homework and read all the review that had been post after read i was realli surpris this place is still open not too mani good thing be said 

we arriv on friday night around 10pm and the hous band had just start play acoust soulla vega origin  onli live jukebox they play all requestssom good some not so good 

we were seat immedi with no wait even though the place was pack includ the outdoor patio bar 

the menu is mexican food with a baja twist veri pricey we order beef fajita nacho to startth carn asada entre  a 3 item combo with hard  soft shell taco and a chees enchilada ice water all around no drink this time 

howev they did pour free shot of tequila when the band play mas tequila 

the servic was a littl slow it took near 30 minut befor we saw the appet and we spent most of the night chew on ice 

the nacho were veri underwhelming1012 soggi chip cover in cheap shred chees and spars bit of beef fajita meat 4 melonbal size scoop of lettucepicosour cream  guac no season no spice no flavor just chees the complimentari chip  salsa are a much better choic 

next the entre came out the carn asada plate cover wchees onion and jalapeno a coupl tortilla and a plate with lettucepicosour cream  guac no salsa again with the cheap shred chees and the jalapeno were not even cook just slice and cover in chees 

the fajita onion  pepper were way too much compar to the skimpi 8oz carn asada steak the steak like the nacho had no season or flavor for 20 at a bar i was realli expect someth phenomen 

the 3 item combo of beef taco and chees enchilada was alright except for the chees enchilada which again use the cheap shred chees which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless 


the lack of season for a mexican resataur is realli unaccept and no salsa with entre no bean with the chip appet  


for 2 peopl to have an appet and 2 entreesdrink ice water and get slow servic for 65 pretti disappoint to say the leastif i could rate cabo wabo a negat score i would 

we arriv just in time for karaok which i would give 5 star  but that where the good end 

we were not actual sat by the hostess just point toward the tabl no menus so im assum the frat boy waiter assum we didnt want servic when i ask for menus he look at me like i was nut then 5 second after get the menus he ask us so are you gonna order someth really

h never ask us if want drink i went up to the bar to get mine for a weak 8 oz margarita it was twenti dollar for a premad slurpe with hous alcohol   

i would never go back there again they treat us like trash and we did noth to deserv it 

and to top it off i accident left an expens souvenir behind when i return they didnt have a lost n found they said we just throw it away i tri to express the whole experi to the manag his respons was oh well

so this last time i actual got to eat there we sat down and order our food i pull out my babi food and bottl so i could feed him  the owner came back like serious 5 separ time to tell us how inconveni it was that we brought a babi to his place

th first time he look at me with a serious face and ask doe your babi like drop food all over the floor and i was just so shock i said yes he might a littl  i mean im definit not one of those mom who leav a mess on the floor i liter clean up the floor befor i leav anyway so he come back again after 5 min and say that i cant serv ani outsid food in the restaur  so i ask if he was talk about my homemad babi food and he said yes you are not allow to bring food for your babi becaus it is against the law um ive been to mani place in madison and given homemad babi food to my son and ive never been told this comment  so i ask him then i cant give him formula either and he said no so i said then how can i feed my babi and he say that whi it difficult to travel with a babi 

and he said all this with a straight face i will never be go back to k pepper they are racist against korean i am korean and outright rude 

ps i am korean and the korean fusion food there is ok not the bestwhat a disast  i dont get the love of this place at all  ill agre with patrick l on this one williamsonoma with a hot case  that all this is  where do i begin

first  the layout  this design might be nice when one or two peopl is in the store but on a saturday afternoon this place had 30 peopl in it and was insan  the layout doe not help  not onli are there three set of line that merg into each other creat all sort of pileup but there is no where to go that you arent in the way  rack of food act as line partit more than they act as display case  it is realli a nightmare

second  qualiti for the price  it is a ton of highend stuff and that okay  i have no issu with high end product but  where the hell do you get off charg 5 more than some place like delici dish  i can get the same product at a local own store for signific less  there is noth special about what you stock  you dont make these chees yourself  these arent your livestock be slaughter  you get this stuff from the same supplier that aj trader joe and petit fromag do yet you charg like your the onli game in town

fin  you call that a deli counter  the girl work here have probabl been use a meat slicer for 2 month and couldnt tell you the differ between mortadella and sopressata  im sure they dont know how to cook it and can guarante that they dont know proper pairings

no thank  ill stick with delici dish in phoenix and keep my money localdoesnt even deserv 1 star  my husband and i went here last night to grab dinner befor a concert at the mesa art center  we arriv at 6 and the show start at 730  the hostess ask if we were go to the show and we said yes we were seat immediatelyth place was not even half full  wait a good amount of time befor our server came to the tabl to take drink order  wait 20 minut for 2 glass of wine  order our food which consist of a salad grill flatbread and a burger with fri  the salad came after we had been there for about 45 minut  final realiz it was 700 and still didnt have our food  ask our server about the delay and she seem shock  to top it off she had the nerv to say i brought you some bread your salad and winewhat  we told her never mind on the food we would just take our bill  by now it 705  the manag come to the tabl to tell us that our food is be plate right now so it readi  at this point the show was start in 20 minut so we clear didnt have time to eat it now  she was veri unapologet about the whole situat  she brought us our bill and clear couldnt be bother to comp anyth from it to tri and rectifi the situat  then the server come back again to tell us our food is done now and did we want to take it was us  whi yes i would love to take my food and leav it in the car for the next 25 hour while we attend the concert  that sound like a great plannot   the coupl that was seat right befor us had also complain to their server and manag about the wait and i overheard their server mention that is was becaus there were so mani peopl here tonightkeep in mind i mention the place was bare half full  that was their 3rd time come to the restaur and it was the same all 3 time  they were realli tri to give the place a chanc but said 3 strike and you are out  such a disappoint and unlik the other coupl we will not give them anoth chanc  when you have peopl complain you have to make it right and they did noth do not wast your time go here unless you have ton of time to kill  luckili the show at the theater was amaz so it didnt ruin my night sinc we had to go to the show on an empti stomachthe wine was great the bar was super cute and the patio was awesome

our servic was noth short of horrend our waitress would rare come check on us and when she did she would walk away befor we had a chanc to speak we ask for a bottl of wine then brought us glass after remind her that we want the bottl she was reluct to come up with a solut to her mistak her initi respons was someth to the effect of i just fill the glass you drank out of so i cant take them back after discuss it she told us that she would comp four glass of wine and charg for the bottl seem fair to us so we were more than happi to work with her

then came the check overcharg us and overcharg our friend when i brought it to her attent she got extrem snippi and told us that she had said she would comp our next four glass of wine sinc we onli had three glass each the two we order initi then the two we had that were suppos to be the bottl rather than the four each she claim it didnt exact make sens there was no attempt to recov from her aw servic all she did was argu with us while the manag sat and watch 

id love to tri 5th and wine on a differ night but if this server come near our tabl im outbeso off  is the best way to put it a restaur that need to be shutter  and in a citi where there are mani other choic most like will not continu to surviv as the place doe not seem to realli care about the issu with the restaurant

and cheap food   as in qualiti not price or the head chef is just way too enamor with salt which is usual use to hide the cheap flavor of subpar steak especi the way that they slather it on everything

so this is a cluster beyond cluster we came here for a busi dinner becaus the los angel locat has good review big mistake

th wait etc was not bad we made a reserv they sat us when we had more than 50 percent of our parti there the wait staff  craig and angi  were super nice veri charm and had more common sens than the assist manag on duti chad jahn yep total use the full name

so let start with the cluster

a fire in the kitchen greas fire that made the whole place smoki the grill is right there so you can see them cook steak big whoop sorta cool but obvious too small for a restaur of the size and appar the back kitchen is just as bad

b our saladssoup come out fine  noth spectacular but not terribl  and then we wait for the steak and wait and wait oh by the way it onli 830 when we sit down but theyr alreadi out of the bonein filet which the waiter talk up how do you run out of a steak by 830 pm kitchen incompetence

c were still wait for our steak it a good 45 minut postfinish our salad and appet were still wait and still waiting

d angi and craig are proactiv and good wait staff they come up to us and apolog about the wait it not their fault  the kitchen is run by incompet but they do their job and do it well 

e the steak come out  medium rare not the medium that was order but the medium rare we send them back and one come back  char on the outsid but still raremedium rare hes too nice to send it back and the issu is that the kitchen is back up so just send out steak good way to settl a problem with an incompet kitchen staff send out undercook meat and hope they dont send it back to caus more setback in the kitchen idiots

f i ask for the manag  the man with no freakin sens to come to our tabl this would be chad jahn who look like a former bouncer that has been elev to restaur manger demot him back to bouncer that what he seem hed be good at we talk to him tell him the issu  and he never check up on us again good manag skill asshat oh and he doesnt acknowledg our issu when we leav he did take care of the bill but i think he had to be told to do that i told him were get free dessert 

g i got churro i like churro the churro at costco are better than beso um useless kitchen staff churro are serv hot 

h so while walk outsid with the colleagu for her to smoke we pass by former colleagu and they ask how it went we told them it suck to leav there was this longhair guy listen to us id notic him for a bit walk around so i said are you one of the owner and he said no hes just wait for a friend um found out he is one of the owner if as an owner you cannot take respons for your poor servic and food the restaur as a whole are doom nice sidestep and not take ownership longhair 80s rocker look dude his or chad solut to the fire and the wait was to offer free sangria thank and those that dont drink thank you also idiots

i like i note the food was salti the steak had a salt layer that should not be necessari if they are realli harri ranch the string bean mushroom and other veget were slather with salt as well salt is a lazi addit for poor qualiti and tast food draw your own conclus here 

we got out of there 3 12 hour later when it should have been 1 12 hour dinner it not becaus we were social but becaus it was just wait and wait and wait and then send back food and wait the place is a train wreck rap up in hipster cloth well like most thing hipster and the manag and owner seem unabl to manag or take ownership of the problem and issu good riddanc for when it shut down the chef should not be a head chef but our wait staff rock and should be at a better place

eva longoria parker should be asham her name is associ with this place but it might not be that long befor other forc it out i heard mastro is open in vegas

upd yay  a fake review post by an employe or pr person for the restaur thank megani went to beso for my friend bachelorett parti with a group of ladi and we were told that dinner was complimentari and all we had to do is to leav tip for the server which was 10person  i thought it was realli nice of them to comp our dinner especi with 9 ladi all together

it all began with champagn  when the first server veri nice start to serv champagn to us she had run out of it after 3 glass  she then open anoth bottl and continu pour  anoth femal server rush over and ask whi did you open anoth bottl for them and then whisper someth to the first server

5 minut later anoth server came to us and told us that our dinner includ appet toss salad steak and a bed of mash potato which sound amaz right not even close

w got  2 tini serv of guacamol with a veri light portion of tortilla chip and i think the chef forgot to season it with you know salt onion and whatev recip it call for  0 star

th steak was a joke  it had no flavor overcook and lukewarm  there were liter 8 precut piec of steak for 9 peopl with a bed of mash potato  the mash potato was the best part of the meal but then again all of us share a one person meal  

i would have been fine to pay the 10 tip if the servic was good but we had to call 4 differ server to get some ice water after we had alreadi wait 10 minut  so we paid 90 for this crappi meal  was it worth it  id rather give a homeless guy my 10 then spend it at besothis place has gone off the deep end  it use to be my favorit steakhous in all of lv but it has gone so far downhil ill never eat here again

it was our server first day and im more than will to cut a new server some slack but what happen was ridiculous

for entre i order the filet which was cook well but tast nowher near what their steak tast like 2 year ago when i frequent ate there  

i ask the waiter to add a lobster tail to the steak

when the food came out the waiter brought our steak and a whole lobster  i ask anoth server to get our becaus we order a tail and not the whole lobster

about 5 minut later our server came over and tri to tell me that what was on the tabl was a lobster tail 

funni  ive never seen a lobster tail with claw leg and a bodi before

mi friend and i were alreadi into our steak when he took the whole lobster away and said he would look into it

15 min later he come back  still no lobster tail and i was almost done with my steak and we were in a rush so i told him to just forget the tail if it was gonna take longer

then he disappear for anoth 15 min  i ask anoth server to pleas grab him and he came out and i ask for the check

anoth 10 minut goe by and so we walk in to see if the check was readi and what was take so long we ate outside

th manag was adjust the bill  and this is what realli piss me off

th manag say sinc you order the whole lobster and then cancel it and then order the tail and then cancel it im charg you for the tail

i said  no  i order just a tail to begin with  

he say no you didnt my server told me you order the whole lobster  i trust my server

and want to stand there and argu with me about it tell me i was lie about order just the lobster tail

i told him i was almost done with my meal and the tail still wasnt there which was whi i cancel it

h didnt want to hear ani of it and got a realli smug attitud with me

at no other nice restaur on the vega  strip will you see this sort of treatment of a custom  he stood there blatant call me a liar right to my face when both my friend and i tri to tell him the server was the one who fuck up  not me

thi place went from penthous to outhous  from the manag to the wait staff to the food

 ill never eat here againdure my recent trip to vega over the christma holiday my best friend and i decid to visit the mandarin orient tea loung for a relax late afternoon away from the fanni pack and liquor slushi 

ill start with the good
th hotel itself is veri chic as is the tea loung beauti asian decor with a view of the strip you could find on a postcard in a hotel gift shop a clean and upscal environ but without a pretenti air that frequent accompani high tea  the hostess were eleg dress and had us seat almost instantly

in term of food i was impress with the spread the scone were delici especi when accompani by strawberri rhubarb compot and clot cream the select of tea was love my favorit be the matcha 

now the bad
th sandwich select they offer includ a curri chicken salad which contain nut howev nowher on the menu did it specifi the use of nut in ani of the offer the waitress also gave an extrem detail run down of the type of sandwich scone top and dessert yet fail to mention nut be in ani of the food asid from a pistachio cake for the record i am death allerg to peanut and cashew to the point that i carri around multipl epi pen in my purs everywher i go 

when i bit into the sandwich i start to feel sick and i took a closer look onli to see a small piec of nut that i couldnt identifi off the bat when i flag down a waitress to ask about what kind of nut were in the item she panick and left to ask the chef when she return she kept firm insist that i was fine becaus it was just walnut but anyon who know anyth about nut know that almost all tree nut are process in the same facil when i tri to ask about nut be in ani of the other dessert she act annoy to be bother by me again 

i was appal by how it was handl and i felt ill for the remaind of the day becaus of that one bite of sandwich i was almost offend to see that they automat includ 18 gratuiti to the bill becaus i would have left 0 if given the opportunity

i admit it was irrespons on my part not to ask but the waitress had given such a precis account of ingredi use in other item ie eggnog truffl bubblegum flavor french macaron black forest ham sandwich etc that i thought i was in the clear i suppos it was my error to expect such a high regard establish would care about their custom dietari restrict 

i realli realli realli dont enjoy write bad review as you can tell from my profil but it necessari in this case to warn other peopl with sever nut allergi im lucki that all i left with was a bad stomach ach i realli hope in the futur the mandarin tea loung is more consequ of their patron needwe had our credit card info stolen from this place  beware
w ate lunch here one afternoon about a month ago  my partner use his busi card as it was a busi lunch  hasnt use this card in 6 month  well one of the ton of differ staff that serv us is a thief and skim the card and secur code  two week later someon in new york is tri to use a perfect replica of the card to make purchas at gas station and food  our credit card compani caught if quick as we have zero connect to new york  bewar they hire a roach of a person  the nacho are not worth it  i contact a manag but for all i know hes in on the scam  it was absolut this placeit like my food was cook then marin in methane

substandarddestroy the mad onion what happen to dan marino he ditch this place and turn it into a whack sack of chicken wing that shrunk the best part about the reason whi it even has 2 star is that the wing are still 25 cent they should charg 15 cent for how small the wing shrunk

quick tip order the wing nake and ask for sauc on the side they come out super soggi and oili beyond the bp accid out in the ocean

anoth thing that destroy what made this an awesom late night spot is the ranch swap what give with that i mean what restaur even carri individu ranch dress bucket and on top of that charg you for it ridicul whoever kidnap mr marino and place mr onion in his restaur need to be found and punish for this heinous abomin i mean come on your in a hooter hotel for god sake repres the legendari wing chain

th onli reason whi i would ever go back to the mad onion is when they bring mr marino the larg wing and ranch free of charg or if my friend forc me and play the your my friend and you have to support me in come to the mad onion becaus i love this place card

upd correct the wing are no longer 25 cent theyr 795 for 10 wing and fri star removhow stuck up can you be i came here for a meet with a student and held off on get tea for a while about 20 minut in a waitress rude interrupt me as im explain someth and say in the most arrog tone  are you go to get some tea or not becaus just sit here is not okay i look around there were at least 5 open tables

now i knew i was go to get some tea becaus i had a long day ahead and not a lot of sleep to keep me go i would rather have gotten it after i finish work but that certain not happen when you treat me like a vagrant nor do you deserv my explan i went to steep and brew and got myself a drink there instead and ill be sure to let everyon i know know that they should do the samei went to down under the other night with my boyfriend for our date night weve work in the servic industri for year so we hold the bar pretti high on food and servic we order a chees plate the barramundi and some wine

when the chees plate came out i almost laugh everyth on there that wasnt chees clear came from a can and the chees look like the one you can buy precut from frys or wherev frys chees plate may actual be a cut abov what we received

aft the blasphemi that was our chees plate we were both a littl nervous to see the barramundi barramundi is suppos to be a tender flaki white fish what we got was a sad piec of ocean chum that look like it came out of a microwav to say it was bad isnt say enough it was total devoid of textur and taste

to round out the even our wine and the select of wine were mediocr at best and the servic was not worth mentioning

al in all this was the most disappoint dine experi and wast of 75 that ive ever spent sinc move to arizonaif you ever go to the wonder bar take my advic and pay in cash 

five of us went there for dinner last tuesday we were 3 minut late get there and they prompt gave our tabl away so we patient wait about 45 minut for anoth tabl 

the food was good we all had the petit filet it was a good valu at 26 mine came with a somewhat wilt and small salad and a side my total bill was 40 includ a glass of wine and tip the waitress was veri nice and offer to split up the bill for us and we all paid our share about 40 each and went on our way 

three day later i check my credit card activ to find a 169 charg on it from the wonder bar aka coliseum bar i alert my friend who told me they had alreadi been charg the correct amount on their card i contact the wonder bar and rick the manag doubl check and inform me they had put the entir bill on my credit card and that they would correct it on my card and charg the other in my parti i inform him my friend had alreadi been charg their correct share he appar didnt listen bc today sever of them were charg again 

so what had been a seminic experi has turn into a huge headach this was an aw custom experi and i dont think ani of have receiv an apolog for all these error there goe your posit review recommend and ani repeat busi from uswell this is it mellow mushroom i am break up with you for whatev reason we just cant seem to hit it off we start eat in the happi valley locat but after a long string of back luck we decid to tri the take out route

on one occas eat in our server went home after take our order and never brought our food on anoth we wait over an hour after take our order to get our pizza but when it arriv it was burnt to a crisp and had the wrong top on sever occas we were seat and it took 20 minut for someon to even acknowledg us call it bad luck or whatev but dine in has never realli work out for whatev reason

sigh but now take out isnt even work out weve had two incid of drive to the restaur at the time we were told to pick up our order and then we had to wait anoth 20 minut becaus it wasnt readi and on top of that our order are consist come out wrong  and for the price im pay i deserv better 

origin what i like about mellow mushroom was that it was a littl bit differ than other pizza place uniqu pizza and sandwich sort of on the expens side but a nice chang of pace not outstand but differ 

gener i have a problem with the servic ive probabl visit this locat about ten time and as a former server myself i have to admit ive never been to a restaur in recent memori where the staff is so unprepar or uninterest in what theyr do from greeter who dont greet to server who disappear to food that arriv late and often wrong to get the wrong check from a tabl of 8 there were three of us at lunch  weve just had so much bad luck with this place

work in a restaur for year i know that thing happen and im will to forgiv and forget and for mellow mushroom that doesnt seem to matter much on the last incid where we got the wrong order no one even apolog i can forgiv mediocr food if the servic is excel but after so mani chanc the onli consist ive found here is frustrat i tri i realli tri but we have to break up i need to find someon who appreci me as a custom 

if you are interest in the glutenfre pizza or if you enjoy a nice select of beer mellow mushroom is probabl a good option but at this price rang there are a lot of better option closebi that are less frustrat i realli dont like leav negat review the last restaur i wrote one for is now out of busi but i hope mellow mushroom can improv and give other a better experii was furious the last time we ate here with famili we had a parti of four and there was a short wait so we got a buzzer after more than half an hour of stand around and see at least four group come after us and be seat we went to the hostess stand where three bare teenag girl stood around laugh and chat to each other we ask how much longer we would be wait and one of them start to look at the list and couldnt find the name we actual had to point it out to her even though it was right in front of her face then she look at us and gasp and said she accident cross it off and pass over us how do you cross off a name by accid you take someon to their tabl and cross of the name onc they are sat you dont cross it off by mistak the three of them just stood there smile innoc and didnt apolog at all

 so we were stand around for god know how long becaus those three girl are obvious too young to know how to do one of the easiest job correct even with their three brain put togeth i was with some peopl that i respect and did not want to caus a scene but if they werent there i would have demand to see someon befor even be seat at our tabl just unacceptable

manag pleas make sure this never happen againjust went there for breakfast it was a complet disast 

we wait in line for 5 minut for the hostess to take our name and then wait 15 minut after that to be seat this was a littl frustrat sinc we could see there were open tabl 

onc we were sat on the patio the waitress took our drink order and didnt come back to take our food order for about 15 minut she seem annoy and indifferent

w wait forev for our food peopl around us were clear as displeas as we were the waitress never came over to refil our drink or offer ani explan for the wait it was almost as if she was avoid us we just sat and wait get more annoy everi minut we watch as tabl of custom sat with no food and the staff mill around no pep in their step no sens of urgenc they all seem like they realli could not care less about their job and their tip 

when we final got our food it was noth impress we basic got an 8 slice of bread with some ham and chees on it noth anyon couldnt make at home never got a refil on our drink food was edibl but i wouldnt call it good 

the waitress explain after i ask whi it took so long that 3 peopl in the kitchen had walk out so that whi she was frustrat she was frustrat i couldnt believ she had the nerv to say that when she wasnt do anyth to make up for it i would respect them if they look like they were tri but they realli werent 

there was no sign of a manag or owner it look like a bunch of sloppi apathet kid with no guidanc work there if your kitchen staff walk out that a clear indic of a problem 

it too bad becaus the ambianc is cute and hip and this area could realli use a privat own spot for breakfast but all in all i would say do not wast your time and money on this poor manag joint we wont be backthe sugar factori is known for it delici drink and some of the worst servic in town

seri ive had a problem with the sugar factori on the strip with custom servic and after visit this locat for the first time the other day my hope of better servic crumbl it even wors here

whil the hostess was great and quick about seat us we sat there for about 12 minut befor anyon even came over not onli was the waitress slow she seem confus as to what tabl she was suppos to be wait a moment after she left anoth waiter came to take our order onc again and was confus that we had order with someon els already

i usual get the veggi burger from sugar factori not onli is it realli the onli accept vegetarian dish on the menu it just delici i dont know whether they chang the recip or the chef is an idiot but the onc signatur purpl bun was replac with a regular white bun bummer 

finish touch to our horribl experi the bartend that brought us our drink was a complet bitch we sat by the bar so i could see what they were do she was chat with anoth bartend and seem irrit that she had to work you know do her job and make drink when she brought over the drink you could tell she was in such a pissi mood becaus she couldnt concentr enough to hold the drink steadi she spill a good portion of mine all over her hand and slam the drink on the tabl further spill my cherri pop drink so now i have a drink with 12 of it spill all over the tabl and she stomp off without an apolog or clean up her mess 

also stick the cherri tootsi pop in the drink is a great idea and all but it would be better if they took the wrapper off and put the sucker in handleupmor pleasant to hold and no one has to peel the wet paper off the candi 

as good as their sugari sweet are the servic and price are enough to sour our mood stay away farrrr awayyyyyyyummwtf

cam here to grab some food and a drink first of all the place was dead and the decorvis of the place seem all over the place but whatev we seat ourselves

aft about 15 minut the server come over and ask what we want to drink and then toss some menus on the tabl while say sorri guy we just open we dont have a fuck clue what go on fine beer arriv the menu did not look impress at all i order fri and gravi not much you can mess up there right wrong how about saltless stale fri and gravi that tast as if it crawl out of a can

but this get better
serv omg did you guy see that guy
m what guy
serv the one that was just arrest outside
m excus me
serv oh yeah it was crazyh walk in here with his peni hang out
m what
serv yeah it was just hang out
m ummmcheck please

bad food overpr beer and crazi no thankwent back today as i feel everi place deserv a second chanc i was again irrit that the smallest sub i could order was an 8  also i verifi on the vito there is no mention of mayo on the menu   it state it is serv with italian vinaigrett i made sure to mention it to the girl behind the counter and she told me they put mayo on all their sub i will not be backif i could give this a negat 5 star i wouldworst dine experi so far in las vega i went there last night with 2 friend and order a steak i got the steak which was ihop qualiti and it had 2 piec of plastic cook into it they were not small piec they were the size of silver dollar i show the waiter and he said that is from the plastic wrap we cut the meat out of this was the same kind of steak that denni and ihop use well he ask me if i want a new steak and i joke said yes but no plastic pleas and laugh he then rude repli yeah that common sens dont you think and walk away my friend and i look at each other and were shock and ask if we had heard him correct i got up and went to ask the hostess if the manag was there and if i could speak to them about my waiter the hostess inform me that my waiter was the owner the waiterown then came up behind the hostess and confront me about me tri to make a complaint i told him i didnt like how he talk to me at my tabl and that he then repli then get the explat out of my restaur i said get out you and your friend too i stood there stun and actual laugh in his face that made him angri so he call over 2 goon from the dine room to tri to muscl me out one guy walk up and take off his suit jacket like he is go to assault me not cool at all  this be my first time in this restaur will also be my last the servic was atroci and the food was ihop qualiti for strip price and then to add insult to injuri they still made us pay for our mealive been a las vega local for 35 year i rare go to the strip and now i rememb why

w polit declin the server offer for anoth round of drink at which time she told us that if we didnt spend anoth 10 per person we would have to leave

i was ok with the fact that they had a 10 per person  per hour beverag minimum i wasnt ok with the waitress tell me 3minut after i paid my bill youv alreadi paid so you cant just sit herew have peopl wait for tabl i was complet stun we had not even finish our drink for the record there was no one wait in line

a for the food mediocr at best as for the servic josi gs face might have crack if she smile 

this is an overflow restaur a place where diner go to eat when there are no other restaurantsseat avail my suggest if the skybox is the onli seat in the hous wait until anoth seat openshula tri to combin upscal steakhous with footbal to disastr though frequent hilari results

they take you on a tour befor seat you show you a replica lombardi trophi and tell you all about the 72 dolphin undef season i found it especi hyster the hostess took extra care to point out this trophi is a replica you mean the real lombardi trophi isnt kept at a steakhous insid a shitti indian casino in chandler az shock equal entertain was how the hostess kept drone on about the 72 dolphin long after we made it clear we didnt care um ladi it just me and 2 femal cowork were all hungri and none of us give a shit about the 72 dolphin appar we were also suppos to be impress by the blackandwhit pictur of the 72 dolphin on the wall oooh blackandwhit pictur how artsi someon took a coupl photographi class at communiti college

aft conclud that fascin tour we were final taken to our tabl we were all exchang that was weird look when the waitress hand us our drink menus and explain the steak menu was paint on the footbal she was carri i know what your think and the answer is yes it was a regul size footbal and yes it was hand paint she made sure to mention this last fact twice i mean what kind of upscal steakhous would it be if it steak menu was paint on a footbal by a machin pish posh

anyway that when thing went from amus to i will never set foot in this restaur again the hostess put the footbal on a tee and set it down right on my cowork plate gross i wish i had taken a pictur cuz the look on her face was priceless the waitress seem shock and somewhat offend she ask for anoth plate the nerve

and this my friend was the straw that broke the proverbi 72 dolphin back i can handl be bore to death by an overenthusiast hostess i can handl my menus hand paint on footbal but if you have the nerv to charg 5060 for a steak as this suppos upscal steakhous doe i will not toler a dirti footbal on my plate nor be treat like ask for a clean plate is an outrag request

w left without even drink our wateri usual tri to check out a restaur health inspect befor i go therethi time i did not the pizza was alright noth special my daughter want to go becaus i think she like the guy behind the counter anyway after go home and look them up i discov they have fail their last 2 inspect for thing like debri on their meat slicer food not at correct temp and worst of all there was indic that they were either smoke in the kitchen smoke outsid with the kitchen door open or both this is unaccept to me that employe of a food establish would even think this was okher is the link to look them up and other restaur httpwwwmaricopagovenvsvcenvwebappbusinesssearchaspxaspagetitlefood20establishments20searchastypefoodaaaahh temp my old colleg stomp ground  pizza  awesome

thank you eddi pizza and loung for piss in the face of my colleg memories

for the better part of three week find a vast array of coupon from this place all over my truck typic five or six in the door handl and the all famous stack of them in the now bent windshield wiper of my truck i decid to give this place a tri  i will take this regret to my grave

f buck for a larg pizza and a drink shit that is an awesom deal  at least i thought it was  i would have been better off give my money to a bum and have him punch me in the nut  

after call the number on the coupon that litter my truck and park lot i decid to place an order for their special  i ask if their coupon special includ deliveri  the girl answer the phone said realli well you are go to be wait for a long time it isnt that big of an order  we dont like to deliv for the coupon special  i assum that is the busi equival of fuck no so i tell her ill just come pick it up  i am told my order will be readi from 20 minut to an hour  somewhat of a vast window but i live close so i decid to request a danc from the devil  the devil won

i show up about 30 minut later seem reason and was told i need to wait and was offer to rent a hookah while i wait  are you fuck serious   not want anyon to spit in my food i polit tell her no and sit down on the couch to watch the game on tv  she then turn the channel to someth else

leav 20 minut later when my pizza is done the cook come out after hand it over to her run out ask me what i order  i tell him and he open up the box again look at it and say i am good to go  i dont know what the hell that is about until i get home

of cours they fuck up my order  im not surpris or amus  at least i got my can of soda

i take the pizza home  not what i order  in retrospect i should have put a totino in the oven  this pizza tast like a generic undercook store brand pizza  not onli was my order wrong it was veri undercook  i had to put it in my own oven when i got home miss even more of the game  i ate 3 slice and threw the rest away  i didnt even want to give the leftov to the dog they would probabl bite me for feed them that shit  

serious how do you ruin pizza  it is like toast

th food was shit the servic was even wors  but that can of mountain dew i got was nice and chilli  at least they have that go for them  you earn one star  

the coupon from this place no longer blow around the park lot of where i live like tumblewe on a holi war of declar jihad against tastebud around the greater temp area but the scar of eat here will remain forevafter hear such great thing about this and read the awesom review i twist my girlfriend arm last night and convinc her we should check this place out instead of our normal sushi spot well it end up give her a reason to say she told me so  either everyon write awesom review about this place has never had sushi befor or they are get paid to tell everyon how awesom and amaz this place it  the food was veri bland and didnt look as though it was the best qualiti  i even tri out the garlic chicken per all the review while that was pretti decent it was noth to rave about
even though this place is right around the corner and realli quick to get to i dont think i will ever be go back to itnever had a wors experi at ani restaur the main thing that rattl my nerv was the servic i had recent move into the neighborhood and had a latenight sushi crave so i thought i would tri this place out when i walk in i notic right away that it look like this place was be ran by a bunch of kid grant the hostessserv didnt do anyth wrong they certain werent invit i sat myself at the sushi bar 

after look over the all you can eat menu i told the waitress that i had decid to do that they inform me that it was just a littl pass 10pm and that last call was 1030 i have been to a few all you can eat sushi place in vega around close and understood the last call rule but the way the said it to me made me feel like i was inconvenienc them let me first start by say the menu was veri limit compar to other sushi establish around the citi i was sit liter right in front of the two sushi cook neither of them acknowledg me but instead were speak about some of the tabl in the restaur make fun of them and badtalkng the hispan cook in the kitchen line behind them

aft about 5 minut of just sit there the server came by and took my order i was crave a bake rolllik a lasagna they had one similar so i order that along with a coupl other right when one of the cook bigger guy that seem to have been in charg saw my order he told me he couldnt make that roll becaus he was out of scallop i know for a fact they didnt run out of scallop becaus i saw one of the prep cook with them for whatev reason they just didnt want to deal with it 

anyhow i order someth in place of that roll while wait and observ these guy go back and forth about how they cant wait to get out and huf and puf everi time someon order someth els i couldnt help but to think whi am i spend money in this place i sat there for serious just about 10min for two roll when i was finish with those i was expect my other to come upwait for anoth 10 minut befor the cook realiz he forgot to start make it

to shorten up this review a bit i am gonna leav it at that the servic was aw and the food was crap pleas peopl drive a littl further and spend your money at goyemon or even oyshi at least you know they appreci your busi youll get good servic and the food is great speak of goymeonwe have been regular at this place for over 2 year after our favorit sushi jointbrian beach close we use to come about onc a week or so until all our waitress were replac with some new one our onc a week trip becam more like onc a month dont get me wrongbut if your go to name your restaur 808pleas have some sens to have peopl with some aloha or peopl that can pronounc the hawaiian term that on the menu 
nevertheless we walk in tonight excit to use our gift certif that we got for christma bring in some out of town famili and have the worst experi ever what a shame 808 sushi too our surpris after a horribl custom servic experiencewait to get our order about 3 time hot tea not hot and not even warm waitress clear plate while were in the process of eat off of them water not refil time remind waitress what we order and then the most unbeliev experi ever now were readi to pay with our 200 gift certif  quick the waitress say we cant do cash valu and that the 200 will be forfeit im appal and state we dont want cash back we just want the remaind of our balanc perhap in anoth gift certif she rush to her manag on duti who took about 30 minut to call the general manag agn to tell us the same thing now you have not onli lost loyal custom but this loyal custom has no problem share the stupid of this restaur

 never post so strong befor but i felt i must warn peopl strongly

read my rate ive veri fair  i eat out a lot at a huge varieti of place hole in the wall like contigo all the way to 150200 person meals

i bought the yelp coupon after read good review it was a bad move  ive had good and great peruvian food in mani place this is averag at best

thi place should be way cheaper due to
 plain  cheap decor lowend
 locat in  lowend strip mall in low end part of town
 low quantiti of food they give 
 veri hungri when we left  order 2 dish 1 appet and 3 alcohol drink 80 with tip 

we went on a week night for dinner we were the onli peopl there the entir 15 hrs

specifics

pisco sour  1 star
 noth special for flavor ive had much better pisco sour doubl the size for less 6 for a 6 ounc glass which was most ice is a rip off 

shrimp cevich  2 stars
 they care more about present than quantiti or flavor 15 that was the size of my fist should have been at least 2x the size it was for the price

main entre  2 stars
 flavor were fine but noth special food quantiti was half the size it should have been

then to top it off i ad wrong on the check and the 10 i would have save with the coupon was cancel out and the owner did not even mention it to me and charg my cc the wrong amount so either he did not check the s or he was dishonest


mayb this place has decent lunch special and im be veri generous with that assumptbe care when you order happi hour drink dont open a tab 

last night we went to celebr a friend who graduat and is leav the countri and came at the begin of the 79 happi hour we were a pretti larg group and our waitress was veri attent ensur that we all had fresh drink when requir my boyfriend and i each had two old fashion old fashion which were water down and full of ice but for 5 we werent complain 

howev when we request our check at 915 fifteen minut after happi hour end our waitress gave us a group check for almost 300 with everyon charg full price for their drink when we complain she said that she had no way of know what time ani of us order our drink so she couldnt give us the happi hour price even though we had been there for two hour sudden what should have been a 20 check becam 74 includ an outrag autogratu 

this may not matter to the typic old town scottsdal crowd but we are graduat student and cant afford a bar tab like that so thank mabel for steal my food budget for the week with everi bowl of ramen ill think of youi am not sure where to start  after meet some friend for a bbq my wife suggest that we stop for a few drink at augi 

 we arriv about 815 and the place was pretti busi  we found a seat at the bar and order a coupl of beer and chees stick  i guess they didnt hear our order becaus we receiv pretzel and chees instead  not a big deal but wtf 

 they had music play and a custom who look somewhat like jabba the hut serious wasnt satisfi with the volum turn it up mani time and the staff kept turn it down  this was happen while mani famili were there tri to enjoy there meals

thi bar came complet with a overweight drunk girl that was make her way around the bar and kiss multipl guy and tri to jam her tongu as far down their throat as possibl  she appar was friend with the young femal bartend who continu to watch her and give her shot  i guess i expect this at other place such as roman oasi but what a treat to see this while enjoy a few beer and pretzel  

dont stop read  we are just get to the good part   

i notic a drunk young guy sit at the end of the bar  he had a basebal cap on and his face was veri red  his eye were close from time to time while he was wait for his friend to return  i could tell he was trash  i told my wife to take and look and sure enough when she did he threw up a littl bit on the bar and his hand  he clean it up a bit but just sat there   i told both the bartend and they did noth   a few minut later he had major projectil vomit at the bar    i told the manag who appar couldnt see what we were watc and he went to talk to the custom  the manag ask him to leav but i guess in not a veri forc way becaus the custom finish his beer and then left   

the end of our incred visit was cap off by the follow event  the bartend came and told me that the guy at the end of the bar want to buy you a drink  i ask doe he want to buy me a drink or my wife  she state that he want to buy us both a drink  i told her no thank you  my wife went to the restroom short after this and the guy at the end of the bar follow her  he return befor she did and came over to talk to me  he explain that he was a regular at the bar and continu talk to me about a bunch of nonsens and soon i just ignor him until he left  i am confus whi a self proclaim colleg student would want to buy us drink 

this place need help   i am not sure the owner know this is go on  if the owner is the manag i spoke to then he is in way over his head   

it will not surviv  if it doe it wont be from me spend money therewent into the dark bathroom
flip on the lights
scurri roach as in plural ran into hiding
i squealed
w lefttwo time i go to this place differ week and two time the same thing happen 

im use to wait at the hhagg on sahara  not a problem 3040 minut  mayb i can live with it so it came as no surpris when i tri the imperi palac i was told it was 40 minut for a tabl not a problem so i start walk around check out the restaur when i notic  the place is less than 12 full okay so i meander back up to the front  ask the guy  what give  the kitchen is back up   hmm back up whi  the place aint full  so i wait a few anoth 10 minut no one is seat cant help myself walk around again everi tabl has their food  so again  i walk up to inquir  were short on wait staff  i polit ask to remov my name from the list later 

so wouldnt you know im back again this time gf has a comp she want a big ol pancak i have my doubt  but let tri it again it dejafrickin vu all over againsam scene  12 empti  50 minut wait this time  f you veri much  

and to think i use to recommend the sahara locat to other  f that        close       

this disast case buffet final fold  the food all look about right but was just so aw tast i dont know how they did it  the coupl run the place were real sweet so i tone my origin review down a lot but suffic it to say they just didnt have a clue what they were do     o

fortun a great new buffet china oliv just open down the street today  it everyth this place never was     sniff i cant believ i was made to cri on the insid no less on new year eve my hubbi and i came here think we would split a burrito sinc i know how big the burrito can be at chipotl  

we wait in line i watch the two guy in front of me each get 2 tortilla each for their burrito and the girl behind the line realli pile on the rice bean and their choic of meat i was think wow these burrito are even bigger than what i rememb 

then when it came my turn for my burrito the girl behind the counter took one look at petit me and took out one tortilla and gave me a skimpi serv of rice bean and serious like 5 piec of meat i felt so crest fallen  i look at the measli portion that was go to be my burrito i look at the girl behind the counter and ask whi the two guy in front of me got such massiv burrito but not me she just roll her eye at me and went on to the next costum 

boy was i disappoint and i check too with those two young guy in case they paid extra for their mega massiv burrito nope same price as what i paid 

i serious want to take a photo of my burrito next to their caus mine would look like the runt of the litter it was so pathet so much smaller in size 

i thought mayb it was an off night but from read the other review mani other custom have receiv the same uneven servic 

chipotl corpor you should take note sinc as corpor you take such pride in provid a good product and servic that is the chipotl brand and signatur 

well this particular locat is not make the grade 

and sniff now i know what be an unwant stepchild feel like sniffim basic 99 sure i wrote a review of this place about 8 month ago and now there areno review is it possibl for them to take stuff down no doubt they want all previous review removedit not just me the previous stack of bad review was proof that this place is serious the worst mcdonald ever frank im surpris that mcdonald corp continu to allow them to oper this franchis locat ronald mcdonald would roll in his grave basic 60 of the time were told to park and if it not me be told to park and wait it usual the person in front of me the ice cream machin is out of order or down for clean your pick more often than not which is total awesom when your in line someon pull in behind you you order ice cream they dont have it then you get to wait in line to get through the drive thru it would be brilliant if they would post that befor the point of no return in the drive thru lane i dont know what the deal is if managementown just dont care or if they dont know what go on ill sum it up with my most recent drivethru experi there

girl hi welcom to mcdonald now featur the cherri berri chiller what can i get you
m can i get 2 medium cherri berri chillers
girl were out
m but you just said you had them
girl no i said featur we dont have them

and she probabl spit in the sprite i got insteadcan they be ani slower

seri  the onli thing you can realli review a kfc for is how good the servic is  this one the line of custom is ten deep there are three peopl stand around the kitchen and the cashier that behav like she just learn to think  it did not help that all the custom had to discuss practic everi menu item in detail  i almost bag it but 20 minut later i head out with my dinner  

damn i wish there were a popey around hereok so this is right down the road from me so i thought conveni  unfortun that did not save this place
1 menu is expensive
2 food is alright but not memor in ani way really
3 the staff are pretti much worthless  i went there 3 time 3 time  and each time they screw up the order  the girlfriend is vegitarian and of cours they still put meat in it so she couldnt eat her dinner  then when we told them about this they just said sorri and that it  the next time we went back we order churro didnt get them but they didnt forget to bill us  of cours when we call they said ohh well come back and you can have them  yes i get that i paid for them but let not go out of our way and go abov and beyond let just make me wast my time and gas for your screw up and then there was anoth time they screw it up

so we have a rule 3 strike and your out  would not recommend this placei had to take a coupl of hour to calm down to write this review  i have never been so annoy in my life

i usual go to the starbuck on 16th stbut they dont have a drive thru  the one on thomas32st has the worst servic so i decid to the 44th st locat today  i was crave a roast pepper panini today real bad

i get up to the drivethru to order my panini 

no you caaaaaaaaant haaaaav that i am soooooo sorrrrrrrrrryyyyyy  we have been wait for a new order to come in

ohwel do you have ani other paninis

instead of her answer she said you will have to stay in the drive thru line but it doesnt look like it that long

greatnow i am stuck in a drive thru line that i cant get out of  i was held hostag  there wasnt anyth els i want  so i had to wait 20 mintu to get out of the drive thru  

funni thing the person in front of me got a coupon for a free drink becaus they were out of what they order as well  i of cours got nothif the owner read yelp

dear owner  

fire your counter staff  i think theyr terribl  im assum they are your daughtersfamili becaus i cannot imagin them last veri long at ani other restaur  they seem rude disinterest disorgan slow and immatur  they dont seem to give a darn about the reput of your restaur  even if the food was 5star qualiti i would still not return becaus of the counter staff

darlen p


now for my review  unless they chang their way do not eat here

i realli realli want to like this place and patron a local restaur  we live veri close by and were hope this would be our goto place for mexican food  been to this place 3 time all of them for takeout and all of them either bad or mediocr experi  first time i walk in was their open week  i was the onli one at the counter and the girl behind the counter was write someth and didnt even acknowledg me for a minut or two  she wasnt super help when i ask about menu item  i brought home a chicken burrito for my husband and a chicken chimichanga for myself  the burrito was cold dri and bland  the chimichanga was warm but it was also dri and the meat tast burn  it look like normal cook chicken but just tast realli burn  it was as if they had burn the outsid of a whole chicken realli bad but just cut off all the blacken part and still serv up the meat that didnt look burn  it was weird  we shrug all of this off as open week issu and decid to give the place anoth tri  again we realli realli want to like this place

when my husband went anoth time there was a line at the counter to order  while wait in line he notic that the counter girl were realli slow to acknowledg the next peopl in line even though the girl themselv werent too busi they were check their phone and nail etc between custom  they were slow to take order and even had troubl take order like they couldnt keep track of whether the custom had said chicken or beef and had to keep go back and ask  when the finish order came through the window they mix up whose order was what and kept give out the wrong thing  when my husband got the food home taco it was just okay noth great

th last time i went was one of the worst takeout experi ive ever had  there was a line and again it was slow move  there were onli about 6 peopl befor me but i wait in line over 10 minut just to order  when i final got up to the counter i was not acknowledg in a time fashion even just a hi with you in a sec would have been fine  after anoth coupl of minut i order two combin plate and an order of mini chimi to go  she said it would be about 10 minut   there were no seat at first and hard anywher to stand so i had to stand near a trash can and almost block the front door for 10 minut  then final a tabl open up and i wait anoth 10 minut  by this time there was no line and it seem i was the onli one wait for food  i was get annoy now and was about to inquir about my order when i saw the counter girl look toward me seem realiz that i was still wait  i then saw her turn to the kitchen window and heard her ask the cook about my order  i could hear them talk and it sound like they had lost my food ticket  serious  she search around and found it  then she turn toward me and shout across the way did you want chicken or beef mini chimi  i could not believ it  this was more than 20 minut after i had order them and been wait   she offer no explan or apolog for have me wait longer just spoke to me as if i had onli been wait for a minut or two for my food  after i answer beef she told the cook and my food was miracul readi about 2 minut after that  then my ticket number was call out and my food was left on the counter  again no apolog no explan noth  i was so appal annoy and angri that i didnt even want to get into ask about the poor servic  i just took the food and swore to myself never to go backand to yelp about the experience

bottom line  stay away becaus of the counter staff  i get the impress they couldnt care less about the custom  the food which i find to be cold andor bland or just okay isnt good enough to overcom their horribl servic  such a shame becaus i would still occasion go for decent price okay food if i actual like the servic and atmospheralthough i give the group of friend i was with saturday night 5 enthusiast star i have to say this was a veri disappoint bar experi upon walk in i immedi felt like the space look exact like everi other brand new irish pub  you know the one pretend to look weather and old  and they all end up freakish look the same this place is an exact replica of darci mcgee at temp marketplac which isnt too bad if you like the prepackag generic irish pub feel 

i order my usual favorit bevvi that i order at everi fine irish establish  a snakebit basic term for a mixtur of beer and hard cider and i said with guin the bartend look at me and snap that call a black velvet  not a snakebit   which i did look up later and in fact a black velvet was creat in london england and a tradit irish snakebit is made with guin  i know this argument is neither here nor there but he was realli quit rude about it

anyway the band that was play remind me of a cross between irish music and kenni loggin so we decid to go to our first love rula bula i did confess to the bartend at rula bula that i did in fact cheat on them a littl bit  but they said that after a littl bit of counsel our relationship should be back to normal in no time it was like  i play just the tip look up old school if you dont know what i am talk about and i definit did not like how it feelconsid that they were shut down in august by the health depart and just got a c a coupl of day ago at the next inspect is enough for me to write them off it let me know they realli dont care about the health and safeti of their custom last thursday i got their tom yum soup with shrimp which came out to 1236 becaus they dont take card payment for order under 15 so your alreadi rape me with your overpr msg fill soup but now add extra 50 cent penalti becaus my order is under 15 anyway i had the soup and short after got a headach and upset stomach i know my bodi and the reaction it has to certain food and i can say with 100 certainti that soup was an msg fill mess i am happili write this place offi wish this thing had an option to vote 0 star becaus this place was a piec of shit  the chef look like a ghetto wrestler who should be fight on ufc and his dish are so unrefin he probabl never went to culinari school or els he use to be a sous chef at oliv garden  on the menu he writesthi is how i cook dont break my ball he has got to be the most ignor uneduc fool who got a chanc to cook  the servic was mediocr food is wayyy overpr never go here  the food it was terribl  i like my pasta al dent but he didnt even cook his pasta  the sauc was ok a littl salti but i couldnt get over the pasta  it was like bite into a straw  this chef need to learn how to cook pasta  that foundat stuff  he suck  food suck the restaur vibe suck and i give it a big fat zero  he need to go back to wherev the hell he came from and mayb tri cook again after take some high school level food classes
ugh

update

   you obvious have no idea what flavor is im sure you are accustom to oliv garden type food sinc you seem to be a pro  howev cafe martorano use onli the best qualiti product come in and show your face we will definit give you a tour and show you product im sure you have never seen and with your non exist culinari background im sure you cant pronounc ughhhhhh
let negat the price here becaus the meal was free and ill still say quit possibl one of the worst meal i have ever had my chicken parmigiana tast like someth i microwav from a michelina frozen dinner on top of that the waiter was a condescend eegit with a superior complex listen to me and listen to me now dont come here there are so mani good italian place in las vega that there is no need to stop at this selfright restaur in the rio do yourself a favor and go to valentino in the venetian or rao in caesar palac 

cheerlol this place is a joke although it worth a visit just to see how off the wall it is and to bring home a good stori of the awkward 

im a foodi and know for a fact i could cook protein better than the head cook i know for a fact there are better tast pasta from sysco i also know when i can tast a marinara that has a base of can tomato yet it call homemad i know for a fact that lipton style instant ice tea out of a plastic bottl doesnt cut it as a drink in a restaur of this price rang 

ive travel itali ate at some of the best itali has to offer and i have a moder respect for the cuisin but even if i do over look the under cook pasta and a horribl dri out meatbal and bring it all down to flavor this place still just doesnt cut it and dont even get me start on the servic 

we tri this place on a whim befor the penn and teller show as it look to be the closest thing to fine din at the rio but we should have known better when there are tvs play the god father all over the place the rio realli need to up their din game 

if your a foodi my suggest is go for a overpr poor mix drink at the bar to experi the train wreck that is martorano and take home a stori of a restaur you will never forget

oh yeah what the hell was that thing that martorano call bread wow who ever came up with that one need to be taught the basic of bake bread againmy wife and i decid to head out to the galleria mall today and visit best buy and costco  we were there earli and the store were not open yet  so we decid to grab a brunch  as we drove around look for a place to eat we notic a small restaur locat on a strip outsid of the sunset casino  the alohoa kitchen  we figur it was a mompop kinda restaur and thought it would be good to tri and dine here

her is the good  as you walk in it is pretti clean and spacious  it has a tiki type built to it  pretti cool  also from the menu offer everyth was reason price  about 810 per plate

now the bad no custom were in the restaur bad sign  i order the teriyaki chicken with rice  and my wife order the rib with rice  it was serv on a styrofoam plate with soft utensils

oh my okay breath while eat the rice it was like grind pebbl  i had to turn to my wife and tell her that we are in bedrock  call me fred flintston and her wilma  we need bam bam to hammer the rice and make it edibl  

note to the cook  how to cook rice pour rice into rice cook pot add water i think this step was serious miss make sure you measur at least a 13 index finger size of water at the top press cook and wait for 30 minut for beep  damn  how hard is it to cook rice man  i know we live in las vega it is in a desert and we need to conserv water but dog just sacrific and add a cup of water to your rice  

as for the teriyaki chicken i think they serv me yesterday chicken  it tast like overnuk chicken  extrem rubberi and veri tasteless  in order to hide this defici the cook lather the chicken in teriyaki sauc  the end result  it look and tast like eat molass with uncook rice  yuck yuck and gazillion yuck

i ate 3 spoon too many

a for my wife rib it was tough as hell  again it was obvious nuked

of note there are peopl in the world who think they can cook who are good cook who can open a restaur and survive

and then there are owner like the aloha kitchen who think they can cook who have no clue how bad their food is who still end up open a restaur and who probabl would not survive

fin i would not recommend this place  we definit will not return  for two of us with drink and tip it amount to 24  honest a better deal would be to go to chili  have a decent appet and 2 entre for 20 

i wish we can rate this a zero or negat starsad this place was a real disappoint bought a grouponnow lunch special went over had a decent tuna melt and then went to pay with my groupon and they said the decid not to honor it becaus to mani peopl had bought them 

so they expect me to pay for my lunch even while the deal was still up on groupon and they were sell more of the deal sleazi busi with run of the mill bar food 

not worth the effort  typic las vega scammerthe reason whi i am give this place a 1 is over exceed it it should be a negat 5 star my friend and i usual come here all the time sinc they live across the street and my friend walk up to the bar and ask a simpl question regard a beer to see if there was a differ and the bartend repli well obvious it fuck differ with an attitud and the server state that we should not go to the bar sinc she is our servic so doe that mean your not allow to go to the bar to order drink if your sit down the custom servic from the bartend is terribl his name is mikey that just so rude for him to be a smart ass we will never come here againim write this bad review on principle

w were in the area for dw bistro and decid to spend our 30minut wait at starbuck i order some sort of passion ice tea and then stood asid as i patient wait a coupl who order after me seem to be good friend with the barista and they got both of their drink ahead of me ok not a big deal but then anoth custom also receiv his drink befor mine show up at that point i decid to get closer to the counter final the barista put down some sort of ice drink in front of me i didnt catch the name but it look like it could be mine so i grab it and took a few sip at that point the barista ask the next custom if he was wait for a drink it turn out that i had grab his i put it back down and tell her ive been wait for my drink for a while she then prompt hand me my ice tea where was that 510 minut ago

i apolog for the long journey with no payoff im not sure whi my drink took so long but they didnt seem to care and offer no apolog similar i felt no remors about take someon els drink and forc them to make him another

i also feel no remors for give this starbuck a onestar reviewi dont like to leav bad review but do yourself a favor and avoid this place i got a groupon for 9 for a dozen cupcak but would have been better off spend the money on a box of cake mix and some frost and let my fouryearold have at it  onc you walk in this place you know youv made a mistak  all their sampl cake look terribl  they even had sampl serv piec that consist of a piec of cardboard glu with plastic cup and tissu paper i have no idea what you would do with that  their cupcak are a far lower qualiti than what you could get at your local groceri store for much less  they onli had about three cupcak readi for pick up so i had to wait for over half an hour while the ladi walk around look for cupcak and frost them  the flavor of the frost and the cake itself was cheap  i cant imagin anyon go in there and actual order a cake  they would definit be disappoint  i cannot fathom whi the owner thought they should go into the cake make busi becaus i dont know ani mom who couldnt make a better birthday cake than they do  all their sampl photo are jokecame here the other night 15 minut till close and the walgreen employe was stand outsid the store smoke a cigarett and not let anyon in when i show her it was 15 minut until close she said my iphon was fast interest becaus 2 peopl came up after me and all our phone were the same time horribl represent of this popular storeitem selected

first review will be our experi in the bar for happi hour and the second in the dark dark world of the outdoor dinner seating

w valet park our car without a care in the world it was my wife birthday so we thought wed get to the restaur earli and enjoy the happi hour in the bar rachel was an absolut love waitress our cocktail parti of five and appet were simpli a veri warm invit and love experi the arisan chees plate was enjoy along with the grill sausag trio the happi hour buffet that is advertis simpli didnt exist cocktail beyond their hous pour were overpr as expect 

overal the experi was veri nice and id return for this portion of the even but you might want to read my review of the dinner experience




aft a love experi in the bar for happi hour separ review we were seat in the outdoor dine area no one got us as we request when our reserv was readi and they didnt come to our tabl but ask us to come up to the hostess stand  no big deal but a bit tacki and awkward for all 

this is veri sad as were phoenician for 25 year and have experienc this restaur over the years

our waiter eric didnt seem to want to be there or make our experi better in ani way eric seem to have had a bad day and so would our tabl of five along with my wife for her birthday celebr 

we order direct from the dinner menu as we had just enjoy app in the bar it was obvious that eric wasnt pleas with this but he march off and place our order 

upon deliveri next time we saw eric all was just fine until i cut into my 44 strip steak after some time eric stop by and ask how dinner was i show him the steak and ask if it was medium no and he took it away he came back and ask if id like anoth glass of cab  well no unless your manag is buy so i might have it with the steak i order ten minut later when the rest of the tabl was about done with dinner my steak was deliv and yes it was cook to a perfect medium although whos hungri after sit that long and nibbl off everyon els plate 

how my wife birthday go well not real well did eric bring the wine dessert or anyth to enhanc the experi no i spoke with alec the manag and he simpli could not have care less his eye were glazedov as i explain the experi and lack of respons from his staff alec was truli the manag of a restaur that i would never want to experi again he didnt sympath apolog or even care about me or my famili

th last time i went i got the fish taco and was sick for the next 2 day i went onlin to look up their health inspect and discov they have fail the last 2 inspect for thing not be at the correct temperatur and some other major violat needless to say i will not be back until this is corrected

and for the big guy that work the front counter  the drive throughsmilejust a littlepleas you made me feel so uncomfort when i order my foodi was smile and ask how your day was and you look right in my face and did not respondgod help me but i was trap at this resort and had to eat lunch here  yes i onli ate here onc but i got the idea that the circl of cilinari hell i was in was typical

 1 star  wierd dark  came in at 2pm on a weekday and what light were on most those over the bar were off were dim down to the stripclub level  to encourag more drink  to save electr just flat out weird
 1 star  horribl dread food  a quesadilla should not be serv cut up in to slice and stack on top of each other if the slice are so wateri with oil so underdon so glutin sticki that each slice cannot be pull away from that below it  and what with the bizarr chipolt sauc pour over my stack mass  it was like wateri mayo with orang color  foul beyond word  the pico de gallo was okay though  but then there was the side salad  old tast lettuc chunk of flatfridgetast tomato and crouton that came out of a stale bag left open sinc not sure when  i dont think i have left a salad untouch in year until today  how was the dress for the salad  oh hi nice to see you mister plastic bottl blue chees  
 1 star  1 star  server  i sat at the bar and with about 12 stool avail there was onli one other taken so it was not busi  the bartend was attent not neglect  but there could have been some warmth some pleasantri  right  i mean take a few moment to ask someth besid the basic  whatcha want  no
 1 star1 star  the music  it like the 80s are aliv and kick here at the ole sangria  sort of cool but not as this is just not that sort of place
 1 star  the price  onc again as with the other eateri on properti it like they know they have you by the shorthair  a quesadilla and small salad for about 20 without ani drink water free  ridic

ther isnt much more to say about this place other than it is the 2nd restaur on the premis of the scottsdal resort and confer center  i understand that the pool bar which was not open the few day i was here serv food from sangria so ssdd is the vibe  what sangria and it snazzier but still crappi sister joint the palm court need is a food facelift  they could get away with be mediocr in so mani other way decor outdat vibe in general if the food was good  but it not even fresh 

this resort need to step up their food game  mayb they can get away with serv slop to the convention but the fact that they had room avail at last minut notic when the rest of scottsdal was book up speak mightili to the poverti of their food qualiti  again a sad avoid voteok this is not a food review 

let start with the good great space beauti modern industri space good outdoor space well that end the good 

so on a sunday befor a spring train game i show up hope for a fun brunch befor some work after check in and request the rare and unavail breakfast menu we were seat on the upstair patioand then the wait began 

andw waitedand waitedand wait that tabl over there appar has a server oh appar he isnt our server ok well the tabl behind us complain so that tabl got a well im not your server but i am help out  so20 minut in hmmm mayb this place cant plan for the realiti pregam giant game or mayb they think this is sued or some other club where peopl come in despit the horrend lack of attent to detail and servicebut hey we can wait a few minut longerbut should we need to wait 20 minut 

ok let go to the bar whoa all the waiter are hang out around the comput entri systemumm dude what the code for water ummm hey there are 6 of you here how about serv some tabl im no expert just a suggest 

let leav 

soi cant speak to the food but a good sourc tell me it match the servic disappoint at best 

pleas dont wast that build  either get your act togeth or hand over the space  scottsdal is full of wannabesit doesnt need anothwe check out rnr on sunday just a few day after open in all fair i have to agre with mani of the other review even though they are new these thing are fixabl so hope the feedback will be taken in the appropri vein the build is veri cool and the vibe was energet on a sunni sunday morn there was an abund of waiter but they seem to be confus and frenet without a real focus on the custom the menu is veri limit and our server had not eaten most of the item he was struggl to explain our drink took more than 15 minut to arriv even though we saw them sit at the bar for the entir time our water had just disappear then the food i order the grill chees  a rare treat and when i order it i want it good it was cold and overwhelm by heavi bread the chees wasnt melt i sent it back and they simpli nuke it and brought it out icki our son want a kid cheeseburg and the staff kept come back and forth not sure if there was a singl burger or slider for kid it becam comic after the third person came out my husband order a salmon omelet with sever addit fix the egg tast like box egg and it was lacklust and flavorless we even took the time to provid feedback to manag but we got a weak smile and come back and tri us again he made no effort to make thing right either by comp someth els to tast or provid an incent to come back there are too mani restaur in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocr the young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it give but the major of the tabl on sunday am were famili or middl age and we saw similar respons at other tablhonest the drink are overpr and have a hint of rub alcohol
honest my lunch was just okay
honest they have a drink call the stigmata
honest i am dread have to give them 2 star given the hype

but i am suppos to be honest

thi place has been the buzz sinc befor i return statesid my cowork had also been hear the same buzz we just had to go as the final to our week of lunch yeah i probabl wouldv been better off at the billet bar across the street i mean it is biker week the peopl watch wouldv been stellar the onli peopl watch i had at rnr was the gorgeous server outsid our window on the patio but even his piec of art bodi wont bring me back

th first hint shouldv realli been the overpr drink we start with i figur for that price they should be damn good so i order some lime concoct a cowork got the stigmata holi strong and not in a good way i mean i appreci my drink as much as the next but not when i cant even enjoy it 

one of my other cowork on the other hand was enjoy his blue moon that was until he held it up to take anoth sip and the entir bottom of his glass fell off yes fell in one piec onto our tabl what happen to the content do you ask that went all over him the tabl insid someon wallet and onto an iphon and my face the waiter wasnt even realli apologet about it asid from give us some extra cloth napkin which werent soak anyth up at all no wet rag no comp no apolog noth but anoth glass of blue moon we were hope wasnt bought at a prank store and a sticki tabl face and sunglasses

th chicken lollipop were not what i expect but realli werent bad i did enjoy those i also enjoy the present of my fri cute silver bucket ton of fri couldnt finish

i end up get a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other good on it total forgot to order it without tomato but i pick it off easili 

i know what your think they serv breakfast here til 2pm whi the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast honest none of it woo me enough that it look delici they had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of thing to order but im glad i didnt after see a cowork tini ass omelet and bread with no other side for 10 also i high doubt their amish french toast is all that amish just sayin i know a bit or two about amish goodness

so back to my lunch it was just eh which was sad the descript sound so delici i realli was expect to be wow final after all the mishap id had up until this point i do admit i love the bread it was delici i also appreci that despit them not have honey mustard aioli or anyth els to dip my fri in asid from ketchup and barbequ sauc which was given with the sweet potato fri ew they tri to make me honey mustard unfortun it was just honey mix in with bottl mustard ketchup i end up use the ranch dress from the lollipop 

what i paid for this was ridiculous
th way they react to the beer mishap was ridiculous
th food was meh
not even i was tempt to tri breakfast there
it was like the beauti model that has no brain and i want some brain thought go into my dine experi dont tri to woo me with simpl sex appeal

on of my cowork comment that mayb in 6 month when the pan are season well after be use the place will be worth it to tri again i told him maybe

had to edit that someon from our tabl got terribl ill too oy veyfool me onc shame on you fool me 6 other time becaus i tri to give your restaur the benefit of the doubt and i will not return despit one experi with good servic there have been six other time when i have had  incred aw servic that not a good ratio and at this point i just cant justifi come back nor would i recommend rnr at all

mi most recent experi seal the one star review first there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us we sat ourselv then we sat at a tabl for about 10 minut no waiter to be seen no one even came around to serv the other tabl around us with patron ah ha next we spot a waiter after inquir with this individu as to where our waiter wasif they were close or someth tri to give them benefit of the doubt the waiter look at us begrudg gave us a half eye roll and said i guess i can serv you

wel after that remark i just want to get up and walk out but i stay a decis that i now regret onli to experi more poor servic 

we need more drink our waiter was nowher to be found then we notic all the waiter hang out near the order input comput the restaur wasnt crowd and i know my order wasnt be taken or put into the comput instead it look like social hour unprofession 

this is not the first time that i have experienc inattent and nowheretobeseen servic at rnr and i guess i should have known better i dont even think my request to be seat so that i could have a waiter take my order was that outlandish

i work veri hard for my money to be abl to enjoy some rnr on the weekend so with lot of other place like az88 old town tavern mabel on main firehous patti the lodg geshiaagogo and the list could go on where i can count on be serv by an actual live bodi nonetheless who doesnt even make me feel like they hate me just becaus i walk through the door there no reason to come here

it was especi aw to be treat so poor when im a giant fan and my team flag is hang out front of the establish im go to pass on anymor of this place rnr as im pretti sure it actual stand for realli rude servici agre with everyon on here who said the food is great but manag suck  we went in with a gift card we got for our wed with the person who gave it to us and other friend  it had never been use and should have had 60 on itth server came back and said it onli had 18 when we were pay the bill  my husband want to handl it discret becaus we were with a group so he paid the server and spoke with the manag stupidh should never have paid until this was resolv  

the guy who bought it pull up his bank statement on his phone to show he paid 60 and we had never been in thereso there was definit a mistak made by the employe who sold it  the manag did not know what to do and said he would talk to their comput guy when he came in laterit been 5 day now and no resolut not even a phone call from the manag to let us know hes on it  we have had  to call sever differ manag who all play dumb im sorri but this is theftsel an 18 gift card for 60and poor manag for not handl it serious too bad becaus we had a great brunch but i dont trust the honesti or the compet of peopl there do not ever buy a gift card from this restaurant

upd file a complaint against this compani with bbb and attorney general officwow do not dine here pleas let me list the reason whi

ov the past month and a half ive gone to yogurtolog 3 time id be there more but i live a solid 20 min away with no traffic but it was realli that good

dur those 3 visit i was treat rude ignor and basic given the impress that my busi was not want what happen appar the same boy work everi singl day ive gone and yes hes a boy obvious not even out of high school hes rude often has his friend in the shop and is incompetent

th high school student yogurtolog use to hire were great there was one guy in particular who was funni outgo and gave the place energi but not anymore

first time i went no place to sit becaus this kidwork friend had taken all the insid spot not onli were they take a bunch of free sampl they were also loud talk about how girl are all hoe and how ugli hoe are the worst come on serious in yogurtolog where there are children

second time no place to sit becaus this kid hadnt bother off to clean off all the sticki tabl i liter had to eat my froyo in the car becaus there was no clean place to sit

thi last time today kid gave free sampl to 3 peopl a small famili stand in front of us when my boyfriend and i walk up to ask him about tri the spici banana mango becaus serious who doesnt want to sampl that he ignor us and walk away behind the counter

given all the other frozen yogurt shop closer to where i live this is an incred stupid move for yogurtolog hire some real worker and fire this clown who obvious doesnt care enough to do his job right

dear vig you might think you are all that but serious get over yourself the hub famili has live on that block for 34 year they have seen restaur come and go if you keep up your attitud you will find yourself push your local custom awayoh thevigaz you usual do so well but when you fail me it alway an epic fail last night you fell flat on your face

i order the vigazz burger anticip greatness

mi girlfriend and her daughter receiv their food and finish their meal i got nothing

whil my girlfriend was still eat i inquir with one of the back server about my burger and was told it was almost ready

15 or 20 minut after my parti finish eat i was still waiting

th other peopl around me whod order around the same time as i some befor most after were finish with their meal and still i waited

i had by this time decid i no longer want my meal but no server was present to inform

whil i wait for the server to come by to deliv the inevit check i notic peopl whod arriv after we order get their meals

and still i waited

fin after over 30 minut and near have to yell to get her attent she was deliv more food to peopl who came long after we order right next to us our server came over

when we inform her that i did not receiv my meal and that my girlfriend order was incorrect onion and tomato present despit a request to not have them and instruct her to remov my meal she just ask if i want it togo

when your servic come up so short as to complet miss a meal you dont mere offer to make it togo

in fair when she brought the check she state shed spoken to the manag and hed also remov my girlfriend burger from the bill

it was a nice gestur but last night it was too littl too late i went home hungri with a major headache

i love the vig but sometim it a major disappointugh i am so disappoint in this place after lunch today sinc they onli serv the lunch menu on weekend we came in to tri the sandwich i had read about the grill portabella with pepper and chipotl mayo befor and decid to order that with a side of the mac  chees that i had last time we sat at the bar and the waitress got our water then didnt come near us again for awhil we were readi to order but she went to this tabl with a huge parti and took care of them first a differ waitress took our order after and told us she would put our order and the larg group order in the comput all at onc so it would come out with their 

more than a half hour goe by while we have to endur the smoker at the bar becaus this place allow that yes it is an outsid patio but they cover all the window open with plastic tarp so there is no real air flow nor are there ani fan to get the smoke moving

w final saw the larger parti food be brought out and figur our meal would soon follow wrong it was anoth twenti minut at least not onli that but anoth coupl that had sat down waaayyyi after we order actual got their food at the same time as we did

i could tell right away our plate had been sit under the heat lamp for some time becaus the pickl slice on my plate was liter hot i ask the waitress if she could bring me a new one that was cold and she came back to tell me they had a busi night last night and they were out of pickl real nice

also i notic my portabella sandwich came on a regular hamburg bun when on the menu it say serv on a fresh baguett soft mushroom soft pepper soft chees and a soft hamburg bunwher did the chef learn how to cook doe contrast of textur mean anyth to him i didnt see ani of the chipotl mayo and certain didnt tast it my boyfriend chees steak sandwich that also came on a baguett actual came out on said baguett but his french fri were soggi not crisp on the outsid like the last time we ate here my mac  chees tast like it was made with some runni queso dip instead of bake like i had before

i would have said someth about my sandwich but honest i was just so tire of tri to talk to the waitress after my pickl situat it seem like they didnt want to deal with me either sorry

th bill came out to 16 and chang so we left a 20 we figur sinc this will probabl be the last time we come here we might as well be decent part patrons

so long codi i hope you can make it in cave creek as a bar that allow smoker to enjoy both their crave at the same timesigh

init i gave this place a 4 star review this morn but i decid that i need to be honest and share an experi here that i had that init i had want to leav out but now i feel that i cant  i want to ignor what realli happen as it been bother me more and more and more as the day has gone on

when i came here the place was empti  it was just 2 worker and not a soul in sight  despit the food be good the servic here left me feel angri and upset  here why

th guy that seat me and obious work here as some form of staff member made it his point to flirt with me non stop so much so that it actual ruin my experi here and i dont know that i will be back  he was so aggress in his tactic that he actual had the ball to pull up a chair to my tabl while i was tri to eat and enjoy my dinner  mind you i was alon and tri to enjoy a good book and some quiet timeand this douch ruin it

h sat with me through the major of my dinner ask me person question about if i was singl what kind of guy iik and other person question that i found grossli innapropri  i was so annoy that i actual had my dinner box up and left half way through lie and say that i had somewher to bejust to get out of here

i found it rude annoy and downright disrespect that a staff member at this establish made it his person playground and take it upon himself to not onli hit on me but spend most of the time sit at my tabl talk to me discuss thing that i found grossli inapporpriate

du to this experi i will not be back to this locat  everhorribl horribl servic is what is was all about my last time there i went there last week dure my lunch break with a coupl of peopl from my work when we arriv we were prompt seat and the waitress came by at took our drink order we all order water and then order our meals

w were then ignor for 45 minut while we wait for our food no check up by the waitress no i am sorri your food is take so long hey do you need a refil no noth at that point sinc we were out of time and had to get back to the offic so we got up to leav that is when we were final notic the waitress came run over almost freak out  say our food is just about readi where were you 20 minut ago

anyway one guy in my parti had guilt over leav and paid for the whole order to go i disagre that he should of done that sinc we were not into them for anyth becaus we were all drink water but that was his choice

i understand that sometim fresh made food take a bit longer when it prepar fresh but not 40 minut but there is no excus to ignor someon for that amount of time

p in respons to the owner comment i stand by what i said in my review as accur so base on what the owner say good custom servic is to call me a liar write a snarki insincer respons and ralli against yelp and other review site complain about how unfair they are  i have read all the owner comment left toward other yelper and there is a consist theme throughout them if someth goe wrong dure your visit dont blame the restaur not a veri product respons in my opinion i think high of yelp as yet anoth tool for consum to made educ decis about where to spend their hard earn money it is also good for busi that go abov and beyond becaus they will alway be reward with my repeat busia cowork recommend this place so my sister and i went for dinner  all in all i just wasnt impress with this restaur so much so that i wont be back

th decor is psychadel 60s  well actual it seem to flux from random thing of the 60s such as band or movi to just psychadel look sticker  it seem like they were just desper to fill in everi empti space on their wall  it a bit over the top when you walk in but i can understand the fun for peopl that particular enjoy that decad  i dont happen to and even if i did like the 60s their decor could have been way less cheesi and still been faith to the theme

each tabl has book toy or memorablia from that same decad which i thought was interest especi sinc our tabl featur a greatest edit of archi comic which i love when i was a littl girl  obvious the music they play is from the 60s and they even show mute ed sullivan show clip on a larg television

when we place our order i told the waitress that i had want a hamburg so she recomend the special which was a rambo burger  the menu didnt realli give a descript on the special part so i order it  it came out with shred barbecu beef on top and an onion ring  i realli just want a simpl burger and had there been a descript when i order i would have pick someth els  still when i scrape off the extra meat and put the onion ring to the side it was a decent burger  actual the qualiti of the burger is whi this review is two star instead of just one espcial when my sister didnt like her chicken alfredo

al in all i wasnt impress with the servic and when we got our bill i was shock when our total came out to close to 4000  like i said the food was good but i cant spend that much in what i assum would be a mom and pop style establishment

192013 respons to owner comments

if there one thing that kinda irk me it the inabl to quiet take a less than posit review and use it construct instead of tri to defend youself against one person bad experi  im alway more than will to give a second chanc and if you check my past review most locat get a better review from the first time when i wasnt impress  this owner respons was that second chanc  howev sinc the owner was abl to go into better detail of my review i figur i would and could afford him the same courtesy

1 cost i hold in my hand my receipt from rambo kitchen date 122612 for the total amount of 3636 close to 4000  now even though i wasnt that impress with the servic it wasnt horribl so i decid to round up my bill with a tip of 364 more for my conveni than for the server reward  henc my bill came to 4000  now the reason for the increas in my bill is becaus i fail to mention the 500 milkshak that we also order  my apolog and the subject of my next issue

2 500 milkshak i love the name of that item all i can think of is vincent vega and his outrag that someth made of milk and ice cream can cost 500  of cours when he tast mia wallac shake he had to agre that it was an amaz shake  i couldnt  the ice cream they use must have been thaw and then refrozen becaus there were crystal part of it that just tast like straight ice  it wasnt quit blend well and im pretti sure if i was a waitress as i have been so im speak from experi i would have notic if an item had bare been touch and ask if someth was wrong  i assum this is not a polici at rambo but everyon has their off day and it not like this is fine dine  in fact the person that order this shake took one tast and didnt touch it again i ate more than her sinc i didnt want to wast an entir 500

3 qualiti of food i apolog sincer for state that my sandwich contain beef it was pull pork now that i rememb it  i assum that i just gloss over that inform and pictur on the menu so i apolog for that as well  now as for the fettucin alfredo  i had decid that i wouldnt go into detail in my origin review but fair fair  my sister love it  she brought the rest home to eat the next day  of cours when she woke up at two in the morn with stomach pain and spent the rest of the next day glu to the toilet she instruct me to throw away her takeout food  im not sure if it was undercook chicken or someth els but the food made her sick  howev ill state it onc again my hamburg onc i had scrape off the pull pork was delici and i didnt get sick

in summat i appreci the archiv posit review that were includ and wish congratul on the patron that enjoy this restaur  i was not one of them and definint wont be  accord ill remov one star due to owner understandwent here today for the first time  we were greet when we arriv and chose a tabl in front  waitress came to take drink order and i put in order for my child meal and a appet  she brought the drink but then didnt return to take the order until the app and kid meal was deliv  we order our food i fed my daughter we ate our huge order of zucchini  the zucchini came with a small dip cup of ranch we were charg for the extra ranch we need due to the size of app  after a while i went to go refil my drink myself and ask about our food  2 order of fish and chip  it had been over 12 hr at this point and i knew there was a issu becaus i could see all the staff in the corner  i could also hear them talk about a lost ticket  we were about to leav and i even told the waitress i just saw the cook drop in fish is that our  wonder whi it had been so long  the waitress was sweet but clear not train to know how to handl a screw up  she proceed to lie to me and say it take a while becaus we need to make sure the fish is cook and what i saw was a to go order  she clear was oblivi that be the onli custom in the restaur no one came in for take out and i had a clear view of the cook  also it pretti common knowledg when you are order fri fish it onli take a coupl minut not 30  we proceed to eat and befor leav a ladi came over full of bad excus we switch staff etc  well as i said had a clear view of the 1 cook who was there from when we walk in to when we left and we had the same waitress so who know what staff she was talk about  she gave us a coupl donut which from what i have read is their apolog   we also use a groupon which by the way mean you cannot order 12 the menu no special etc  bad experi mediocr food for the price poor servic and penal for use a group on

p in respons to robert  my daughter never sat on the floor never color on your veri doubt new tile  shame on you she was bore to tear at the amount of time we were there as were we  my experi was accur  i watch the same cook in the kitchen and our meal there took over 1 hour  bought the groupon on the way in and have a time on the bill  peopl came in after us and left befor us  as i state we were the onli tabl  there was not a 79 nomin delay it took 15 minut for app than anoth 30 for meal  the waitress lie a weak apolog was given at end with a coupl donut  if go back there was ever go to happen your respons has chang that  good luck in busiafter mani attempt to issu a complaint about the horribl servic we receiv i have offici given up reach doug the cafe supervisor they just dont care or give a shit is how i take it so binion cafe can piss offum for dinner it way overpr for what they offer which is realli noth  the onli thing i could realli go for is the roast chicken becaus the roast beef was ined  i cant stand have to peel shrimp cocktail so i skip on that  i couldnt even go for the mexican food area becaus the guacamol look like sour cream that turn green

a for breakfast it might be more worth it  it like around 11 and it cheaper than if you go to the cafe right downstair  they have egg benedict but they overpoach the egg all of themi went to this place and they told us that the kitchen was back up and i couldnt place my order for at least 30 min terribl experioh my godddd we had the worst easter brunch here

aft stand in the cramp wait area for a million year while half a dozen server wander by promis us someon would be with us short we were seat on the windi depress patio the dirti tabl and brokendown theater seat on the patio made me feel like i was eat in a junkyard

our waitress when she was around was pleasant but i wait like 15 minut for a roomtemperatur mimosa and by the time she came to check on us after wed gotten our food i didnt even bother to mention that the mofongo in my mofongo benedict was icecold like near frozen in the middl this dish was also laughabl small is the brunch menu suppos to be tapasstyl as well mayb becaus meanwhil my husband had an omelet which was on ok omelet but serious 13 for an omelet that didnt even come with potato toast or god forbid even a fruit garnish really

thi whole place has an attitud which frank it cannot afford the restaur look like it was furnish with old crap gather from a yard sale and the food is ined at worst mediocr at best we spent 50 and i left feel miserno doubt the hottest mess in downtown one of the first time i visit the bar was air a live episod of the food network show restaur stakeout all about deepli troubl restaur and i got to watch the servic staff laugh at their horribl depict on tv that was about two year ago 

cut to this weekend a beauti sunday morn what sound better than brunch while sit outsid the ladi suggest bb although ive been a number of time for dinner still havent tri brunch plus it super close plus the weathery let do bb we arriv about 1115 order by 1145 i need to to leav by 1pm to meet some folk but we figur there plenti of time 

you know where this is go 

we order a spanish omelet and the bb bake and are told someth about how the bake take an extra 510 minut fine no immedi rush around minut thirti is when thing start to get a littl weird so i mention how excit we are for our dish profus apolog kitchen back up the usual anoth fifteen minut later as the five or six tabl that sat down after us are well into their meal i tell the server we need to get go so either the food has to arriv immedi or well have to split quick run to the kitchen profus apolog our order are the veri next one at the window watch three more order land at tabl around us and final around minut sixti we stand up and begin to take our leav it is almost ten to 1 natur the server is carri our plate right as were pass her she implor us to sit and eat say the meal will be taken care of were starv so we sit down and eat 

not much point go into great detail about the food it was bad the spanish omelet was overcook egg with a few red pepper and a slice of suppos manchego chees on top slap on a plate no accompani no flavor or textur just a quick thrown togeth mess that i am certain took no more than four minut to execut the bake had more flavor chorizo obvi but was also dri and accompani by some curious soggi salad involv fine dice tomato lettuc avocado bean and oliv it was weird disproportion heavi mushi and made no sens 

in other word it was a lousi experi the weather was love the bluegrass band although too loud for talk was a fun touch and the pack seat area bustl with merriment i guess you can get away with a lot on a sunday morn when the weather nice and the mimosa and bloodi mari tap are wide open folk seem happi id have been one of the happi one too if i were get rock on bottomless booz and time was no issu sad we were there for the meal in addit to the sun and the meal was a dumpster fire 

i have it on good author that the reason bb offer such chronic horribl servic is becaus the kitchen is simpli too small to accommod the amount of diner that the hous can accommod if that the case it an unfortun error in the origin design but it cant continu to hobbl the entir oper a restaur cant thrive if it constant apolog for piss off it custom that a model for failur they need to radic simplifi the menu or streamlin the prepar or get rid of tabl or hire faster cook or knock out some wall and expand the kitchen or 

i wont come back at least not for the food ive eaten here sever time and recal a few quit memor bite the mac n chees blew me away the first time i tri it a few other thing have been surpris good but the menu is much like the serviceal over the place and wild inconsist bb is more than the food though which is probabl whi it continu to surviv the locat is premier right in the heart of the art district the bar offer a brilliant select of brown spirit and usual friend servic it more than a restaur it a hub and good thing becaus it wouldnt surviv on the food alone

for those of us who live near andor support the art district bb is a place to embrac and ralli around it exact the kind of thing to want to thrive but it shouldnt get a free pass on be a restaur just for be a cool spot in a cool locat two year ago bb was laugh at it own bumbl self on tv and it doesnt seem like much has improv sinc pitinote my experi is base on mani view of the websit and multipl time call the business

thi place is a joke  i would ordinarili ham up the review in hope of make you laugh but i dont want to water down the point of this review which is that this place is absolut horrifi useless

w onli tri it out becaus of the groupon which offer 25 worth of food for 10  fine  the groupon expir 1018  fine  so of cours be the procrastin that we are we wait until the 18th  which is whi i didnt complain to them about the two hour deliveri time becaus i dont want to be that guy  although i will submit to you that if your a busi and you do a promot this is the sort of thing that you should mayb plan for  just a thought

go to their websit and see if it doesnt remind you of a websit from 1995it ridicul lowbudget and it isnt realli user friend  when we tri to order deliveri last night on the site it said that the first deliveri time avail was 945a the next morn  okay fine  so i call becaus the site said that the hour were until 830 on a sunday  i call at 705p and the manag answeredon the third time i call btwand told me that they had just close  

he said that they were have some glitch with the system and so they just decid to close  he said to put in an order for tomorrow onlin and hed get it to us  so i tri thatexcept the site wouldnt let us order deliveri for the next eveningit said the onli avail time for deliveri were between 945a and 115p  useless

so the next day we tri and order dure the day and guess what the first avail time for deliveri is  yep945a the next morn  unbelievable

so i call the ladi to order direct and she told me it was a two hour wait i said it was fine i gave her the order she took my address fine

145 later i get a call from the deliveri driver say that he cant find my hous number on the street  that becaus he was on the wrong street becaus the ladi on the phone gave him the wrong address and he was a good half hour distanc away from my hous  understand upset he told me he probabl wouldnt be abl to get my food to methen he stop himself and said hed call me back  he didnt

so i call mobil waiter to talk to the manag  no apolog  i ask what would happen with the order and she said hed tri to get it to me but first he had to make a quick stop at a restaur that close in two minut it was 708p and she didnt know when hed get here  so i told her to cancel my order and give me my money back the overag after the groupon valu includ tip and she was like okay  that was it no apolog or explan no noth  which i onli mention to give you an idea of the level of custom servic and compet you can expect

fin she told me id have to take it up with groupon for my money back from them  awesom  she want to give me a credit on my account for the money id spent no more  i declin becaus i dont ever want to deal with them again

thi place is a total embarrass  it a great concept but so is flap your arm and flying



not the owner sent me a messag and here is what she said  i will accept the offer to redeem the groupon and i will post a subsequ review when it warranted

hi richard
mi name is brett i am the owner of mobil waiter i was inform about your order  the issu with the address i do apolog about that confus the main issu that occur is the fact that you live in an area that we do not deliv to which disrupt our system from appli the correct address the other issu was the end of groupon which as prepar as we were in term of staf complet threw us for a loop sinc it seem as though you were not the onli procrastin who wait until the last day to redeem in either case there is no real excus just a horribl mishap i realli just want to apolog for your experi   let you know that if you had an issu with groupon in term of get your money back we would be more than happi to still offer a deliveri to you  allow you to use the groupon although it has expir alreadi as we have done with some of our regular custom who had groupon as well i take pride in my compani i tri my absolut hardest to make sure that everyon  anyon that use us to have food deliv is happi in the end which is whi i am reach out to you to apolog 
have a great dayjoin me in protest
ev sinc border close in town squar and there no more competit for coffe bean  tea leaf they skyrocket their price while still deliv mediocr drink  i will not be pay strip price for coffe and neither should you  

2¢do not believ the hype i have been here four time  each time someth wors happen im not sure who is to blame for the poor behav and bad train wait staff but one thing i can say for sure after the fourth visit is that the poor servic and way below averag food qualiti are definit consistent

mi last and final visit to this restaur includ  frozen reheat crab cake that were disgust an 1100 spinach salad that consist exact of spinach six raw walnut and 5 piec of artichok heart  and then there was the entre  the entre was our final knife in the gut and pocket book  we order the lobster and steak special  we specif ask the waiter for a filet cut of steak  he serv us a small piec of grisli meat that my giant sharp steak knife liter could not cut through  when we told him it was not filet he was condescend and rude and act like we didnt know what we were talk about  grrr  

we were high insult that they would pass this horribl qualiti and poor made menu item off as authent italian cuisin if that is authent italian cuisin no one would ever lay claim to it

th manag half heart apolog although she seem more worri about upset the condescend waiter than she was concern about our horribl experi and she remov the uneaten special from our bill  

i have not ever wrote a bad restaur review howev they should not be abl to get away with this in a citi fill with amaz restaur option   i hope that they can address their issu and be an asset to our communiti in the futurthis place doe not exist we just left the park lotno shop no signag no one answer the phone

we didnt get our beer so had to ask for beer and water and subsequ refil i notic that other tableswho were seat after usbegan get their order befor our and i had to ask the status of our order the server was apologet and relay that they didnt expect the place to get busi sinc they just recent open for busi i found this bothersom and disappoint perhap they need a better strategi to improv their busi oper 

after an hour and a half at a burger joint i was over it sorri but we didnt leav a tip i didnt feel it was deserv with the wait time experienc total durat in the restaur and not be adequ servic 

the one star given is for the appreci of the asian inspir burger and other offer and creation this place has potenti and it look as though it will have a strong follow given prior review 

perhap it was an off night howev there could still be awesom custom servic but they fail to deliv even thatthe raw food wasnt the worst part the in your face manag was

ther was water on our tabl when we were seat a littl creepi sinc we couldnt see that it hadnt been previous been given to someon els  also it was unfilt and had a bad taste

w had heard about bachi burger on diner drivein and dive and check out the review befor go  the menu was veri creativ and my husband and i look forward to our truffl parmesan fri which we order as an appet ronin burger and kiki burger

th fri took a while to come out and while they werent what we expect they were delici  we were disappoint that we werent given plate and that they all didnt have truffl flavor but they were veri good overal and the dip sauc was great

th burger arriv while we were eat our appetizer

w both order our burger rare and our burger both came black and blue  the top on the burger were tasti except the egg on my ronin burger was overdon  my husband manag to eat half of his burger but realli didnt enjoy it

our server never onc check in on us so my husband wasnt abl to send his burger back to be cook  when the server final came back and final ask us how everyth was my husband told him that his burger was undercook and said how disappoint he was that the server never check in with us  the server offer to have anoth burger made or to do someth but my husband didnt want anyth other than the check and ask that the server just clear the tabl  

a few minut later the in your face manag came to the tabl shove the plate under my husband nose and belliger told him that the burger was rare  the manag was realli nasti and defens  we were shock by this  especi sinc we didnt ask the server to send over the manager

th manag came out readi for a fight and refus to tri to understand that all my husband want was recognit that the server should be train to check in on tabl short after food is serv so that issu can be dealt with on a time basis

aft the manag left one of the owner overheard that someth was wrong and came over to the tabl  my husband ask for an apolog from the manag  the manag was brought out and continu to be snarki and defens his apolog to my husband was akin to that of a eighth grader whose mother make him apolog for someth that he didnt  think was wrong

th tabl of five next to us also had undercook burger and didnt eat most of their food either  my husband point that out to both the owner and the manag while they were at our tabl  as you would expect the manag was defens and the owner seem to listen  that said we wont be go back  not becaus the burger were undercook but becaus of the shoddi servic and the bad attitud of management

a i sat there and watch this unfold all i kept think is that this place is probabl a few month away from be a candid for restaur imposs  robert irvin would never allow staff to berat a custom becaus the custom complain about be serv raw food

i understand that restaur can have an off night but the manag attitud is simpli unforgivsuch a disappointment

 had bachi burger bookmark for the longest and even had friend who went and love it so today while choos a place to eat i chose bachi over max brenner yep big mistak 

we order the truffl parmesan fri and salt and pepper fries
for our burger we order the ronin burger and spici miso

w wait 30 minut for our fri and after complain our waitress said she didnt know we want the fri to come out first wthh  she gave us the sauc free of charg which was nice of her even though all the sauc tast weird and citrusi i thought the pineapl ketchup would tast like the special ketchup at umami but it didnt as matter a fact it tast like regular ketchup

our fri final came out and i was disappoint with my truffl parmesan fri the truffl sauc were drizzl light and onli got on the first layer of fries
our burger came out look so delici we both order rare take the first bite of my miso burger i could tast a slight miso tast and then just like that it went away and that was it no other tast from that point on it tast like i was eat tasteless meat the meat were tender but not juici i didnt even bother tri boyfriend burger becaus he said the same thing about hisi took my companyparti of 7 here for our holiday dinner i had a previous experi at this restaur where our waitor ad an item to our bill which we did not know we order they will confus you about what you are actual order sinc it is ala cart when it happen for the second time it was appar as their common practic long stori short my secretari a veri young woman ask the waitor to suggest a steak for her entr the waitor suggest a steak to my secretari by name onli and my secretari agre when we got the bill i found out it was a 180 special steak that was off the menu and no price had been quot upon call the manag she argu with me and was veri defens who want to get rip off at dinner

hey manag when someon call in with a concern you should not argu with them without first at least look into the situat we basic got scam as if we were tourist in a foreign countri the manag who call me back was so defens never apolog and offer to buy me onli drink next time wtf my bill was 108000never have ive been so ignor in a fine dine restaur i had high hope for this place but so rude music was way too loud for a normal volum convers practic had to scream to talk as im read other yelp review look like stk doe not honor reserv like they didnt honor mine

phew glad to get all that off my chest5 star last year what a differ a year make this year experi pardon my languag suck donkey ball let break down the formula for the san gennaro feast circa 2012 edit 

1 park fleec your custom to park sort of close or fleec them a littl less and make them walk halfway across the west side of vega to get a park space 
1a find the surliest most hate park attend in vega hire them base on attitud 
2 find the most disorgan and slow way of get peopl to the gate to pay admiss did the ice sheet in antarctica melt by the time it took us to get in 
3 onc insid run past the pushi merchant tri to sell you everyth 
4 pay out the nose for food no let take an arm and a leg too 
5 offer a super tini itsi bitsi teeni weeni littl place to sit and eat your overpr food think strip price but on the wrong side of i15 oh wait we dont want you to sit that would take up too much space we need for maximum monet of the event
6 let charg way too much for carniv ride ticket 
7 let your friend cut in front of everyon that wait 20 min for a ride happen 4x
8fight hord of rude stupid peopl who must have been born in a barn and dont have a freakin clue about basic courtesy
9 walk back to your car that was suppos watch by secur to find your mirror broken off and dangl and other damag done to your car 

las vega deserv a san gennaro feast that is in the italian tradit not the mafia tradit i felt like i got fleec mug and downright abus at this year event 

someon need to step back and rethink what the heck theyr do here this could be a world class event but the way it go this will be the last year i go back 

1 star post under extrem howl protest eek methink not indemy friend had free ticket  if i had actual paid the ridicul 9 admiss and then overpaid for food id be way piss right now the bacon wrap turkey leg sound amaz but eff pay 1650 that wors than disneyland we tri mediocr philli chees steak garlic fri suppos homemad ice cream that wasnt creami like non commerci ice cream usual is 

the one and onli worthwhil thing was the funnel cake specif from 1 of the 5 or so stand they had 6 and 8 but we went with the 4 mini trio 8 includ top like appl and cinnamon blueberrystrawberri w cream chees frost banana chocol bday cake smore and probabl a few other i forgot it has to be from the one next to the corn stand  the rest were flat and look like crap 

it was pack with probabl the most ghetto ss crowd ive ever seen in vega even w a free ticket i probabl wouldnt go back  i can go to oliv garden if i want mediocr italian food at least they have ac w free soup and saladso we were look for an ayc sushi place on a saturday night and call around to a few differ place in summerlin  a ladi answer the phone and said that their ayc is 2095 great price for the locat 

well we get there and there is no one in the restaur and upon further examin of the menu it turn out their ayc is 400 for nigiri  they dont tell you this on the phone and basic use the bait and switch to get you in the door  after voic my concern that i felt misl and lie to and request they waiv the 4 she came back and said the manag refus to author it  we got up prompt and went across the street to naka sushi which is not onli cheaper but also had a better crowd and ambianc  

do not go price are mislead and manag refus to take responswow this was the worst experi ive ever had at a sweet tomato it was my first time at this locat and itll be my last

custom servic was great but the food was horribl talk about carb central the option for the salad were great and fresh just veri unconvent that you have to walk all the way out to the front of the restaur to get more salad the soup were flavorless and wateri the chili had no flavor and the chowder tast of pure sweet corn more like a desert than soup yuck said potato in it but i saw and tast none there was pizza if you could call it that just tast like a bread stick and not a good one at that the pasta vey flavorless and cold the sauc were dri to them which meant theyd been sit under the lamp a while the onli thee option was a bake potato which were dri and over cook fail

th corn bread was good but that about it especi pair with the sweet butter

on desert was ice cream and these midget cone they were so small you couldnt put ice cream caus it fall off

th one on lake mead is ten time better and i will tell everyon to stay away 

for four peopl it cost us 50 buck it crazi it ten a person not includ your drink i would have rather had mc donald or taco bellmy friend purchas a cabana for us and thing were fine until a power hungri secur guard decid to ruin the day he came up to us and ask one of my friend to lift up her sunglass then said your out 

we ask for an explan and they said it was privat properti and they did not need to disclos anyth to us my friend was coher and civil even the server agre with us and told us not to pay ani gratuiti we even spoke to head of secur who side with that asshol 

asid from my person experi the water is warm which is pretti gross marque day club water is cooler id recommend go there unless your die to see a dj at encorpro
spaci  even for this sold out event
quick servic for drinks
great overal perform by all the djs

cons
secur involv with all the line were rude power trip assholes
serv for the cabana were racist and rude
secur on the insid were asshol liter push peopl around that were simpli tri to enjoy themselves

thi club was beauti and fill with beauti peopl  the onli drawback and this is a huge one is that the peopl in charg of both keep the peac and keep the patron happi were complet assholes

around the entranc to the pool are cabana that expens as fu and right so especi sinc it was a dope lineup for the show  when peopl pay so much money for a prime spot it understand that they want their area for their peopl and for other peopl to stay out  my issu isnt with the fact that these spot are exclus my issu is with the way that the server were handl it  i was walk into the pool to cool down and the entranc was right between 2 cabana  this was a common entranc and everyon was use it when i tri the server came up to me yell in my face say this is the last fu time im go to tellyou stay the fu out of this cabana area or im go to kick you the fu out 
i respond by simpli say  i understand what your say but there realli isnt a reason to be so rude about it  this is the first time im hear this and it wont happen again
h then respond with  im sorri but ive been tell you peopl all day and to tell you the truth all you asian look alik 
mi jaw liter drop when the guy told me this  i couldnt believ this came out of this guy mouth  my friend saw the disgust in my face and came over to figur out what was go on  and befor i could gather myself to respond my friend got me out of the pool and i went to my respect corner in this verbal box match that i didnt even have a chanc to throw a respons too
aft talk to my friend the server repeat how all of the asian at the club look alik and how he  didnt want to be that guy who say stuff like that   by  that guy  im sure he meant anoth racist white guy  the cherri on top was that when he was tell me friend how mani time he had to yell at peopl to stay out he point to my black friend and said especi that nier over there  this is when my friend simpli walk away becaus not onli was my black friend no where near the area he was patrol but im sure that if he he said that he wasnt that he would just say that all black peopl look alik too

so after that i just stay out of the pool altogeth to avoid anymor racist comment  instead i stay near our group stuff stash by a nearbi tree that was near the pool  after hang out there complet out of the way i felt someon push me out of the way  not like a littl nudg like an excus me but liter push me from the back into the tree  when i gather my feet and look back  it was red shirt secur guy that said that i need to get the fu out of the way  what was i in the way of  no one was walk by no one was complain no one was do anyth wrong except this douch tri to push his weight around

last issu i have is with the secur in charg of the entranc line  this was a sold out event so our entir group got on the guest list week befor to ensur entranc  our group isnt new to the parti scene so we knew that we might have to wait for a while but we knew the show would be worth it  when we got to the front of the line they decid to let in the peopl who purchas presal first befor they let anymor guest list in  this is understand and our group of 13 girl and 7 guy wait patient  dure the wait we had a bird eye view of secur get greas by line cutter left and right  the velvet rope serv no other purpos than a sourc of quick incom for all of the secur guard  we thought to ourselv  ok this isnt an issu it happen everywher  so we shut out mouth and continu to wait patient  after a coupl of hour the main secur guard  i onli think this becaus he was yell at everyon tell them what to do  said no more peopl could be let in through the rope and this must have piss off some if not all of the secur guard that feed off this extra income

so after wait in line at the top of the stair under the las vega sun  we were get ansi and decid to ask the person in charg of our line if we were next to get in soon  his respons to this veri simpl question that was not said in a rude fashion of ani sort was  your gonna get it but if you continu to give me attitud im go to kick you out   onc again we had alreadi invest 4  hour now so our group simpli shut their mouth

rud staff and will never come backi hate this place becaus of the owner pauli freeman  the secur guard we had rent a larg cabana suit with 15 of us david guetta was play and right when the best part of the music start random secur guard start show up to our second floor section tell us that someon threw a bottl we said that imposs when we ask to see a video they chang it to someon threw a plastic cup they brought over a paper say sign this that your respons for the 10000 ticket we refus they show us no proof that anyon from our parti threw anyth and they want to charg us 10000 fee and kick us out all we want to pay for was the 7000 dollar bill not a 10000 ticket plus it against the law for them to have anyon sign anyth under the influenc when we refus to sign the paper they call 20 more secur guard and even the owner came up keep in mind were all calm and confus when the secur guard came they just start push yell shove it was humili i have the whole thing on video and the more i watch it the more i regret not press ani charg the secur guard were 19 male and 1 femal and the male guard were push us women around but at the same time they want us to pay the fee and they wont let us leav at one point they threw my brother down and pull off his diamond cross from his neck i had to run and grab it becaus they were tri to steal it this was a nightmar i couldnt believ what was happen i cant say all the guard but most were asshol our phone were stolen our lv sunglass were taken we had a miss watch they gave us no time to take ani of our belong they arrest 5 of the guy which they releas earlier becaus metro show up and couldnt understand whi they arrest them in the first place long stori short we paid the fee which i regret till this day turn out they do this often it like a setup they corner you they arrest you make you pay a ticket along with the nice fat bill and they still kick you out and they rent out the place again within ten minut for anoth 6000 i will never return here i will never wear or take ani expens jewelryaccessori to ani kind of club
p if onli yelp would allow us to upload video servic omg find the owner slap some sens in them i cannot believ how oblivi some peopl are that let them think they have the right to be an owner we serious ask for water 3 time our food was deliv and there was no silverwar we ask for silverwar 3 time all while our quirki littl waitress chat it up with the bartend

aggress incompet tourist trapif i could put 0 star i would
im pissed

1 the wait was ridicul which is understand becaus it lasvega but it shouldnt take an 1hr 20min to get some damn fondue

2 most of the dessert menu item are inaccur none of the ice cream waffl had icecream unless you add 1 scoop of icecream for 3 a scoop but all of the pictur of the waffl had icecream on them  so the menus need to be updated

3th vanilla bread and red velvet cake that came with fondu were old and dri 

4 when we got the check we were charg twice for 1 scoop of icecream on the ice cream waffl after explain the situat to the manag he made up a reason for the doubl charg but eventu took it off but that it

5 the server was rude and after talk to the manag about the waffl debacl she becam offend  and threw the bill at us when we were gonna give her a tip becaus her servic wasnt that bad 

overal im never come here again worst experi for a desserttyp restaur the onli reason whi this place get attract is becaus mani celebr have been there but this is vega celebr have been everywher it noth specialthis was my first and last visit to this establish the wait time for the dessert as well as the qualiti of the dessert were terribl 

howev these problem alon do not warrant a 1 star review it was the extrem rude waitress and the oblivi manag that tip me over the edg 

to start thing off they charg my friend an addit 3 to add ice cream to this 15 banana split waffl which cannot be call banana split waffl unless it come with ice cream

at the end of our disappoint meal we look over the bill and realiz that the 15 waffl now cost 18 dollar with an addit 3 dollar for the ice cream this is when we ask for the manag who told us yeah sometim the price go up becaus it after midnight and it new year eve this was obvious a made up excus see as how there are no sign or warn post of this alleg price increas he later let us know that we were mistaken charg 18 for the 15 dollar waffl and he prompt provid us with a new bill which still includ the 3 fee for ice cream that accord to the menu is suppos to come with the dessert

th waitress then decid to put a cherri on top of our less than satisfactori even by grab the bill out of my hand and slam it on our tabl when she was done with it up until that moment she was get a nice tip but i guess she doesnt know how mani peopl would love to have her job instead of be unemploy 

as a restaur owner i suggest the manag learn to do anyth in his power to ensur a happi custom without hesit he should have waiv the ridicul ice cream fee see as how they cant be banana split waffl if there no ice cream

on a brighter note the hostess who greet us at the door was great

for tourist who dont realli care about food servic or qualiti i guess this would be an ok place to visit but for local who wont put up with terribl servic i suggest you find somewher els to spend your moneyahhh sambalatt where do i begin

thi place is great if you enjoy a clich vega place tri too hard to be someth it is not trendylocalhip it complet kitsch

 gaggrossli over price extrem slow and incompet i order a tea and my gf a coffe simpl right was out of coffe and who i think was the manag said let me pour you this remain half a cup to sip while i get you a fresh cup then she forgot all about get a cup of coffe walk by us sever time at the end of the counter befor we final had to stop her and ask about the coffe she look at us as if we were crazi so we had to remind her it was her request we wait until a fresh pot was readi and she would get us a cup no apolog no anyth walk away got a cup of coffe and walk back hand to my gf and without a word walk away 

if rememb to serv a cup of coffe is that difficult i watch them make 6 specialti coffe while we wait for a simpl cup of coffe for the manag to rememb she might want to consid a new line of work

we got to the restaur at about 300pm and it was complet desert this wasnt a bad thing but it was kind of eeri in such a larg sport bar we were hope to take advantag of happi hour drink special but their happi hour doe not start until 400pm 

consist of 27 wing in 3 differ flavor and an order of fri it took about 15 minut for our order to arriv these were the nastiest wing i had ever seen they appear to be deep fri and then spare slather with differ type of sauc the saucetow distribut was inconsist an stingi some of the sauc even appear to be congeal becaus it was improp heat 

the fri were just as disappoint as the wing they cost 369 and were smaller than the portion size avail at innout burger not as delici as ino might i add 

the total for our 27 wing one order of fri and two water was around 30 now i can think of mani restaur that i would have prefer over buffalo wild wing that serv much better food similar price this negat experi was exacerb by the fact that we came here becaus it was cheap 

tldr dont eat here if you have ani sens of dignitiwhere to begin i cant deni that the chefown is a reflect busi man but to put it mild hes lack in custom servic skills

id tri to get in to use a coupon id purchas for 25 dollar at least 3 time befor i actual made it in

attempt one we dont accept reserv this late the coupon requir a reserv 
attempt two were not open this late on sunday it was 7pm 
attempt three were not open do construct on the patio

in each attempt mention abov a man answer the phone and seem to begrudg my attempt to patron his busi with a tone in his voic and curt in his reply

th final time i attempt to make a reserv a woman answer she was much more profession and customerservic orient mayb she should be in charg of answer the phone hint hint

aft arriv i was inform that my coupon had expir 25 wasted
th owner said he felt bad about it and gave us a few free drink i was livid howev i felt a littl better after the pretenti european wine veri mediocr tast the salad was disappoint the chees overpow it i might have been happier with just a wedg of chees on a plate

th friend a brought with me ad chicken to his salad and got food poisoning

i think i should be forgiven for the onestar review the rate is well deservmy boyfriend and i were in the area and decid to stop in for brunch at first glanc this restaur look realli dirti and clutter 

a coupl of tabl were fill with diner but there were definit tabl avail after a strang and awkward paus the hostess snap do you have a reserv becaus these peopl just sat down and we wont be abl to serv you for anoth 25 minut i have never been treat so rude by a hostess befor she essenti shoo us out of there it wasnt even a matter of be seat it was a matter of be serv for anoth 25 minut which is not a problem howev after feel so disrespect we quick left and will definit never ever returnbefor everyon get carri away this start off as a strong 4 star review becaus i was stoke that we final had decent ramen in vega that other place togoshi that close down was not even remot worth mention i apolog but you peopl are realli reach im not go to name drop but there are great ramenya in california and new york as well as some not so good one in the mix 

montai was will to over look a few thing like the fact that it 103 degre outsid at night and you have no work ac also the faint smell of sewag doesnt realli get your appetit go as you walk through the door let serv a steam hot bowl of ramen in the middl of the las vega summer with no adequ ventil except for some ceil fan 

let pretend im part asian even part japanes and i know someth about food yes the food is decent and the ramen pork belli and boil egg noodl are decent not the greatest but good enough that i would have return price are reason until you start get extra our bill was 4400 for the 2 of us pretti respect check averag for a small establish 

this is where i am not understand how you could overlook simpl custom servic i have reason expect of decent food and decent servic 

whoever the arrog fk is that own monta 

1 this is not japan 

2 we live in the year 2010 

3 there are not enough japanes here in las vega a town domin by the chines korean vietnames and everi other nation that you can afford to lose busi 

4 treat your custom better 

5 you might as well save some money and switch to walkup counter servic becaus that about how use your waitress was 

it was not so much a lack of experi or lack of train issu but more an arrog i dont care it not my job mental and attitud what you dont think i saw this in japanes restaur 20 year ago even the chines have chang mr bakatari and deliv with much more friend and care servic is it that hard 

i order the tonkotsu ramen with tamago extra pork and extra noodl they serv the extra noodl on the side in a bowl and later i find out whi yes yes yes i know broth is cost labor intens and time consum to make but if you order xtra noodl then the ration of broth to noodl should be proport it was not even close i ask the waitress miss person veri polit if i could have a littl extra broth as i had a ton of extra noodl and no broth left im not complain there wasnt that much broth to start with just enough for the regular order of noodl i was serv answer was no no big deal i will pay for extra broth just a tini bit whatev you guy want to chargefat sumo kitchen lackey is like fn way and again no then a half ass sorri as she is walk away 

honest this is such a joke ive been to restaur in la and again ny that have the name and abil to be arrog and pretenti yet the servic is warm and hospit 

you can go to nake fish own and oper by japanes yet the servic is outstandill just get to the point take your busi els where

ev been judg felt like 2nd class well this is where you can be 

came here with a friend who recent had a babi and was on matern leav she had been approv wic and was alreadi self conscious about use it i told her it was noth to be embarrass about that the program is there for individu who need it and she wasnt abus the program

walk in we went around the store to gather the wic item and i notic it was difficult to deciph the wic item from non wic item ive notic in other store while walk thru such as albertson food for less  smith that they have the shelv proper mark so that when i get in line if a person in front of me has wic there arent ani problem i like simpl transact and im sure wic member do too

so as we walk up to cash regist 2 the ladi tell us with an attitud oh i dont take wic confus my friend say okay well where do i check out then the ladi say on 5 i look down the line and notic that lane 5 isnt even open so we go to lane 5 and wait no bodi came or anyth i tell my friend to hold on ill get someon to help us yes im the one not afraid to speak up as my mother in law call me a tiger she never speak up for herself either i find a manag and tell her we have wic item and she say that they arent do wic today um whaaat i thouhgt that was illeg you cant turn down a wic member 

mi friend get annoy and say meek let just go i be the eye of the tiger hha say no that not right she hush me up and we leav and go to a differ store

i be upset call for my friend the von headquart yes im not afraid to stand up for someth i believ is wrong turn out i was right it is illeg the man name mark on the phone tell me that the manag should have given us the item for free becaus it wasnt my friend fault that von wasnt accept wic 

hope this doesnt happen to other wic member if it doesn stand up for yourselv onli caus i wont be there to do it for you i love the nake citi sandwich shop on las vega blvd but we went there last weekend and discov it was close and had now merg with the pizza place insid of moondoggies

w went there today and place an order for 1 sandwich and a 14 sheet pizza at 1115  25 minut later my husband went up to ask if we could have the sandwich out first if the pizza was take a while to cook  the onli ladi work in the kitchen repli im tri to get it all togeth  20 minut later we still had no food  we wait 45 minut for a sandwich and a mini pizza  end up just leav becaus we were so hungri and frustrat and the ladi ran after us into the park lot

th loooonnggg wait time not to mention the fact that it now insid a dirti dark bar with peopl get plaster at 1115 in the morn make me not recommend this place  sorri nake cityyou have fallen from my good gracei didnt know it was a take and bake pizza 

i took a bite of the crust as i love a good crust and that bite was realli yeastydoughi i look at the dough where i bit and was still transluc so therefor still raw i grab from the other side of the pizza my 2nd slice without crust that was cook but still need to be bake for a better consist i look care at the pizza and the dough was roll uneven so the sloppi base made for the uneven cook like angela state about the sauc she had a slice with no sauc and i had a slice that i could see the sauc present without dig for it 

shouldnt have to rebak or watch each bite for raw spot when angela h and i were plenti happi to wait 20 minut to get a za but could wait longer if it meant not rush to get it done i look at the crust on peopl pictur and can see those are brown and top like pepperoni are crisp at the edg just so peopl dont think im just look for someth to hate though my review pattern is rare negat pleas look at the pictur i post a piec of pizza with all the top off so you can see the crust thick chang and the pale pizza crust and bottom im sure some peopl will say it just a bad day but uneven pizza dough and sauc is careless and see the crust isnt even brown but choos to box it up anyway isnt the pride and qualiti control id expect from a rave about place yes i cook some shit wrong made a new recip and it suck not for lack of care but inexperi ive cook certain thing over and over like you do at a restaur and can keep a decent standard on such item becaus i babi it and wont serv what isnt at least cook well 

 it look good smell good on the drive back home the top were qualiti but if you dont have the dough down right cook right then it isnt a fuck pizza might as well put those top on some sandwich roll so i can enjoy the nice spicey sausag bit red pepper oliv and pepperoni greas doesnt bother me too much but just a note there was a good amount of it to dab off 17 for a larg and the onli consol i suppos is the groupon also we got chees bread which give me vision of dough bit with chees we got a sandwich roll stuf with some chees most spinach and chop garlic id be cool with a spinach sandwich but it need more season other than the garlic so it was just aok 

the set realli dont help neither of us was awar of what moondoggi was about and part wasnt sure if we have the right place without ani pizza indic on the outsid odd that there isnt even a littl sign alright odd that it in a bar but i can dig it like how some  pts have roberto taco attach it not quit separ but connect to the bar situat but just a window on the wall of the bar where you can order  it was just an odd vibe for two ladi to walk into a bar full of men with a few stop to look at what we were do odd vibe and no real seat asid from the bar or pool tabl we hightail our plan of stay in and took it togo take a lot to make two loud social with all kind of peopl kind of bitch want to just go home instead of stay in a environ it wouldnt have been a place we could have comfort convers 

i dont get the hype i dont know about second chanc with this onei have to remind myself that this is bar and i am rate bar food so i kinda feel silli becaus it is bar food so mayb i shouldnt be so harsh i came primarili to tri the poutin fri but of cours also order a pizza we place our poutin fri order and it took 30 minut for them to come out it was a small order and we were the onli peopl in the dine area our server was alway come around check on us so i know it wasnt her fault for the delay so we couldnt realli figur it out was a littl strang to get your app at the same time as the meal as for the pizza it is sicilian style rectangular which im not a huge fan of becaus i like crust so you have an entir mid section of pizza that is all alon becaus i eat around it we order half margherita and half back home when the pizza came out it look good but as i got a coupl bite in it start to tast gross they bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of put it on after so the basil is wilt and burnt the tomato tast can and the chees was gross to look at after 15 minut it becam hard and form and the crust had an overwhelm tast of yeast clear not qualiti ingredi again i realiz im at a bar my stomach has been a littl upset sinc i ate the two thing this place has go for them is the pandora station they play and the poutin fri but id never come back and wait 30 minut for themabsolut horrible

andreawww phokindont dot com 

pros 
1cheap and tasti chicken banh mi it all about the delici bread i have to give them credit for that  

con 
1 realli bad servic the waitress could not understand slow and perfect spoken english to the point she was rude and short with us not cool consid we eat pho regular and know how to order right from the menu mayb it was my blond hair and blue eye or my friend bicep that caught her off guard either way i felt discrimin against not a good feel 

2 the pho broth well if you are a fan of mop water than you might want to move this to pros the broth tast dirti and just off which are usual a sign of a dirti kitchen

3 the meat in the pho where the beef there were 3 piec of beef nuff said 

4 our order came out realli wrong we both order pho tai and one of us was the lucki recipi of tripe big surpris at this point 

summari as the great c barkley would say that turribl  sinc there are so mani other vietnames restaur on point in the same vicin i will not be return unless i sudden get a crave for mop water 

phoke epic faili found a coackroach in my pho  it was a tini roach mayb the size of a penni coin

th owner was realli apologet about the cockroach  he waiv our bill for our parti of 7  he apolog repeat about it

i wasnt upset at him nor the restaur  i know it was an accid and they didnt want it to happen

im kinda scare what is in the kitchen thofor our first time here the entir experi was a turn off drink an ice slushi that tast like water with a splash of kale wasnt my intent or idea hey i get it they are tri to be au natur and healthi by use turbinado as sweeten or whatev but man should the smoothi also not have ani flavor 

i order the newli advertis island green  spinach kale mango pineappl  banana i also ad vitamin energ b12 vitamin c multivitamin  it rack up fast at 99 cent each i said the hell with it sinc i was feel under the weather

th drink was veri disappoint i definit expect more substanc and flavor from all of the veget and fruit it advertis no mango no pineappl no banana flavor it wasnt even natur sweet from those fruit and veget it was a light green color and all i could tast was a light hint of kale most water down 

it had waaaay too much ice compar to the fruitvegetablesweeten ratio they put into it it was not worth the 9 and chang 

other annoyances
1 we could bare read the menu on the wall due to blind glare from the light in the place the girl just look at me like i was crazi that i couldnt read it
2 the girl behind the counter seem annoy we didnt know the menu sinc it was our first time there
3 all around uncomfort vibe

i would tri anoth locat in the futur in hope that it not the compani itself that make terribl drink but just an isol situat with an employewhile visit my father who was admit to st joseph i had to get my americano fix the first day i felt like the barista was irrit that i had ask if they had a canist of nonfat milk

th second day i had brought a 2nd visit coupon from anoth locat the offer said 200 ice drink after 2pm which sound great the same barista the one with the mullet was quick to point out the fine print particip locat onli with a nasti attitud when i told him that i didnt feel right buy full price starbuck drink twice in a day he roll his eye and said oh well your loss

so today i made everi effort to get my coffe elsewher i usual look for the noncorpor coffe shop howev in this neighborhood it seem like the onli option for quick espresso drink in this area the starbuck pepper all over the downtown area

th staff here made me realli appreci the starbuck by my hous as well as all of those small independ own shop that i realli enjoy so much more
if you must get your starbuck and you are go to the st joe get it on the way not hereif i could i would give this restaur no point at all it was probabl one of the worst experi i have had sinc a long time i had been crave italian for a while and thought sinc this is so close to us we should give it a tri 

as we enter the restaur there was nobodi there to seat us we wait there somehow confus wonder if we have to seat ourselv mayb then after a coupl of minut a girl came toward us and told us that it would take 5 to 10 minut where clear in a restaur with a capac of close to 350 seat there were at least 200 seat still avail so i didnt understand whi we had to wait 10 minut while she and anoth girl were just stand there and talk 

then after 5 minut she final brought the menus and seat us ok the ambient is veri nice and it give you a littl bit of a high class feel but unfortun noth els in the restaur is high class we order a glass of red wine chianti for 11 and a pomegran soda for 299 

we order the bread stick that came with a marinara sauc and a alfredo sauc the marinara sauc tast like the one from the food court and the alfredo sauc tast realli dri and bland the bread stick were dri and not so fresh i have had better one at oliv garden at this point i was so hungri though that i didnt care so much 

then i order the eggplant parmesan with spaghetti well the spaghetti didnt come until i ask where they are he admit that they had brought me the wrong order and that he would bring me a side spaghetti but he never apolog for it and onli tri to justifi it by say that it happen and the cook is busi he did bring the side spaghetti with marinara sauc then i had like 4 bite of my food and couldnt take anoth bit the whole thing tast wors than a food court italian place marinara tast like out of a jar and the side spinach was just bland and noth special 

i was veri disappoint in my food and we let the waiter know half a minut later he is stand there with the manag and anoth waiter and they are discuss this about 10 feet from us then whisper and look over 

then he came back and apolog and ask me if i want anyth els but gave us this look that made us veri uncomfort to top everyth the waiter lost our credit card at the end and we had to wait 15 minut watch them look for the credit card 

we definit wouldnt go back there as the qualiti price ratio wasnt fair at all this was just a terribl experi and the manag didnt even tri to make up for itso upset after buy a groupon we decid to final give this place a tri even after read the review i took a leap of faith on this place first off we drove 20 min to get here to be ignor at the door when we enter that we had to ask after stand there for 5 min if we should just seat ourselv an unpleas ladi said sit anywher and toss some menus on the tabl without an  ill be right with you we wait 15 min without someon even bring water to our tabl we got up and left now i know whi i stick to my five favorit restaur 
if you want good indian go to taj palac that where were drive now where we know well get awesom food and great servicthis place is a health scam of the worst kind 

what make high fructos corn syrup unhealthi and unsuperior to real sugar the fructos this is whi we hate hfcs and avoid it and shun it for the unhealthi substanc that it is 

it curious that the general public is so gullibl that they believ a substanc made of 100 fructos is healthier for us than a substanc that is 60 fructose40 glucos 

httpenwikipediaorgwikicrystallinefructose

thi crystallin fructos they use is still a chemic and far far wors for you than tabl sugar 50 glucos 50 fructos 

as of januari 2010 the fda has not design crystallin fructos to be general recogn as safe

ani posit health benefit of crystallin fructos consumpt is fuel primarili by the fact that fructos doe have the same valu as glucos when burn howev fructos is process by the bodi differ fructos causal relationship to hyperlipidemia fatti liver diseas cirrhosi coronari arteri diseas and obes remain a concern for public health analyst 

person i avoid all hfcs anyway but the idea that a product higher in fructos is better for you is noth but a scam protect your health and avoid product the fda doe not recogn a safei wish i was write a posit review for this place as our fantast local tour guid said it was a nice local pub  howev my husband and i were complet snub  there were lot of empti tabl and yet we sat and sat  i final went to the bar and ask the bartend there were 3 staff hang out there if the kitchen was open and if we need to order at the bar  he said no ill get someon to be right with you  ten minut laterw were still wait when a decent enough look coupl sat at the tabl next to us and were immedi wait upon  huh  ok so i wasnt deck out as i had just return from a 12 hour tour drop plenti of cash in this citi and beyond but i was clean and present as was my husband whose confer had just complet for the day  we were flat out snubbed

wel be sure to let our fellow confer goer know it not the place to leav our money  im also go to catch our tour guid and let him know he shouldnt be recommend this place ill do that in a nice way as i think hell feel aw  with 5 day left in this citi we were hope to find a place that could be a meet spot for our group  oh and im a fabul tipper too  

way to judg poor ghilli dhu

upd i contact the manag via websit after our visit simpli to let them know of the poor servic  in their defens he invit my husband and i back for a complimentari meal  howev we opt to visit some other place with the time we had left  i dont think i could have written an imparti review after our first visit  i do howev appreci that they extend the offer and want to to tri make it righti bought a groupon for elixir back in april i usual alway yelp befor i groupon but of cours this time i didnt lesson learn when i final did my research  saw all the negat review i chalk it up to them be a newer busi  figur i would wait a while for them to work out the kink out befor give them a shot silli me think that this busi owner might pay attent to yelp  sure the type of issu peopl were talk about would be dealt with 

well fast forward 4 month to this past thursday when the hubbi  i final got a chanc to give this place a tri we walk in a littl after 5pm to a complet empti restaur i tri to push asid ani linger doubt  keep an optimist attitud the sign said pleas wait to be seat but the ladi behind the juic bar didnt so much as glanc our way or acknowledg that we had even walk in we start walk toward a tabl while ask if it would be ok to sit down i think she grunt or someth but definit did not give a clear answer we sat down  wait for her to bring over a menu say hi smile someth noth she continu to clean or do whatev it was she was do behind the counter  then final brought over some menus after close to 5 minut sorri to put you out 

she took our drink order water with lemon for me  a sugar cane soda for hubbi which she said they were out of bc whole food was out of it um ok he ask for just water with lemon too we also order the vietnames spring roll as a starter i notic that it came with a choic of dip sauc but she never ask which one we want  hurri away befor we could tell her she came back with the 2 water no lemon i ask for some lemon again  she came back with a tini wedg of lemon in a filthi littl bowl pic attach which i unfortun didnt notic until after i had squeez the lemon into my water  then i realiz we had no place set therefor no napkin to wipe my lemonjuic cover hand on i got her attent  ask for some napkin which she brought over but again like i was put her out

a coupl minut later she came back to take our dinner order i ask if i could have my chicken sandwich on a multigrain bun to which she repli that what it come on the menu has sever differ bun option list so im not sure whi that is the default bun for that sandwich i guess if i had want anoth type of bun they would have been out of it 

anoth 10 minut or so  she brought out the spring roll with a sweet chili sauc still no silverwar so i guess it was good it was fingerfood we ask if we could get some of the peanut sauc instead  she inform us that they dont have peanut sauc i mention that i had notic it on the menu  she said oh yeah the manag is realli bad about updat the menu way to call out your manag oo

w final got our dinner after anoth 20 minut or so cobb salad wrap for hubbi mediterranean grill chicken sandwich for me hubbi came with 4 grape a tini pickl  a pepperoncini pepper mine came with some mango salsa  no jokei count 7 blue corn tortilla chip 

the food itself was pretti good albeit a littl pricey for what you get im glad we had the groupon i wouldnt mind go back to tri other thing on the menu but you could not pay me to go back there  sit through anoth dinner that was as awkward uncomfort  slow as that was 

i usual dont discount a place on servic alon  alway understand that peopl can have bad day yes even a waiterwaitress  but when i see yelp review after yelp review state pretti much the same thing i get a littl tick off if some busi owner took the time to read through review  fix the problem that are glare stare back at them more busi would succeedim baffl how this place is still in busi my first time i came here with a groupon the entir place was empti except for my friend  i we order a coupl thing all were decent noth mind blow so when the groupon came up again i was reluct to get it but sinc my friend is vegan this was a close lunch spot for us this time around howev thing are differ again the place is empti the ambianceatmospher is realli strang a larg room with old ladi furnitur  couch and outdoor patio furnitur for their tabl i order the hummus platter the cucumb were soggi  wateri in the middl the celeri was old look as well they were hard at the end the hummus wasnt that great i didnt know it was flavor i prefer plain old hummus the onli thing good was the pita bread i order the turkey burger i was expect ground turkey but what came out was an actual piec of turkey that had been on a panini machin it was dri gross and ined i still had some money left to the groupon so sinc i didnt eat my burger i order a mango lassi which tast like crap noth like a mango lassi like ice and greek yogurt she then inform me that the groupon was for dine in onli and i wouldnt be abl to take the smoothi i would have to drink it here are you kid me uh okay i watch sever peopl come in after me and what a long time to be serv i dont forese this place last i know i wont be returnthe wife and i dine here for dinner on 8911 order fri pickl 4 and pork bun 6 for appet the graze burger 19 and the burger of the week 15 fri with both entrees

thi was our first visit to graze we had pretti high expect see as how it is the sister restaur of letoil it certain was the hoityest place weve been to and with their focus on gourmet local ingredi we were sure we were in for a great meal

first impress no reserv need cool they were veri busi which for a tuesday night was surpris but it was elect night and there was a ralli go on the wait to get seat was about 30 minut not bad but they told us 10 noisi veri noisi near imposs to have a convers without shout the decor seem like they were tri for an artsymodern look but all i could think about was how the metal chair were the exact same kind of metal chair you alway see in interrog room on cop tv show next time you are watch law and order or one of the other check out the chair youll see what i mean 

servic was slow mayb we were just impati becaus we were veri hungri  we were in a littl bit of a hurri we want to check out the ralli  after what was probabl 30 minut we were final serv our appet the fri pickl were a huge disappoint there was more bread than pickl i honest didnt realiz you could slice a pickl that thin greasi veri greasi they tast like someth you would get off a food truck at a carniv i didnt use the sauc the wife did and said it was good so mayb that was the trick in my opinion food is either good or it not and you shouldnt have to drench it in sauc for it to be good  the pork bun were noth like i was expect which could just be my own ignor i was expect pork bun like i rememb from china one buffet on broadway back in the day what we got look more like a pork taco but whatev they tast ok i guess not someth i would normal order and i probabl wouldnt order again  the wife said they were differ which is usual code for not veri good  at this point we were feel a littl leari about our entrees

aft what felt like forev but was probabl about 30 more minut our burger  fri came not sure whi it took so long for two burger and two order of fri  my burger was the graze burger fresh ground sirloin ribey  short rib caramel onion cabernet jus sesams seed brioch the burger did not come with ani top just burger bun  caramel onion it look a littl nake i thought now i didnt expect the chef to want to buri his work of beef art under a blanket of chees even though we are in the dairi state but a littl lettuc tomato pickl or even some raw onion realli would have elev this burger to someth special without all of that it was just ok the tast  textur remind me of a meatloaf sandwich which would have been fine if id order the meatloaf sandwich but i didnt i order the 19 hamburg 19 i guess i figur that i sinc order one of the most expens thing on the menu that it would blow my mind but it just didnt my mistak in fact i found it a littl salti and not in a good way

th wife be more adventur than i am order the burger of the week which we didnt hear the name of and bare heard the descript of someth about a burger with bacon limburg chees and hash brown serv on a play on french toast  she said it was weird wet and kinda gross it also was extrem messi the french toast or whatev it was pretti much disintigr leav her hand a sloppi greasi mess 

i know right now you are probabl think sheesh dont you have anyth nice to say yes i do the french fri were veri good so there you have it 4642 after tax  for some darn good fri 

not what youd call a good valu although after this experi neither of us is in a hurri to tri the sister restaur letoil which would have a signific higher price tag so in a way dine at graze actual save us money in the long run 

an expens lesson learnhad some time to kill befor the ultim pley date yelp event and id want to share my love of nobuo dark chocol mouss with green tea ice cream and sugar orang peel with my happygolucki cousin who has never been here befor so we stop by at 517p to find that nobuo wouldnt open till 530p so we wait outsid in the comfort patio

aft watch a coupl of employe add lantern to their outdoor umbrella tabl i notic the open sign on the front door so we enter the resto whereupon we were greet warm by a male host and shown to a twotop  i didnt like the energi in that room so i ask if we could sit elsewher and he said to choos wherev we want to sit  we were the first custom so we chose a fourtop know we wouldnt be take up space for veri long anyway  glass of water were deliv and soon we met our femal server whose name on the receipt reflect butai  when she laid down the menus i told her we would onli be have dessert and could we see the dessert menu  i wish we had a video of the look she gave us a look of pure distast as she gather up the dinner and beverag menus and said we dont have dessert menus as we onli have two and proceed to tell us of the mouss and the almondorang fritter  she walk away and as we loud discuss about our lose our interest in dine there she came back with napkin and utensil and ask if we decid what we were go to have  i decid to forgo our server veri cold treatment and ask for the mouss  after all id alreadi finish a glass of icecold water and cousin phone need recharg  

when butai place our chocol mouss httpwwwyelpcombizphotos0buxoc0crqjpvkezo3bqogselectrk8m1rxl50pb69c2yqqtgrk8m1rxl50pb69c2yqqtg on the tabl i want to send it back  where was the love bowl and present of the last dessert i had here  was she serious in present us with this stalelook mouss with crack edg and whose green tea ice cream had ice crystal on it  i dont know about you but the onli time ive seen crystal on ice cream is when it has slight melt and place back in the freezer to refreez  for me see crystal on ice cream is a sign that it is old  i brought the receptacl and show it to the male host who assur me that all of the mouss is made daili at 400a and see crack and bubbl in the mouss is normal so i decid we would go ahead and tri it if for noth els but to have someth to report here  the dessert was definit not up to par with the pretti bowl httpwwwyelpcombizphotos0buxoc0crqjpvkezo3bqogselecto9jiksbmobhcxoimsekqo9jiksbmobhcxoimsekq i had dure our octob oye in tast and present but it was ok  the mouss was still cold and stiff and it had a mouthfeel more of like thick chocol ganach filling on a cake certain not the silkysmooth chocol decad i knew it could be  my cousin had to warm up to the dish as the sound of chocol and green tea togeth didnt seem like a great combo to her i told her to trust me  she also never enjoy orang and chocol togeth but she like it in this dessert  

i understand that the knowledg of have to serv onli dessert instead of dinner and dessert which translat to a higher tabl bill can be a bit of a disappoint but whi must you show your displeasur to your guest  butai you were lucki that my cousin even left you the chang for a tip she didnt want to give you anyth and you certain didnt deserv it  when i told other yelp friend about the subpar servic and dessert we just had one repli she didnt enjoy the last time we had app here i think it was around halloween and first friday either  cousin and i thought it veri poor tast that our server gave us that aw condescend look after find out we were just go to have dessert we didnt deserv that  i am never go to recommend nobuo to anyon anymor  i even promis my japanes friend who live and work oversea id treat her to a dine experi here when she come to visit  guess ill have to find anoth place to take her  i dont want to risk get the same treatment from butai or from anoth server should we come back here  

sorri nobuo but i wont be returni arriv expect a great night here but due to the horribl sangria and paella mediocr tapa and lousi servic i left extrem disappoint 

i have walk by this place a few time befor and see all the peopl on the patio enjoy the beauti sunset and list to the flamenco music it just seem like a cool place unfortun we did not have reserv and so although the patio was complet empti when we arriv we were told by the host owner in a veri condecend way that all the tabl on the patio were reserv and so we would have to be seat insid that dampen my spirit a littl but i was still anticip an enjoy even with my hubbi and some good food to start off we order a pitcher of sangria to share and some soup sangria arriv first in a surpris small pitcher i could not believ that small pitcher was 22  it turn out to be a good thing sinc it was so bad neither one of us want to drink it it was by far the worst sangria i have ever had it tast like it was 12 cheap red wine and 12 club soda not sweet not fruiti instead of bright refresh slice of citrus and other fruit there were a few bit of orang rind and a coupl of piec of some other fruit that had been dice so small it was unrecogniz i order the gazpacho which was pretti good although i prefer it chunki rather than pure and my husband got the seafood stew that had a good flavor to it but the seafood in it was veri overcook 

we decid not to order ani tapa with seafood in them after see the qualiti that was in the soup we select three tapa to start with the beef tenderloin the leek tart and the potato tortilla the beef was pretti good noth special about it but it had a good flavor the leek tart was not so great but the sauc it came with was delici and we mop it up with the bread in the bread basket the tortilla was disappoint to me this is the quintessenti tapa dish so i was expect it to be great but it was rubberi and tasteless as if it had been prepar hour earlier and then reheat we had intend to start with onli 3 tapa sinc we had alreadi had the soup and told our waiter that we reserv the right to order more he pressur us into order some paella as well so we did now i absolut love paella it is truli one of my favorit dish on earth but sinc other yelp review had said to stay away from it i order it with some misgiv 

the paella arriv about 20 minut after we had finish the rest of our meal our waiter did warn us that it took a while to prepar but i was not expect it to take that long as soon as we tri it i realiz that it was not worth the wait as other review have mention it was way too wateri and veri bland tast in addit the veget tast like they came from a bag in the freezer section and the seafood was the same rubberi stuff that was in the soup the ring of calamari were so tough you could not cut them with a fork i had to use a serrat knife the shrimp had lost all of it sweet flavor and was just as tough the entir dish was so aw that we didnt even finish it 

so they were alreadi down two star for the horribl sangria and paella also while wait for the paella i visit the ladi room which although beauti decor was filthi dirti restaur bathroom are a person petpeev of mine so that had knock them down a star as well also the cheesi outfit the server wear and the overal poor servic we were brought the wrong dish initi and had to ask repeat for plate sinc we were share had knock them down anoth star the final straw was that as we were leav i count four empti tabl on the patio that we could have been seat at  overal just a horribl experi  i strong recommend stay away from this placemy first experi here was short sweet and to the point it was pleasur in other word i had been eager anticip a return

mi second experi was caus enough to never return 

pictur this there were perhap 1020 patron in attend and mind you twas about 115am when we arriv we had no intent to bowl as they have a spectacular look bar that actual showcas local artist work id give them more than two thumb up if i physic could for this so the idea was to grab a few cocktail servic was lackadais at best even though we were the onli one at the bar itself

th epic fail that we ran headfirst into was the extrem absenc of manag poor salesmanship on behalf of the bartend and the uber extrem of the  bouncer unfortun whenev there are a bunch of guy behind me yell at me to get out after the bartend has just deliv a drink i am go to be a bit frustrat by the way it was still befor 200am

ultim it a shame as i was walk out i told one of the bouncer that i would never be back to which he repli it no skin off my back for a servicebas busi in downtown phoenix to have such a blatant disregard for ani patronag they may acquir is simpli dumbfound i live a few block away and wholeheart want this place to be a go to spot for when friend and famili from other part of the valley and from out of state visit but if the bouncer are the onli voic here then i would prefer to give my busi to anywher besid lucki strikei went to the origin open of old world a few year ago when it was up in north phoenix it was a good time though they onli had 2 beer at the time

i had been mean to check out the new locat for a while now and final made it down there a littl bit ago

wish i hadnt the guy behind the bar was friend enough and help but asid from a coupl of nice poster in the men room that was the highlight the beer was thorough eh on tap the two six pack we took home were both flat with the honey beer be almost undrink the place was a mess

hop we just caught them on an off afternoon but i doubt ill be back to find outi shouldv known better when i enter athena and it was hotter insid than outsid yet i was crave some gyro and hummus and had heard good thing about this place i shouldv walk out when the host grab the last few crayon from the bowl for my son and the bowl was love garnish with dead fli bodi man im an idiot

i shouldv gotten up from the tabl when after five minut we were complet ignor by sever server wait for a glass of water but i thorough enjoy not onli the compani that i was with but also the dozen or so extra diner that join us by land on our napkin fork and face 

i shouldv sent back the dip platter that was final deliv thirti minut after order especi becaus i find warm tsatsiki gross hummus that separ into an unrecogniz film probabl sometim the day befor and the feta dip thought stud with wilt oliv but i digress at least my son fri were accompani by ketchup so wonder and distinct it had broken into a clear layer of oil and anoth layer of powderi grit but that probabl just becaus it sit out in the kitchen for sever hour to fulli mature

i shouldv ask for the manag and demand my check to be waiv but i didnt i just didnt 

i shouldv gone to arbias of a month or so ago this place has yet anoth set of new owner over the year this place has been call bella sarah bella lynda brother italian bistro and has had at least five differ set of owners

b alway keen for decent pizza i drop in on the way home to pick up a pizza with pepperoni the bistro is as unremark in appear as it ever was but the staff seem fine and the pizza was readi reason promptly

when i arriv home i open my door and my hope for my pizza sank befor i had even open the box there jam into the door of my apart complex which specif prohibit trespass for the purpos of solicit was a menu from brother italian bistro  in my experi the sort of place who ignor the rule for free advertis never provid qualiti food as they tend to be as cheap as the thought process that arriv at the conclus that rule dont matter as long as they can person or financi benefit

sur enough my pizza was burnt on the outsid sloppi and wet in the middl uneven top and general tasteless in fact it was pretti much exact like food has alway tast from this establish im start to wonder if the new manag thing is all a ruse to score some busi from hope who think the food might not suck anymore

th follow day i went down to the apart offic and gave them the menu and watch the manag phone brother and read them the riot act about trespass as they do with anyon who spam us a week or so later there in my door again was the same menu on my way to get the mail i ran into the mainten staff to whom i complain bitter about brother lack of respect for our complex and discov that one of the mainten guy had near gotten into a fight with their spammer who had claim to be author to be there befor be kick out the guy and i had a bit of a laugh and one of them hit the nail on the head those guy have had so mani owner over the year but the food has alway been terrible

if you receiv a menu from brother or ani other pizza restaur in your doorjamb rememb the lesson of this review and save yourself a lot of grief dont reward peopl too cheap to buy proper advertis who litter your home with their trash and dont trust in the integr of their foodthis review is strict for rebar becaus i did not eat at bliss i veri rare give out one star rate but i veri rare get terribl servic 

i came in on a busi friday night with two other peopl and i went to the insid bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom as a side note  the bathroom is in a realli weird locat so the line extend out to where peopl are sit at tables

i stood at the front of the bar and end up wait for servic for 1015 minut which is complet understand except for the fact that i was watch everyon get serv except me i was begin to think that it was me sinc i was watch peopl left and right get cycl out at the bar i final got the courag to rais my hand and ask for three beer the bartend veri rude snap at me say you will wait your turn i understand that the bar was busi but even the guy next to me comment on how long i had been stand there after that i left and went to the bar outsid the bartend prompt serv me immedi upon arriv and even bought one of my beer to make up for the bad service

i never send food back im a good tipper and im friend to server i am never a rude custom so i was extrem disgust with my treatment i will never be backcan i tell you how much i despis fate with all it pretenti snooti bullshit i should have known the second i realiz that blissrebar was in the same build that it was probabl taint from all the leftov evil

and so it is we show up and the restaur was practic empti there is no hostess or even a hint of one we stood there for mani minut on end befor even be acknowledg by one of the mani server who were rush around perhap serv to invis peopl the place was dead we were told there was a 15 minut wait or we could eat on the patio um it 40 degre  and the place was dead i guess well wait we go back outsid becaus there is zero point zero extra room to stand the server come back out and say they have two larg parti come in an hour but we can sit insid now if we can be done in 45 minut that sure invit isnt it

so we hustl on insid and make some hasti select 9 faux comfort food shit like gourmet mac and chees just offend me so i go with the veggi sandwich that sound innocu enough right the food came out straightaway  too fast for a burger to be cook medium well like my companion order sure as shit she cut into it and it was bleed and moo all over the place my veggi sandwich arriv and it look like a filetofish from hell some huge block of someth unidentifi due to extrem deepfri i couldnt help it  i ask the server what the hell it was 

eggplant

ohhhhkay then 

it was like tri to eat a deep fri brick between two pillow imposs the pretzel bread while yummi is total unyield onli jenna jameson can fit that thing into her mouth my companion was suffer a similar fate with her bleed burger there was mayonnais and shred cabbag and boil hot eggplant juic go everywher and it was goddamn ridicul neither of us got through even a half of our sandwich i wolf down the side salad just to get someth remot healthi in there after the onslaught of greas although i almost choke on the bucket of sugar syrup they call salad dressing

so while we are attempt to recov from this mess the server goe mia youd think if they were tri to hustl us out of there wed get a damn check nope no nada had to chase someon down and ask for it when it final came there wasnt even an item receipt so even though the total seem a littl low i couldnt check it out i was so over the whole experi at the point i didnt even care i left a shitti tip and we escap to the bar next door where the cute bartend gave us some free drink and we suck down innumer 3 vodka special for the next four hour 

just ugh in everi wayugh i dislik write bad review trust me i realli want to like ice pan

first of all it is almost imposs to find this place insid of harrah serious no signag on the casino floor i know this is not necessarili ice pan fault but they need to address this 

when you final do reach the second floor the place look awesom they had two employe make ice cream from scratch in cold pans

howev it take forev just to make one custom ice cream be prepar to wait a half and hour or more if there a coupl peopl ahead of you

lik other yelper mention the managercashierown guy is veri talkat while he seem cool at first he doe all this hard sell explain the calori differ between regular ice cream show you fresh strawberri etc after about two minut it get realli old he make weird joke while you are wait and tri to have you do all these bizarr handshak i was chat with a client of mine on my cell phone and the manag guy wouldnt leav me alon serious it is one thing to be friend with your custom but if im obvious busi on my phone there is no need to constant annoy me

aft wait anoth 15 minut an employe final start to prepar my ice cream i order decaf coffe with soy milk raspberri chocol chip and strawberri the base mix she start with came out of some sketch machin didnt look as natur as the manag was say it was about 5 minut later it was near complet she ad the fruit and chocol chip in and then ask would you like coconut it will tast yummi i cant stand coconut and repli with a clear no thank she continu make my ice cream and then toss a bunch of coconut in like it was no issu and said youll like it are you kid me i paid a crapload of money for this trendi ice cream and she just throw coconut in after i say i dont want it at that point i just took the ice cream and left i wasnt interest in wait ani longer 

on top of the whole situat the actual ice cream was also disappoint it tast wors than ani other regular ice cream honest asid from cut calori i would say it tast like someth i whip up at home in two minut definit not worth it

ok here come the worst part i read in some brochur they have after eat a signific amount of my ice cream that it caus acceler bowel movement they claim this was natur and healthi let me tell you my stomach was so bad the whole night i couldnt stop use the restroom

al in all save yourself the time money frustrat and bowel movement and head to one of the mani ice cream shop insid the other resort the cafe insid the bellagio have excel fresh ice cream with profession employeterribl servic had a bachelorett parti of 14 they took our reserv and did not honor it as they got too busi they did not apolog nor make an offer and wors did not call us to inform us they gave away the tabl we even arriv earli and they said we got busi you can go somewher els absolut terrible

so we went to 1130 which as a restaur next door to them and they were amaz great servic and even gave our parti a discount and free drink for the inconveni and terribl servic we receiv at brick1130 we walk in  greet by the bus person we order our food at 1140 am  i order coffe  ask the waiter for french vanilla creamer after wait 10 minut i figur it slip his mind  so no biggi i ask the bus ladi polit for creamer  our waiter over heard me ask her  apolog  pour the cup of creamer 

now im start to notic the peopl across from us had just gotten their food 35 minut after we order 1215pm we ask the bus ladi to check on our food she tell us the cook was by himself today  oh great  1220 roll around and they serv my bfs french toast cold  set his side order in front of me  so i didnt get my food at all love  my bf walk up to tell them his food is cold  the waiter told us it just came out  the food  plate were cold so cold the butter didnt even melt ha insult our intellig is strike 2 then he say  sinc we had not ate anyth we could leav my respons was good

 then come to find out they had a b grade by the health inspector  mani demerit in the past  they were featur on dirti dine channel 13 news befor the name chang  steer clear of this place to avoid food poison i thought it was way overpr for the portion size from what i could tell from my bfs order  it okay if it pricey  the food is top notch but that was unaccept servic they shoo us out the door for their mix up i thought we were more than patient with how long the wait was when it wasnt busi veri disappoint at least if your go to have long wait time  give out public wifi

 were sit down at the crack egg on sunset  rainbow  i wait 10 minut  our food was up they are reason price for the huge portion weve gotten coupon in the mail for our loyaltii serious cannot recommend the food serv here i was entic to eat at this new downtown locat becaus i had been so impress with the french fri serv at their south phoenix restaurant

th fri serv here were terribl my dine partner comment on how soggi and unappet they were and took them back to onli have them replac with equal depress pile of soggi soft fri his experi in fast food restaur manag told him all he need to know by watch them cook the fri they overload the fryer basket and never account for time requir to bring the oil back up to the proper heat the result is a soggi fri that tast more boil than fried

a real disappoint and an expens one at that most of my fri remain uneaten and the burger was greasi and flavorless qualiti control is not a prioriti here but they are quit effici at take your hardearn cashi am offend as both an italian from new york and as a custom that this restaur exist 

i should have seen the red flag fli when the restaur had onli one tabl and the footbal game on the tv on a saturday night foolish me 

it start out decent enough although for an empti restaur the servic was pain slow should it realli take 10 minut to bring 2 glass of wine the bread and red pepper dip sauc was fine enough not amaz but it was tasti we lord the eggplant rollatini for an appet they should realli note how excess larg their portion are our appet could have easili been dinner for two and no that is not a sell point it was lukewarm but again tasti enough the marinara was basic crush tomato satur in garlic salt with some basil thrown in my grandmoth is roll in her grave as i write this im sure

then came the worst part  the entre two heap bowl of sauc came out somewher in there was my chicken and shrimp carbonara and my boyfriend lobster ravioli there had to have been at least 4 cup of storebought sauc in each bowl within a few bite the sauc had alreadi start separ  how appet the chicken in my carbonara was clear frozen grill chicken strip perhap tyson that had an unpleas after tast the shrimp was slight undercook and still had their tail on normal this would be fine but when there is so much sauc to navig through grab onto a tail is not ideal the pea were extrem over cook and mushi somewher was my bacon but that was too coat in sauc to find my boyfriend lobster ravioli was also overwhelm with sauc the dish also came with shrimp and scallop but again the over abund of sauc made differenti between the two imposs 

to make the scene all the more sad there was a man play piano who for some reason decid to use the microphon to say he was go on a break that would have been fine howev we were the onli custom in the room at that point and onli made the situat awkward

im convinc the onli reason their portion are so larg is so they can charg 12 for an entre without feel guilti 50 down the drain  i couldnt even stand the smell of the leftov and prompt threw them away upon return home

to salvag what was left of our even we were forc to go to the groceri store and buy some ben  jerri and beer  two thing we know were get our money worth for

word to the wise stay awaysometh is now serious amiss at sfse i was abl to stop in on wednesday 52 and the first thing i notic is the illi coffe is gone and i didnt see the super cool owner i saw last time 

i order a garlic pesto sandwich and told them i want light mayo and mustard what i got look like a french mustard bottl and a contain of kraft mayo had a love child togeth and it was not pretti and it tast like well we wont push yelp communiti standard for write a review and you can just let your imagin fill in the blank 

after skim the review it appear ownership has chang and the focus may have shift from qualiti of product to quantiti of cash in the till which is a shame as what they had go on here was someth pretti special now it not even worth take the time to exit i215 to drive two block south to go to it tack on the stupid payment card polici see my list descript pathet fountain drink that make me want to call coke and complain direct and a glare when i use the yelp check in deal for free chip and a drink and im give 1 star under protest

edit there been some new 5 star review post for sfse by peopl with no previous post that could be legit  or it could be suspici im felt it was worth mention as this sort of thing can be peopl tri to counter bad review by game the system so to speak again that may not be happen here but it warrant keep a close eye on iti wish i could give them 0 stars

w made a point of visit pbr while nascar was in town march 911 2012 onli becaus of their pbr promot flyer  websit ad which read patron who attend the highintens race may enjoy a 10 percent dine discount when they present their ticket stub from the event throughout the weekend as well as a complimentari open bar within an hour after the race finish

wel we won our bet on the race yeah but as soon as they wave the checker flag we ask for our free drink per the promot our waiter told us the onli beer select were bud or bud light we dont drink bud or bud light  so we had a well drink it was healthi and we were happi as soon as we finish the first drink was ask for a second again we figur sinc the promot was an open bar for one hour  the servic would be slow and we would get at most three free drink well get this upon order our second well drink our waiter tell us oh it just one free drink and i said what

again promot read  patron who attend the highintens race may enjoy a 10 percent dine discount when they present their ticket stub from the event throughout the weekend as well as a complimentari open bar within an hour after the race finish where doe that say one drink bullsht

at that point i ask for the check becaus i was through with crappi establish and when i ask for the bill i remind them of the 10 dine discount this time our waiter said oh that discount is if you dont get a free drink  it either one or the other my husband came unglu i think i curs our waiter said let me check though you are my first custom ask for the discount

fum i sat at the tabl think about all the other bar we couldv enjoy the race as well as spent our out of town dollarth food was bare averag i had a salad and my husband had a burger and the servic was horribl from the hostess  manag waitstaff work veri hard our waiter return and said sorri i was wrong you do get 10 off your dine portion as we all made some sort of comment about actual do what your promot says

i am also go to review this horribl establish on opent too serious peopl  this place suck stay awayi believ they are not here anymor stop by and it a differ restaurcloselet start with the posit the food and drink tast great

worst servic i have had in a veri long time we order three margarita and two order of taco and the bartend charg us for six margarita and four order of tacosplus he charg us for the beer of the guy next to us when i tri to get him to fix it he came back with the wrong amount a second time still over charg us and the the third time he just ran my credit card without allow me to see the item bill i was mortifi and he extrem rude

also the peopl next to me gave their credit card and when they attempt to get it back they were told by this same bartend that they never gave him their card they insist for thirti minut and which point he said to them no one here has your credit card you have said that you gave it to sever peopl and you didnt when anoth bartend gave them back the card a few minut later there was no apology

z teja is right across the street the food is delici and the bartend are phenomen i was just there and without my even say anyth when the food took over twenti minut to come out they comp our entir mealbeen here a few time for happi hour and recent had a bad experi with the arrog all power bouncers

im 35 so im too old now to parti with the youngin after 1000 pm and that when this place turn into a night scene i was with a group of friend and we had just paid our tab and were leav short by the way if you order a 500 class of whiskey and you want ice they charg you 125 for the ice we were at a tabl and i start to slowli roll down the umbrella from over the tabl as a goof to mess with my friend seat around it within second a bouncer came over and told me not to do that and he roll it back up i laugh not at him becaus i thought it was funni i got in troubl and then sat back down and start talk to my friend about 1 minut later he came back and said i need to leav and yell at me that he told me to stop mess with the umbrella i was a littl shock as i did noth he told me to stop i stop and that was it for me he got in my face and bulk up and backup arriv and i hadnt even said anyth at this point in my younger day i wouldv been pretti upset and end up strike him get rough up and end up in cuff this time i was extrem polit and said i respect his warn and that i didnt do anyth but id still leav i argu with this for a bit didnt rais my voic just want him and the peopl around me to know that i didnt do anyth wrong and just said it was ridicul he then said you laugh at me like i hurt his feel anyway it click and i laugh and said wow i see your kick me out becaus i hurt your pride or someth i turn and left peac mayb they need a reason to kick us out so they could get us old peopl out and clear a tabl for the vip line start to form at the front door

needless to say im never go back i cant stand bouncer who take their power to extrem level and the establish that hire themoh how the mighti have fallen  i arriv here around 810am and was seat relat prompt  my order was taken and water on my tabl by 815am  this is where this turn from a great experi to a bad one  

i know that this is a relat small eateri  it a mom and pop type busi  the pancak were good  a tad too chocolateti more so than i rememb but i could have just been in a bad mood after wait 12 hour for pancak  are you kid me  im a solo diner  i watch full stack brought out to the tabl to the right of me and short stack to my leftliter  if it didnt take me 12 hour to get there i would have left  final my waitress notic hmmm i think she probabl came here to eat and ask the kitchen where my food was  they start to argu about if it was put in or not  im think hey im sit right next to you guy can you be more discret  so they start make the pancak  do i get an apolog an explan a are you still do alright your food will be out in a bit or at least some water in my empti glass you guess it no  that was the insult part

look i eat out a lot  i do probabl more than i should  i know that thing happen and mistak are made  that absolut fine  there will be some human error  what is not accept is keep the patron in the dark especi if i can hear the whole he saidsh said convers this right here is where restaur are defin and this place fail miser  to add insult to injuri they put the check on my tabl liter 3 minut after i got my food  i eat fast but realli  again realli  youv got to be kid me  

i will never eat at this place again  they need to hire someon to teach them how to run front of hous or at least get some mannerholi cow we had the worst experi here the one up in surpris was a million time better

first of all we walk in with a parti of four on a friday night and they look at us like we were crazi the love gal up front ask if we had a reserv and of cours we did not they werent veri busi at all for a friday night but she act as if they were complet swamp she inform us that it would be a 20 minut wait like it was the end of the world but of cours to us that seem veri reason i guess were just use to go to busier restaur on the weekends

anyway the wait actual took over 45 minutesdefinit more than doubl her initi guess whatev we were abl to grab a few drink befor happi hour was over so we were happi the bar was actual the busiest part of the restaur and their servic was fast and friend howev the rest of the place definit took away from our posit initi experi there

w were final seat in the normal dine area and had the slowest most forget waiter ever i also notic that the hibachi area of the restaur had bare anyon in it so mayb that whi it took so long to get in everyon was tri to get into the smaller normal restaur section p we just want a nice regular meal with a regular waiter that night but unfortun our experi wasnt so great

w all ask for water and the waiter brought one gee thank communal water lol he also kept forget thing wed ask for so we actual had to ask other waiterswaitress on three separ occas for thing that our waiter didnt bring we wouldv remind him but he seem to disappear for long period of time after forget thing he also seem to know whenev we were complain about him becaus he would show up immedi after 6th sens for unhappi custom 

now for the food i had seafood kabob and they were okay howev two of us had scallop in our meal and they were not cook correct i know it hard to cook them correct but these were just bad the rest wasnt bad but noth great either especi for the price

oh i think the biggest part that bother me was the locat of the restroom it was right next to the kitchen so it was constant busi with waiter traffic this is fine but the attitud of said traffic was what bother me the first time three waiter almost ran into me on my trip to the restroom they just look at me as if i was in the wrong place and of cours i said excus me they didnt say anyth just look at me and went around on my second trip to the restroom three waiterswaitress were stand in the hallway just talk to one anoth block the entir walkway i walk up and stood there final say excus me i have to get to the restroom one girl move to the side a littl bit but the guy stand in the middl had his arm cross with his elbow stick way out and didnt even acknowledg me i had to maneuv around his impertin elbow in order to fit through the tini gap the one kind waitress had made for me basic i was think wtf

when we were done eat after we had paid the bill we then realiz that we had been there for over 35 hour ridicul the servic was extrem slow and most unfriend the food wasnt good for the price we paid and we just end up be piss off in general after leav this was our first trip to this hayashi but we want to tri it out after have so mani fantast experi up at the surpris locat i guess the name is the onli thing these 2 locat have in commonwow wors servic ever  my girlfriend and i went there on sunday morn we tradit frequent differ coffe shop dure the weekend and look forward to their good coffe and crepe i love the screen door and intim feel of the place so relaxing

so we arriv and sat down onli to wait for 15 minut not an exagger befor we decid to leav the barista didnt even acknowledg us until half way through that time it would be differ if it was scream busi  but there was onli two other coupl sit down ahead of us i spend alot of time in coffe shop this place may have good coffe but compar to servic at lux and lola ill take my busi elsewher in the futuri have never been treat so bad by a restaur i take back my previous statement that the owner is friend biaggio contact me after my review and ask for a chanc to prove himself okay i thought whi not give him anoth chanc so i call and place the same order i did the first time and told him who i was when i arriv to pick up my order he ask that i not post on yelp what he was do to fix my previous visit should i happen to chang my review i said that i would not then he proceed to tell me that he didnt open his busi to be a 2 or 3star busi and that wasnt the servic i got there to me that basic mean he is call me a liar and i told him so he deni this i told him that i use to work at a pizza place and that isnt how you do busi he said that he had noth to offer me besid the garlic knot i told him that i order enough food that night for my famili to eat dinner and that  we end up hungri becaus he was busi and all he gave me that night was a shrug and said were out he again said that it didnt happen and that when i got even more mad i told him i would never be back again 

you dont ask for a second chanc to prove yourself to a custom and then when he come in call him a liar and hint that you would like him to chang his review and add more star that not how you do busi especi if you think you are provid 5star servic whatev happen to the custom is alway right when did it becom the custom is a liar if he say he had bad servic  all he had to do when i came in was say im sorri you had a bad experi i hope this one was better and i would have been a return custom as it is i will never go back not with an owner that treat custom that wayi have to say that im realli disappoint by amor sport grill my philosophi is if you put an item on your menu then your patron should have a reason expect that the item will tast good

i had the 3 meat calzon and it was so bad i onli ate half of it if you think about it a calzon is like a deep dish pizza with a crust on it i gave some to my wife and she actual ask the server if this was frozen lol the server repli that it was made from scratch so im not believ that the pizza tast ani better and im pretti sure i wont return sinc the restroom smell like they fire their clean crew a week agowell where do i begin

th park lot is insan 

the atmoshpher is good open kitchen which was fun watch the chef 

the employe were great friend and knowledg 

the food not so much we start off with the chicken meat ball had no tast and had way too much of some herb i had the petit chicken as my dinner this dish as well had no tast it was noth special for 1600 i hope it would have been amaz will not be back this place is just too expens for the lack of tast it offers

on a side note if you bring in your own birthday cake they charg you 100 per slice what yes boy and girl they charg you 100 per slice of your own birthday cake you bring inflanni whi are you so aw to me in the past youv been noth but generous and kind but late youv ignor me forgotten my drink order and the food arriv cold and a bit disappoint but tonight took the cake serv me sour beer and tell me like it or lump it

real flanni  we use to be friend but tonight we broke upi brought in a group of friend 6 in all for a nice night cap mayb a few shot of bailey for the girl and a few beer for the boy we start with your special we order 3 beer and a gin and tonic the beer came out warm and the tast was rancid yeah rancid not hoppi not im not familiar with ale but rancid flanny

i tri to tell ya i said hey the beer is realli bitter and you you decid to educ me and let me know that the 3 grown men i brought in were just not use to hoppi beer they had never experienc an ipa wow flanni we dont know our beer well we know when someth tast like crpand you were serv crp and we didnt much appreci it so were done flanni you can take your medicor food  your snotti bar staff your midget bathroom stall your steril bar enviro and that lousi music you play at 3 decib and im go anywher but flannicomplet uncommon for me to rate chipotl low but tonight food servic and prep of the rice  bean was horribl result in a veri poor tast meal   note just last week i rate this same chipotl 4 star and it was deserv but tonight make me think this place is veri inconsistent

i was third in a line of four peopl not a veri busi time at all  server was in a rush a inexcus whirl tizzi and she didnt steam my burrito well gave me half portion of rice black bean and chicken  it sat there next to the guy in front of me who had order the exact same thing and mine was embarass small compar to his  it was blatant obvious how skimpi mine was as the two sat next to each other

sh was in such a fluster rush that after pass mine from her station to top guy and then not see it immedi move as it was queu up behind the guy in front that she return to move both 6 more inch as if that would get thing out of her sight  it didnt but who care if it take a few more minutes

besid a lack of flavor the textur were affect too  when i receiv mine the tortilla hadnt been steam well mean it was thick and cold rather than the typic warm and soft textur  the cilantro rice is usual a highlight but dimish and complet lack flavor  black bean were near miss so their normal sweet flavor was semiabs and the cold thick tortilla dough domin the flavor of this burrito
mani of the tabl were dirti and hadnt been clean in a while

sorri i stop by  
you want to see the servic staff that made this such a bad experi look at the photo i posti must say ive never given a 1 star rate to ani busi until now but i just had to this time for this restaur we went there on sunday juli 17 2011 the food was actual pretti good we order the pork and chicken barbecu mongo pork adobo halo halo lechon and a few other dish 

i was with a group of 6 peopl and after we ate here 5 out of 6 of us got sick from the food diarrhea fever chill and puke i rare get food poison from restaur so someth must of been serious wrong with their cleanli we also notic that most of the food we order was cold except for the rice we think that was the reason we got food poison it high possibl that the cold food had some sort of parasit caus us to get ill luckili my pregnant wife was the onli one who did not get sick even our 1 year old niec got sick so not worth it

i will never go back to this place fiesta filipina cuisin pleas heat your food proper otherwis you are a health hazardi left with a baaaaad tast in my mouth and it had noth to do with the tea  the tea itself was veri tasti  but becaus of the sale push i never want to set foot in that store again

w deserv better than this even at mc donaldfirst off this place doesnt even deserv 1 star worst servic ive ever had

it was my friend birthday and his girlfriend plan everyth there was 14 of us and she made reserv everyon was so upset over the aw servic and food i felt bad it wasnt her fault it was so horribl most peopl at the tabl complain i didnt want to add to that and make her feel wors so i promis i would write about it on yelp

th waiter were aw horribl attitud didnt refil drink pretti much demand we hand them thing instead of get it themselv 
the portion were small and not worth the price everyon but one person was miss a dishdrink or more when peopl polit ask about their dishesdrink the waiter said oh not im sorri i will check on that noth it seem like we were inconvenienc them 

the food was miss thing not cook proper or enough and veri small the crab cake appet was small and not flavor well at all the lamb dinner was not good eitherw ask for medium it was bare pan sear and it was practic pink on the outsid it didnt even come with the green sauc promis the lobster mac and chees  the waiter  it amaz i high recommend it were known for it it was extrem salti and tast like box mac and powderi chees with two small piec of lobster 
cesar salad  dont know we never got it and were never ask if we still want it 

they charg us 140 for 3 drink lobster mac and chees small lamb chop and two crab cake they charg everyon 20 gratuiti it usual 18 but the waiter didnt even deserv that he didnt even care to serv us much less care if we were even there 

do not eat here save your money and eat somewher els befor go to the artisan the hotel itself is awesom for the ambianc but the restauranti promis you are miss nothmy parent insist on come here last week as they had eaten here in decemb and love it of cours i yelp it befor i agre to go with them hey my time back in scottsdal is preciousi wont want to wast a singl meal on a potenti bad place the review pretti much sum up our experience

robert mcgrath is gone our server confirm this for us
new menu that not as enticing
food is aw now
absolut terribl management

a review indic the place was good befor mcgrath left the menu also use to be good and food was good too but is no longer the case the three of us struggl with what to order as noth realli sound too great my dad went with a chimichanga my mom went with a mexican chop salad with shrimp and i decid to have a caesar with shrimp my dad actual enjoy his until later that night when he becam ill

both my salad and my mom salad were pretti much ined the produc was clear never high qualiti as evidenc by the meali tomato and wilti lettuc but the worst part was definit the fishytast shrimp how doe that even happen how old were these shrimp that they develop a fishi taste

th waitress stop by for about 5 second right when the food was deliv and sinc we hadnt realli tast anyth yet we said thing were fine howev a few minut into our meal we realiz we need to speak to a manag about the poor qualiti of the food especi sinc my parent had such high expect from their prior visit the waitress was absolut nowher to be found nor was the manag or ani other employe for that matter it took easili 10 minut befor we actual saw ani employe of the restaurantmayb they all took a break at the same time we were one of onli a few tabl in the place so it not like our waitress was busi with someon else

anyway we final ask our waitress to grab the manag for us anoth 10 minut went by befor the manag show up when he arriv we calm explain that poor qualiti of near all the ingredi in both of our salad and i told him about the review id read and how my parent insist it was so good that we had to tri it and that id hope the review werent true i should mention he look like a deer in headlight when i mention onlin review 

we express our disappoint but we werent obnoxi about it i just realli felt that it onli fair to tell the manag about the poor food qualiti befor write a review onlin about it and told him so and his respons was simpli your the first peopl to complain all night oh great the first one all night do we get a prize doe that mean you receiv food complaint yesterday and the day befor that were just the onli one to complain today which must mean our opinion isnt valid 

he didnt apolog he didnt valid our feel about the food as ani good manag would he just seem confus as to how we could possibl have these opinion but it get better he then say well the waitress said she check and you guy said you were enjoy everyth serious you can see veri plain that we have eaten almost noth talk about feel uncomfortableit was like we were complet unabl to have a low opinion of this place 

he said noth more and walk away he brought us the bill with the salad remov and walk away still no apolog we didnt ask for anyth to be remov we realli onli want him to acknowledg that the food suck and that hed do someth to ensur futur guest dont encount fishyfish and baggi lettuc it was nice of him to remov the food from the bill but there is just no excus for make custom a eat crappi food and then b feel uncomfort about not enjoy itnot yo nacho daddi suck ball big time the onli reason for the one star is for the compani i was with who made the experi pleasant and also for the 80s music 

we decid to go with the el tradit nacho full order for 1395 and were complet disappoint the chip were too thin to hold the heavi weight of tasteless top the chees was wateri and almost transpar and they slop chili meat on it that could pass for dog food actual i dont even think my dog would go for this bullshit on a plate the greas was swim around the nacho like a moat super sad face 

now the servic was not bad and the restaur appear clean doe that warrant more star hell no it all about the product babi and if you name a restaur nacho daddi you better learn how to make some freakin nacho hate iti had heard good thing about harold chicken and i was itch for some righteous fri chicken on this particular day i stop in around 200pm lunch time for mani peopl 

there were three guy sit in back perhap eat lunch themselv one man approach me and ask if he could help me and i attempt to order some food

h said to me i cant do it i have a meet im tri to open anoth restaur wow what a joke whi oh whi would you open anoth restaur if you cant serv food at lunch time with three guy sit around isnt sell food the general idea of a restaur furthermor whi is your open sign lit and your door open if your about to leav and not serv anyone

i would review the food as well but see as how i didnt receiv ani this review will do until im proven otherwis 

mayb ill tri harold again if im in the mood for wast some more time out of my dayive decid to complet write this place off and here is whi you should too

thre time i have tri to go here and they have been close all the while their websit and post hour say they should be open if one of you want to drive all the way here from the suburb youd better call first becaus this place cannot be trust ive wast my time and spent hungri minut walk here onli to be disappoint 

vitamin t will fail there i said itcan i give 0 stars

i walk in with my famili for dinner after have just move to vega and southern highland  veri small place i notic the probabl owner an older man greet and seat one server nice dress and a cook who was cough defin not italian  the furnish were ok the atmospher passable

now the fun begin  we sit down i crack the menu open and see all the entre are 1924 buck even a chicken breast with veget  ok you go for fine dine you get what you pay for but the price did not seem justifi base on the locationambi and realli we didnt feel like a 100 meal for the three of us so we polit stood and said we chang our mind

too expens for you huh exclaim the older man

wow  i had a feel base on his statement they get quit a few walkout  i just quiet ignor his statement and proceed to the door

anyway terribl experi will never ever go there again and i felt realli embarrass my mother and nephew had to be subject to such rudeis it illeg to have good chines good in arizona  we went tonight have high hope of have high qualiti fresh chines food and we were sore disappointed

w open our take out bag and the white rice had been left off of the orderw were go to give them a pass for thatbut on the flavor issuether are no excuses

th peek dumpl were wilt and flavorless  the sauc that went with them could not reviv them  the chines mustard was in littl packet and had no heatviagra needed

th mongolian beef was so salti it tast processed

th snap pea were stringi and overcooked

th general chow chickenit tast old like it was off an all you can eat buffet

honestlypanda express is bettera least you know what to expect in a mall food court

it wasnt cheapand im not a food volum person but the portion were smalli was fine with it becaus who would want more of this plate of shame

i hope they can get there act togetherbut i fear the owner may be in over his head

isnt there a chines chef in town who need  a jobi wish i could have written a review regard the qualiti of the cake but i can onli write a review on the custom servic at hottcakez of las vega i contact the busi owner regard util a live social deal i purchas month prior to travel to las vega for my best friend bachelorettebirthday celebr the owner was kind enough to agre to take the order for the cupcak despit her prior commit for the day which i was grate three week befor travel to vega i follow up and receiv confirm and sent one last confirm email the week of the event 

on june 30th the day that the cupcak were to be deliv at 5pm i receiv an email from the owner at 455pm notifi me that they would be unabl to make the deliveri but they could deliv them between 1pm and 3pm the next day unfortun i was onli in las vega for the weekend and alreadi had thing schedul for the next day i was veri disappoint as i had read wonder review about the busi 

i felt that as a consum i would have been penal if i cancel at the last minut and that this busi owner did not provid an altern option to the issu that her deliveri person vehicl broke down taxi are a dime a dozen in vega and becaus it was part of the celebr i would have gone our of my way to secur have them deliv if it is the owner other commit trump my order i would have at least appreci further advanc notic so i could have made altern arrangmy wife and i stop in to tri some beer on a saturday afternoon and it was pack we wait probabl 1015 minut for a small hightop tabl next to the pack bar we both order a coupl beer which were ok but not great

our server ask what wed like to order and we told her we just want to tri a coupl beer wed alreadi had someth to eat earlier she respond say shed have to ask us to leav becaus they onli allow peopl who are order food at the tabl be that the bar was pack and there was a perimet of 23 peopl stand around it that didnt realli seem like such a great suggest to a pay custom i serious couldnt believ id just been told to leav the establish becaus i wasnt order food that was a 1st for me and the last time ill ever visit or purchas anyth from that breweri luckili none of their beer are that great anywayi actual just left there and couldnt wait to write a review  i am so piss off for the underhand up charg  beer and bite my ass

i have been here a number time most becaus it is close to home  it is alway dead in here and the few peopl that frequent here are chain smoker  on the bright side i usual get good servic here and if your just drink beer it is good enough

i stop by here for lunch and a few thing rub me the wrong way  i order the chicken club special and a bloodi mari  the bloodi mari was 825  are well drink in crappi local bar realli 825  the chicken club special was bare edibl i had to drink 3 glass of water just to choke it down  if you are go to offer a special  make it special or at least better than you averag fare  

now here is what realli piss me off  when i order the special the waitress ask what i want for a side  it was impli that a side order came with a sandwich and a sandwich usual come with a side at all place like this  nobodi said anyth about a charg for fri or anyth  i get bill for the special and extra for the side  it is just a dirti trick  the special turn out to be anyth but special  

a basic crappi bar lunch with one drink ring in at 37  realli  then a tip and lunch for 2 peopl was over 40 

note to the owner of pts  you would be better off offer a better product at fair price than tri to profit off everi sandwich serv  you have about 25 tabl in the restaur part and i have never seen anyon sit in there and i can see whitook the famili husband 3 yr old son  1 yr old daughter for an earli saturday nite dinner out for famili nite call at 5pm to see if they take reserv  no no hostess tonit 
got there at 545 to get a littl head start we were 4th in line no hostess no wait list and wait our turn that took about 12 hr 
we were seat to then wait anoth 12 hr with absolut no acknowledg of our presenc it was a bit frustrat to see the tabl seat after us drink their soda and eat their appet have i alreadi mention i was there with 2 small children 
i wave down one of the 3 waiter to let him know we still hadnt been brought water nor had our beverag order let alon our food order been taken he told me he would take our tabl and be right back 5 min later after check on other tabl and not return to our we pack up the kid and left 
mani guest still wait for a tabl ask us if we ever got wait onnop they follow suit and left right behind us 
 never got to tri the food  just know it was probabl the worst servic weve ever encount too badtrust me i work at a chines take out place befor and this rice here is stale and day old becaus fresh rice doe not look off white and is not so hard  spring roll when fri onc are light brown in appear but refri one that were not sold the day befor and thrown back into the deep fryer turn the edg dark brown and greasi  some folk might tri to say the oil is just darker but darker oil in the fryer mean it not been clean and chang regular enough that it gotten to a gunki black color  it a troublesom process and it is true that most place do not do it often enough but u have to do it befor it start to corrupt the tast and appear of your food

th chicken and broccoli i had was not great at all  it sever small slice of chicken and broccoli that are coat with a thick black sauc  over starch and over salt  doe not have ani flavor at all  if this is ny style chines food then it not the nyc i have been to  my friend had their teriyaki chicken and it bad too    same stale rice with piec of oversauc chicken  he said after it tast kind of weird not the teriyaki tast he was expect  again too much starch and salt  and this is the dude that eat everyth 

dear fellow yelper stop short chang yourself  pleas stop accept fresh veget as a criteria for be good chines food  neither doe big shrimp crisp cabbag in egg roll big piec of meat qualifi as criteria for good chines food  guy u have to send me a messag if you do not agre and i can give u a list of chines food place to go eat at where all of the abov is a given and the decis lie in tast  if your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price that perfect fine too send me a messag and i can point u in the right direct to a good chines buffet seafood or no seafood  but pleas do not rate this place as 5 star becaus a 2 star is generous  i gave them 2 caus the servic is good and they keep the place pretti clean and neat  i think i am too generous alreadithis locat alway has a ridicul long line out the door  youd think they were go into a niteclub  we had some comp dollar to burn and for some reason both baja miguel and primarili prime rib had 45 minut wait to be seat  hell even the coronado diner and their terribl buffet had a wait  

sooooooowelcom to plan e  

we opt for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booth by the sportsbook  still had to wait about 20 minut for our order  the shake the server kept walk by us with look freakin awesom but i didnt feel like drink 800 calori and 70g of fat  save it for the burger i told myself 

final sit down readi to eat and were pretti disappoint at what dinner look like  it didnt get ani better after the first bite  the patti were thin and dri and the fri had no season on them  what a total wast of calori and fat  whopper tast a million time better than this    

what the hell am i miss  whi would anyon spend an hour in line for this crap let alon 20 minut  where is the steak in steak n shake  id rather eat frozen chicken nuggetthis place was an absolut disast on christma day 2011 line were long to get in about a 23 hour wait which was to be expect but no that wasnt the issu here

first of all i dont think they were expect the hord of asian peopl who would make a beelin for the crab leg and the carv station no insult intend  im asian and i have an understand of the common asian buffet strategi the line for both station were so long i didnt even tri for them 

but the bigger issu was that it was difficult to reach ani of the food surround these station thus make about 70 of the food veri difficult and unpleas to reach im not a fan of be stare down everi time i tri to reach for a serv of pasta chill out peopl im not tri to cut

furthermor they seem to be have a lot of troubl pump the food out in time to satisfi the need of the raven crowd the sushi station  i never saw more than 3 piec of poor made tini littl roll sit there the guy make the sushi roll  poor guy was tri to pump them out as fast as he could but it serious look like it was his first time ever the roll look aw misshapen almost fall apart tinier than tini tast aw the seawe wassoggi and serious if hometown buffet were roll out a new sushi station theyd probabl have more success than this

th salad stationbless their heart complet ran out of some of the chees by the time i got there and it was near the begin of dinner servic by middinn the wedg salad werent even wedg salad anymor they were tri to construct them out of odd end and piec of iceberg lettuc i serious saw one dish and it onli had 2 outer piec of lettuc that they were tri to cover up with dress that not a wedg man at least tear it up into piec and call it someth else

sam stori with the dessert station it was difficult to reach anyth on the left side becaus the gelato line was so long poor gelato guy  he was work as fast as he could and he was surpris courteous despit the fact that his arm was probabl kill him and peopl were order like 15 scoop of gelato all in separ cup at once

but the final straw was our offens waiter we sat down and i order tea for my mom he act like he was do us a big favor for free when he should charg us everi time he would hesit for a while act like it was burdensom act like it wasnt a servic we had alreadi paid for he would say

for you sure on me just for you 

like he was give us a free beverag on him at his expens when i ask him for a refil on my dad wine he stop wink at my dad and told me 

make sure you tell him it on me it on me 

hello i clear paid for unlimit wine refil plus this is my third time here

i saw him do the same act for the next tabl he must take his guest for fool nevertheless i control my anger and we tip him well becaus it was christma but i was furious

not to mention that we ran of water and it never got refil we had to stack our plate off to the side becaus they didnt realli get clear away

christma here ruin the wick spoon for me they need to reevalu their holiday strategi i still have a soft spot for them ive grown fond of their chocol cover strawberri plus i hate buffet crab leg but the one here were surpris good sweet still warm and not oversalt otherwis a complet disast avoid dure holidaythis buffet is good and i still want to show them some love but after i found a spider crawl in their belov chocolatecov strawberri you know the one everyon write about it complet put me off and ruin my meal imagin take a bite out of your strawberri and then look down to see a spider drop down onto your plate from the strawberri your hold pretti much a sure fire way to complet lose your appetit for the rest of the day

but i think i was more put off by the way the manag handl the situat the server send over the manag who just stand there as i explain i wasnt that annoy i was just tri to make them awar becaus no one want to eat a damn spider but then he just stand there doesnt realli say anyth and make it realli awkward likewa i suppos to make a bigger fuss so i can get someth comp i think it was his realli quiet demeanor and just stand there that made me think okay soreal you dont know how to handl it you could have just confid told me your sorri and will inform the staff about the issu i think i was more put off by the clueless manag who didnt realli know how to handl the situat the other staff is great though

hop this was just a onetim occurr but pretti sure i wont be go back for a long time blehare you kid me 

30 for chip guacamol and shrimp won ton that i can make myself

th concept is coolto have a place with mexicanchines fusion but i can go to carniv buffet for that

nextmy first one star review on yelp

im embarrass of this place i got some dim sum and the brais pork street sandwich  

if your go to charg such high price pleas dont have a restaur that feel like your in a fast food restaur  and pleas have better service

12 buck for 1 order of dim sum  outrageous

888 for the street sandwich  the thing was drip in oil it seem hazard to eat complet ined  i wouldnt want to eat it if i was drunk  it is unaccept to serv food that oily


im get upset just write this reviewwtf jose andr  i was so disappoint with this place  i feel like he just open a restaur with uninspir recip he found in random place and slap his name on it  

there was noth special at all go on here had about 7 dish and not a singl one excit me  definit passthere no mexicanasian fusion go on in this restaur except that the 2 menus and decor are intertwin it almost like someon could not decid if they want to open a mexican restaur or chines restaur so they decid to open both in the same space with separ kitchen i love both mexican food and chines food but this is neither here nor there two cuisin that are normal best in a holeinth wall spot and inexpens  this is just the opposit overpr and mediocre

w order everyth famili style and tri to get a good mix of both mexican  chines food

blood orang chile pequin margarita 15  i like this margarita a lot i dont care for the tast of tequila and the blood orang seem to mask this well it had a spici kick to it but not so spici that it was undrinkable

guacamol  chip 15  handmad and delici but the price is about doubl what i would expect to pay for fresh guacamol chip were light crispi and fresh

taco about 5 each  im use to dollar taco mayb 2 at a taco truck i got the tinga poblana and it was good but unless im expens my meal to work i would pass on this  much too expens for tacos

lamb potstick stuck on you 1288  6 piec  this was probabl one of my favorit dish of the night the lamb insid was tasti and i like the crispi lace sweet onion design on the dish would recommend this

sui mai 1388  6 piec  the onli cool thing about this were the gold flake on top the rest was just okay and tast heavi on the ginger at a normal dim sum restaur you can get 4 sui mai for 4 that tast better

dan dan mian 12  wheat noodl and spici pork sauc  this was definit spici noth that blew me away though at least the price was reason for the portionsize

col de brusela 12  these are on the acid side  tast realli limey i wouldnt get this again

shrimp mojo 18  8 piec of shrimp  225 per piec of shrimp sauc was good not too spici this was one of the better dish we had

bistec con mole amarillo y hongo 20  grill hanger steak with mole  there were about 6 slice piec of steak  again with the small portion it was one of the better tast dish we had but expensive

al in all it an interest concept and i was there for work so i was abl to expens my meal with tip and tax it was 60 per person  quit honest i would rather eat at a mexican food truck or a holeinthewal chines place for 14 of the price and more authent food with so mani other option in vega ill be go elsewhersingular my least favorit meal in vega ever  bar none  we had the full tast menu with wine pair  had full on palat exhaust and indigest by 2nd cours  so mani fabul place to enjoy in this great citytak this off your bucket list

iv never eaten anywher that made me resort to childish food snif befor i decid to put it in my mouth not a singl dish made me think wow how delici how interest how fun  i push most away didnt like the wine pair  most of which were twist cap by the way everyth was over sweet  l

we were just miser left exhaust by the experi which start out not with a warm welcom to the restaur upon arriv and an introduct but you want some wine     wtf  

cook techniqu was perfect  of that there is no question  i realli think if you do come here order a la cart must be the way to go  then you can creat your own menu of their dish which clear use love ingredi but are more simpli prepar and straightforward 

we are tough critic we get that but i think for 1000 check for 2 this should be perfect in everi way  and it wasnt  not even closewe went there for our anniversari last week

mi husband order the complet tast menu with wine pair and i order the 3 cours tast menu

th servic was horribl starv they made me wait 1 hour for my first appet and 1 hour and 12 for the second which they made a mistak by serv me my husband order it was a mini portion of a cook fish with the top be cook but the insid total raw i mean if we want sashimi we would go to a sushi restaur whi would we pay 400 for tast menu when they cant even cook a piec of fish so in 2 hour and 12 i pretti much had 1 appet and 1 cocktail 

on top of the aw food for my husband second dish the waiter serv him his wine 30 minut befor they serv him his dish so by the time he got anyth to eat the wine was alreadi finish and we were told no refil  for his third dish he got the food 30 minut befor they serv him his wine so by the time my husband receiv his wine for his wine pair he was alreadi done eating

it was truli a horribl experience

i was realli starv we were seat at 630pm and furious left the restaur by 9pm in 2 hour 12 ive had 1 appet and my husband had 3 cours of his 6 cours tast menu with 1 of the 3 be raw

what els can i say about this restaurant

w did not expect to get this low standard of servic and food for this type of restaur it was realli disapointthis is the worst dine experi i have ever had from the servic to the price on the food  the ambianc is nice as with most restaur in the nicer hotel in vega but that about the onli posit thing i could say  

1 this was one of those place where there are lot of waiter run around but nobodi seem to be pay attent to us from the moment we sat down  

2they call themselv a greek restaur but the onli authent dish we had was the tomato salad which i actual realli like  we order the babi broccoli but it was veri bitter tast i couldnt even eat it  complain to one of the waiter but he kept make excus for it and didnt even tell the head waiter  a good restaur with good servic would notic that a dish was not eaten and would ask if there was a problem  we ask the head waiter to take it off the bill and he reluct did but then made excus for how it tast again  i dont care at that point if it tast like crap you should accommod the customer

3 when we sat down the waiter ask if we want sparkl water and we said no regular flat water is fine assum it would be tap water but he never said it bottl water is that okay  so we get the bill and they charg us 24 for bottl water  same thing with the broccoli waiter made excus for it but reluct took it off our bill

4 we order the whole white fish which was market price but they never explain it the price was per pound  the waiter proceed to order us 4 pound of fish  i dont know anyon that eat a whole pound of fish by themselv  we get our bill and the fish alon was 200 for 4 peopl  you would have thought we were eat lobster and fillet mignon 

this place is a total rip off with over price menu item  i live in san francisco where we have some of the world best dine and have eaten at some of the best restaur in napa  those are real restaur with longev and good servic  this place is a typic las vega hustl reli on tourist who are never go to eat there again  do not dine at this restaur  horriblhand downworst experi in vega never have i been this disappoint in a vega restaurant

wa it becaus we didnt order wine our bill wasnt go to be high enough
wa it becaus we were the onli asian dine at this restaur at dinner time 

mi husband and i have been regular at the cosmopolitan hotel for almost 2 year now we are here everi 48 week becaus it dogfriend we come here and easili drop  on food and we were so disappoint on how this restaur ignor us for an hour  no exagger i look at my watch

w walk out without eat our food becaus we never got itaft over one hour

w made reserv for 830pm despit other empti tabl throughout the restaur we were seat at the worst tabl next to the hostess stand

w were not given menus what

w had to wait at least 1015 min to final get someon attent to get us a menu

th serverwher was he no clue he didnt even come to our tabl till twenti minut after we sat down

everyth i want to order ran out includ lobster and octopus  i told you spend money on food in vega  this is our second time here last time half of the menu item had also run out at dinner time

w never got our meal no serious we never got dinner

our server didnt even check up on the kitchen to see if our order was inturn out that it never made it to the kitchen can you believ it how doe that even happen

when we got angri and stood up to complain to one of the manag he went to check on the kitchenyup our dinner was no where on their radar 

we then complain to the general manag he was hard empathet  

we are never ever ever ever spend our money at this restaur 

mi easi go husband has never walk out of a restaur in fact id have to say that this is a first for us

go to stk in term of food  servic on the third floor stk is the winnerlet me start off by say my favorit yelper melani a just gave this place 3 star im go with 1 star i was go to go 2 star but then she remind me about the nasti attitud at the front desk  i walk in and give everybodi a nice big friend hello and get the nastiest look with not 1 hello back from ani of the 3 hostess just a curt follow me from one of them

strik one

next we sit down in loud drafti room with more attitud from our waiter
now befor i go ani further let me prefac what im about to say with the fact that i have been to the origin milo in montreal and the milo in manhattan both were great din experi but i dont know what this place is it more like a myli than a milos

i love octopus and eat it all over the world and have never paid 3200 for octopus of ani size this was an appet which came out cold  we sent it back second octopus was ined chewi as rubber possibl the worst octopus of my life

next we order the fish tast appet  veri good to excel but at 8200 for 16 piec of sashimi that they should serv with a pair of tweezer and surgic magnifi glass so u can see and proper handl the tiniest piec of fish u can imagine

bread and oliv oil r great greek salad was pathet with mushi tomato one oliv yes one oliv in a salad for two feta was of poor qualiti also so bad i refus to classifi it as greek it was left half uneaten we didnt want to send anoth dish back to appear like nasti tourist so we just left it on the table

w go pick out our fish a greek snapper of some sort came out dri as sawdust  that went back we had no choic it could not be swallow with out risk of solidifi in your throat like some cemetici  marin leak stopper that u slap in a hole instant stop leak water come out of it 
 well at this point no employe of milo restaur is talk to us just nasti look and attitude

w order dover sole and that were the onli word spoken ici silenc from the staff  no inkl of anybodi come over to say were sorri your extrem outrag expens dinner is suck so far

dov sole came out and it was good but no where worth the price of admiss when we were done with the fish we sat there forev it seem like we were in quarantin with the h1n1 virus
fin order coffe and no mention of coffe on the hous for your miser din experi 



i am give this a danger danger will robinson warning

avoid avoid avoid go put your money on red or black youll get more enjoy out of it then you will herei dont care how good yelper think this pizza is
a long as they have those dehuman long line to get food they are odorus cowdung to me

if i had this busi id realiz that the demand outstrip the suppli and follow basic econom 101 which obvious the owner did not take in colleg if he even went to colleg would lead me to open a second restaur somewher els to take care of the overflow

man i hate stupidas i read other yelp review i begin to thinkim sure we didnt order the right thing this place was a huge disappoint and rob us of our time and money 

we stumbl upon this place becaus they were the onli nice restaur still open late at the cosmopolitan where we were stay 

we sat insid a veri dark dine room where i could bare make out my boyfriend face  the music was blare and i couldnt talk to my date besid yell  it wasnt intim 

the menu is expans and rather tedious to look through we decid on a few sushi roll and nigiri 

i alway start with a miso soup 7 for a small bowl and you have to mix in your own miso past i mix all of my miso past into the hot water but it didnt blend in well and took me a while when it was final blend  it was not warm anymor so i was pretti much sip on room temperatur miso to top it off it was bland 

it appal how much they charg for sushi roll that come out in 4 or 6 small piec i recal the dragon eel avocado radish sprout  it just your typic caterpillar roll  noth extravag the eel was your standard eel and not even with a thicker piec of meat paper thin avocado and radish sprout crazi simpl and no frill it came out in 6 small piec and was 2175 it wasnt memor and i onli rememb that there was a lot of radish sprout flavor 

we also order the ebi tempura fri shrimp radish sprout avocado  just like your typic crunchi roll noth about this was fanci or special all i recal was tast radish sprout and rice 1475 and it came out in 4 piec  

550 for 1 piec if sake salmon nigiri we had to order 2 of them and spent over 10 for 2 small piec of nigiri the salmon was cut thinner than the averag sushi restaur it was fresh and butteri but there wasnt anyth special about it and not worth the price that they charg 

we spent well over 90 for bit of food here and there and lot of radish sprout and we left unsatisfi and hungridear tanzy

today you sad disappoint in the servic you provid i spoke so veri high of your brunch buffet with unlimit mimosa but sad thing did not go as plan 

let me start by say that although the day end not as plan all of your staff were quit nice veri friend and extrem apologet i arriv on time and check in and i let the hostess know that my dine companion were run late but i still want let them know that i was there sinc i had made the reserv  which by the way was cancel on opent after i check in but that is anoth stori   5 min later anoth dine companion arriv and we were seat while we wait for other  fyi there was a total of 8 of us includ my friend daughter kevin our waiter introduc himself and let us know that he along with anoth waiter would be take care of us score  we get to fabul men to take care of us we were offer the endless mimosa but were sad inform that the brunch buffet that was onc befor offer was no more and that a new menu for brunch was be introduc  i was so disappoint as that was the main reason whi i had pick tanzi as i had rave about the brunch buffet and how good it was  this should have been our queue as to what was to come

fast forward to around 1130 and the rest of our parti final arriv everyon was happi to so each other and kevin came by to offer the unlimit mimosa and again let us know that he and anoth waiter would be take care of us cool 10 min later we are readi to order and regret our waiter are no where to be found 20 min go by and we are still wait for our waiter so my friend went to the hostess desk  to ask where our waiter were and the hostess herself gracious came over to take our order but then we wait and wait and wait we see other tabl that came in after we did get serv there meal eat and leav we even ask a parti that was across from us who came in at the same time that we did if they had even order yet as they appear to be wait just as long as were were an hour and 15 min later  not kid we final say we are done i go and look for our waiter and say pleas cancel our order becaus we are leav 

the manag come out and apolog and comp our drink but we were still disappoint i am not sure what happen today but after speak your prais   you let me down as well as all my girlfriend will i be back mayb but it will be awhil serious  tanzi you drop the ball today

island style yelp page

httpwwwyelpcombizislandstylelasvegasqueryisland20style20restaurwhat the hell is wrong with you yelper who like this place  

a rare yelp miss but an almost unforgiv miss  i am tempt to write a letter to yelp to audit the account who post posit review for this place  your either tastebud defici or a friend of the owner

first of all we should have walk out when we saw that two employe were just sort of lazili hangin about and chat it up in a booth in the back of the joint  both look unkempt and disinterest thought they for sure were just a coupl of hungov colleg kids

at first i thought they must be on break but nope they were both involv in us get our food  whoever is manag this place need to get it under control  employe like that will kill your business

th chip and salsa are a joke  they are just sit out there under a heat lamp with a sign that say basic pleas dont take too much so we can save money  uh never seen someth so remark cheap in my life  even the sign look cheap print on some old paper off center and filthi  the chip were hard and seem to have been sit out for a while and like not fresh  the salsa was below averag and didnt tast fresh  i am convinc the tomato were out of a can

i tri their specialti if you dare call this piec of shit special the green chili pork burrito  again no way in hell was this fresh also bland and bore  the rice was room temperatur and the bean watery

mi wife thought her was just bore and the kid bare ate it  stay awayfirst i was born and rais in abq nm i realli want to like this place but

thi is not authent new mexican food fyi i order the bean and chees burrito with half red and half green chile

cons
 staff is mediocr and not veri friendly
 the flour tortilla are not authent  it was like plastic and not anyth like you would find in a good new mexican restaurant
 the green and red chile are not authent they look more like the chili sauc that you see in az rather than the pure gold that you find in nm
 there was no garnish on my meal except for a coup of scallions
 the bean were super salty
  the rice was noth special and tasteless

pros
th salsa and chip were ok
 atmospher is ok

i will not return and i feel terribl for have to write a negat reviewmy husband  i went to this place due to a groupon i found for it the groupon deal was good the food was good but the servic was horribl ive definit experienc better first the drive to this place was coocoo we almost thought this place didnt exist my husband thought it was a groupon scam but we final found it i kinda wish we hadnt though as i said befor the food was good but the servic was not it all start wthe tall darkhair guy that greet us at the door he spoke in a monaton  he had no person whatsoev   then our server a fullfigur blondhair ladi came to take our order  when she saw that we had a groupon she gave a weird attitudi look a look that said oh great some more cheapskat that onli came here for the groupon deal she had so much attitud she definit need an attitud adjust then it took so long to get our food eventhough they were busi it took forev to get our food we onli order some common breakfast meal my husband got the bacon  egg wsourdough toast  batter bite which are onli season cube potato that are crispi i got a denver omelett homefri potato which have onion  bell pepper wbiscuit  gravi the biscuit were good but the gravi was veri pepperi  had no sausag which it usual would have the onli good servic we got was by the two guy who kept check on us about our drink main but they were cool still we overheard our server curs in the kitchen about all the peopl who were come in wall the groupon i thought if they dont want peopl to come visit their restaur wgroupon then they shouldnt put their restaur on the groupon websit i would onli recommend this place for the food but not for the servicif you are look for just ok food veri rude and mediocr servic this is the place 
mi friend and i went this morn for breakfast with our babi and we had the worst experi shyla almost yank the menu out of my babi hand when my babi was onli look at it agh the more i think about it the madder i get some peopl just dont care about custom servic anymor we will never ever again return to this placeand i am share this with all my friendthe good

th hostess and waitress seem nice and the place is cute modern neat and clean 

the bad

bread basket contain squishi bread italian dont eat this kind of bread but they do get a point for ad an herb and salt the top 

 pizzetta margarita i dont know how to describ but the crust had that veri similar tast to frozen pizza not even like a bad pizza out and unrip roma tomato were place on top  the addit of some fresh basil top the pie but didnt save it from tast sort of cardboard like this was not tasti and after a bite or two we didnt feel like eat more 

herb roast salmon tast farm rais and was cook to approx well done not sure about herb but it tast like salt pepper and garlic just a notch better than salmon off an asian buffet  this salmon 1575 dinner onli came with what i think was the frozen broccoli cauliflow carrot mix you can alway tast frozen especi in the broccoli  if i had this same meal in a food court at the mall  id say it was ok for a food court meal but even fresh veget are serv at panda express and i dont intent go out to eat and pay for meal that are far lower qualiti than what id eat at home 

mi husband had the penn pepperonata and he thought his pepper were raw and said the sauc tast like crush tomato out of a can without season also the pasta was gooey and over done 


i do feel sick and sad for who ever own this place and i hope they arent like this all the time 
i hope they get help from someon on how to prepar better food 
last night was our first visit here but even wild hors would not be abl to drag us back for a second visit 

as a slight updat the owner contact me and said i was a mudsling and he said i had a goal in say someth aw about his placegosh i dont know what i set wrong in my yelp for not get his messag posted

i am not endors not to visit his place

h didnt say anyth about what i said about the food 
mayb i was there when they werent at their best
mayb weve order what they do least well
and mayb theyv improv sincei hope so
giv them a try

i dont know what to say to the owner other than that
also i will mention nowthat i left out we took our unfinish pizza home and it was pack sent to us all stuck togeth so i had to throw it outi want to retri in case i was too harsh but as i said befor they had unrip tomato that day so it didnt tast good and the dough i think might be frozen or a mixive given this place more than a few attempt to redeem itself i person feel that just becaus i had a bad experi at first doesnt necessarili mean itll be bad the second or third time couldv been a hiccup of sort or poor staff

that be said my latest adventur was noth short of a dissast sound a bit dramat i know but let me explain i walk in look around place is empti and there no hostess or a sign that say seat yourselfnoth my boyfriend and i look at eachoth and shrug so we find a cozi spot in a boothtabl it was a chilli even and some italian comfort food sound pretti good to me funni thing is my boyfriend warn me we should have gone to oliv garden or someth but i didnt want to drive far 

about 810 minut go by and a waitress who look like she was not enjoy her day look at us and sigh heavili i look at my watch to check if perhap we came in right befor close time i know i would hate it as a server therefor i tri to never do that it was 830 

i shrug it off think shes just have a bad day so im super nice to her and ask her how her day wasfin ok i get it cool i ask for some cheesi bread for starter and a diet coke i know it bad for you and i dont drink it often but i was in the mood for one and so was my bf she ask us if we were readi to order our dinner i said no and she say well just holler at me when your readi k

a i watch them build my burrito my heart sank and i knew i wasnt go to be in for a pleasant experi the meat was wet bean were swim in goo and the tortilla split from the wet as they wrap it my wife bean and chees burrito was even wors  485 rice 485 wet bean 1 of a tini sprinkl of cheese

when we went to eat our meal the burrito were predict soggi vagu unpleas tast  revolt bean  and general yucki i found it just edibl and would rate the place 1 and a half star overal round down becaus it a bit overpr and i just didnt enjoy the tastthis was the first time i had a bad experi at this locat but it was so frustrat 

i inform associ 1 that i was order a salad befor i could say anyth els he proceed to throw a tortilla on the flattop with chees when he walk back i had to inform him that i didnt want chees he just look at me then turn around throw a contain on the tortilla and turn back around tri to be help i ask my fiancé what he was order and it was also a salad so i told associ 1 that he would take that tortilla no respons oookay so i quick tell him im have a vegetarian salad befor he could assum anyth els also sinc it was thursday there was a tamal meal special that i hadnt tri i want to give them a whirl so i ask associ 1 if i could order one as a side item sinc i didnt want the meal he seem confus and i ask a coupl differ way but he eventu answer yes 

then it on to associ 2 she seem nice enough until i ask her a question then she appear obvious annoy i say yes to all the veget but no chees she ask me what type of dress i want and as im attempt to formul a sentenc to indic the dress that is veganfriend i couldnt rememb the name of either of them and she didnt tell me what they were but just kept ask me which one i want she start scoop the creami one into a cup im like um ah uh i meant the other oneth vegan one while tri to point through the glass it vinaigrett right then she just toss it haphazard to associ 3 but it land in the tortilla strip compart nice 

while shes finish up i began to wonder where was my tamal

cashi if you dont want it that fine we can make anoth one
seri whi would you bring it over with chees on it and then ask me or better whi didnt anyon bother to ask associ 1 or associ 2 about how i had order the first tamal just a coupl minut prior

so 25 and one disgust tamal later i didnt finish my food and ieft feel disappoint and dissatisfi realli two tamal and two salad for 25 with bad servic no thank you addit for a salad i typic love i had absolut no desir to eat it tonight nor will i want to again in the futur for an establish that has the appear of promot vegetarian and vegan option it seem to be a bother to everi associ to request no chees melt on the tortilla and no cojita chees and cilantro which associ 2 also didnt bother to ask me if i want or not top my salad if i hadnt receiv such amaz servic in the past where associ have ask me whether or not i want certain item or concern themselv with what i want on my meal then this experi wouldnt have stood out so muchtrailer trash phoenix now have a home this place smell of urin but of which the aroma candl that are burn cannot cover the local with no tast in music the songlist is all over the place with no sens of direct bare and lack the decor is in major need of the fab 5 from nyc im sorta afraid of even tri the food beach theme in the middl of the desert get the pictur someon mention an open mike night but not gonna stick around here im too afraid of what ill see too mani peopl wear sweat pant for my like and the woman next to me at the bar is use a hand stapler that the barkeep loan out so she could fix her shoe
did i mention the drink are dirt cheapi see no reason to ever eat here again   they add noth to the eat scene anywher and in fact tremend detract from it 

becaus of this place im go to have to add to my list of sign you need to eat somewher els   

rule  if there are photograph of the food on the wall at an american restaur your probabl in the wrong place   to be sure the qualiti of the photographi will be invers proport to the qualiti of the food  if the guy son made it with a point and shoot stay  if there was a contract to industri light and magic as must have been the case here leav immedi  

rule  the number of regist trademark you encount  is invers proport to how long you should stay  jimmi john has like 17 trademark on their name alon  the joke must be on themtheir lawyer have con them into spend a fortun to protect a concept nobodi in their right mind would ever steal  

i pour over their menu befor decid on the bootlegg club  mayb i was hope with a name like that it might border on the cut edg mayb itd be so good itd be illeg  

i told them what i want  i said everyth but onion twice and list the specif ingredi twice  yes i did want oregano  that five time now  

the sandwich was the biggest culinari disappoint in recent memori  if your wonder how they sell sandwich for cheap it by put noth on them that worth anyth  

im look at the pictur of a sandwich on the wall while i attempt to figur out what the hell i got  this isnt just mcdonald dress up a shellack hunk of ceram for their marketingjimmi john is a blatant lie

th sandwich on the wall was overflow with meat  mine was overflow with iceberg lettuc  the wall sandwich had mani slice of meat mine had about two  
  
the onli thing that had ani flavor in my sandwich was the spartan accompani of mustard  

when i ate it i was miss yaz deli the immigrantfamilyrun standbi  when i work in the same build  he got all his shit from costco and put togeth a meal with four time the valu this place ever could  that guy spoke a hundr word of english but never onc remot fuck up my order like i got here  

i was miss subway and i didnt know that was possibl  subway wouldnt have been the wast of money jimmi john is  

i might have even justifi my singl star becaus this place doe keep mani peopl employ two that were extrem good look  it overflow with attitud and gourmet and instruct to enjoy myself but i just cannot fathom how i am suppos to

ther are far better potenti use of the space it occupi in the build  it not worth the salestax revenu to a cashstrap citi  it is a travesti that it occupi such a signific corner downtown  your money should be spent elsewher 

experi is what you get when you didnt get what you want   read a sign on the wall  i will let all the iron volum of bullshit in that speak for itself  

2 out of 10é i dont want to predispos you but if you like true good food é doesnt have it 

from 20 someth dish mayb 5 were veri good most of them averag some too salti or bland or undercookedjust noth special which make me think about how peopl would rate the food if it was serv at a random place like a food court or food truck or something

aft my experi at é the concept i have now is a big mixtur of flavor from all the dish be serv so fast and didnt connect 

so for the food  i would not recommend special for 250 pp 

if you want the experi  i have mix feel you should go just out of curios if you consid an experi watch 2 peopl use tweezer to plate your food becaus they dont cook in front of you they just plate the chef is not creat hes just perform but more like a robot

th worst part is the pace too rush and on a schedul i eat slower than most peopl and server were liter look over to see when i finish my dish becaus i was alway the last one to start take the plate away i could feel their eye on me 

so in other word i would not recommend im sure there are mani better place in las vega for that price or less noth like enjoy dinner in good compani and be abl to savor your food1 locat is great see i live a few block away

2 the actual build feel like a shoe box  it so small you can hear everyth that is go onand dure the summer it is super hot in here

3 the six time ive had coffe here ive onli enjoy it onceit either bitter which mean it might be too strongor it cheap coffeeand they dont clean the machin as often 

4 the menu is smalljust like the building

5 and most annoy is the new mexican burritoim a new mexicandiscov born and rais and you can bet my chile is real new mexican chile not from a can

6 if your not a regular dont expect custom servicetoday they forgot my drink after ten minut we said we would go outsid an the guy said oh yeah your coffeew sat out for six minut he came out and said what was the other thing you order granola and yogurtoh yeahfiv minut later i had both

thi place has great review becaus this area is starv for everythingmost of the restaur in the area have 35 star or betterif you want to open a food est this is the neighborhood to do it wish starbuck would open on the corner lotif you go to the place and spend hundr of  over the cours of a coupl yearsdont expect more the 5 off your second bottl on tuesdayeven if the onlin ad doesnt mention that
and if  you complainyou will be thrown out and polic called
pathetic

veri rude owner
enough saidim write this to warn potenti visitor to avoid the ravella and actual lake las vega in general the entir area is depress with veri littl activ it pick up on weekend mani of the shop in the villag have gone out of busi or soon will the ravella is not a 4star properti more like 3  we had horribl servic here from almost everi depart 

we book a packag and both the photosdescript they provid as well as those on the ravella web site make the area and resort look wonder we assum sinc the hotel use to be the ritz that it would be nice and offer excel servic henc the reason we book it have stay on the strip most everi other visit we were readi for a chang i onli wish i had done some research on the area first search the web for lake las vega foreclosur and youll get more inform than you probabl want 

here a histori of the open of the ravella it use to be the ritz lake las vega for at least 5 year in 2009 the properti got foreclos upon actual so did the entir lake las vega develop it is now own by deutsch bank group interest note this is the same group that own the cosmopolitan hotel on the strip which was also foreclos on prior to open from what ive read onlin the bank has no interest in run hotel but has been forc into it no one will buy the hotel from them after the ritz left the hotel was empti for almost a year befor open up under the ravella name in februari of this year 11 it is now be manag by the dolc hotel group

a for the specif issu we encount ive post a detail review on tripadvisor should you want to learn more about our experi yelp limit the amount of charact for it reviews

in short i recommend that you avoid this hotel as well as lake las vega in general dont make the same mistak we didjust came back from a one night stay at the ravella at lake las vega  serious this is a strang resort  onc you start walk around you begin to notic the fake lawn in the italian courtyard the broken ceil tile in the walk way  empti storefront in the faux villag etc  my son and i order two sandwich from the restaur and he ask for a beer  the waitress said they onli serv soft drink and juic  not true  two other patron were drink beer  we ask the waitress whi them and not us she repli that she would have to go upstair to get it  the follow day i was kind of itchi but was anxious to go home  at home i found the itch were caus by littl bed bug bite all over my belli  serious this is not the place to stay in unless you want to be be remind of the bad economi that exist in las vega insult by waiter and bitten by bed bugwow  havent ani of you ever tri the street taco  taco jalisco or los taquito  the amount of love this place is get is unfathomable

i normal dont write too mani negat review  i like to promot and support  the place i like and leav the one i dont like out of sight and out of mind  but i just got back from lunch  atoyac and im piss  all you posit review have let me down big time  the street taco had zero flavor and the sauc were lack in both flavor and kick  i sampl the chicken pastor carn chorizo and fish  and they all came up way short  im not go back ever

i will now attempt to theoriz whi this place enjoy such a posit buzz

it in an edgi locat and qualifi as a genuin holeinthewal joint that peopl are just ach to love regardless of the qualiti of the food  for whatev reason peopl want to love shit hole but the food is sooo good and promot them to their friend  it realli weird

im embarrass for all of you that think these are even good street taco let alon the best street taco in phx  i will end this review the way i start it  by suggest that all of you go to taco jalisco or los taquito instead of taco atoyacsad the food is realli delici at the arrog butcher but wait 15 hour for our meal then subsequ find a hair on the plate was truli unaccept  you will not be see me again arrog butcher and i would not be abl to recommend this place due to the fact that they onli want to compens us with a 6 dessert realli that all you can do for a 100 dinner appal 

we wait over an hour an a half for a medium rare filet mignon and a hamburg then onc we were eat there was a hair under the cream spinach on the filet mignon plate my hair is brown and cur and 6 inch long my companion hair is blond and about 3 inch long the hair on the plate was black and thick and about 15inch long yet you refus to comp us anyth but a 6 dessert realli realli arrog indeuhon question

what the hell happen to naga

it been a late night work and person wise for my famili and i and we had not come up with a dinner idea needless to say at 845 i did not feel like start to cook dinner

i look on their websit and they state that they do their last seat at 930 perfect we will arriv there befor that

w walk in and there are four other parti dine it doe take one girl a consider amount of time to even notic us come through the doorwhich is pretti interest to me becaus when the door is open you hear all the traffic and nois from the yogurt place next door we almost consid seat ourselves

th girl that we have never seen befor hand us our menus and walk away doesnt offer us water silverwar or even a napkin we are approach by a differ girl also one that we have never seen befor she take our drink order 

mi guy order a beer and i order a soda she come back with the soda that flat and inform us that they are out of beer we ask for water and extra ice onli one water come so i guess ill just suck on these ice cubes

w order and she ask how we want it put in i couldnt even understand hersh was mumbl someth about food speed my guy just said what ever is quicker we had ask for just one bowl of their chili sauc to go with their crunchi that they serv i mean the four littl space on the combin plate is cute but you cant accomplish scoop ani up

wel we wait over fifteen minut for water refil and crunchi no one come by to check on us they are in their own littl world the other parti still dine actual had to walk up to their counter with their glass and physic ask for a refil i mean serious my guy want to get up and walk outwhi pay to be ignor i convinc him to stay

our food appet came out but we still didnt have ani silverwar or napkin i guess my guy was suppos to eat his curri with his hands

w re ask for water and our crunchi with sauc we ask the origin girl who seat us if we could have silverwar and napkin she said suresh never brought us any

our waitress did end up bring us 2 fork and 2 napkin the paper one that is i look around and saw that other tabl had black cloth napkin use so we got one paper napkin for the two of us and our babi gee thank but i wipe my bun with more paper than thissorri if that tmi

th food was good ive had better at naga person ive been abl to clear my plate beforeand this time i left about half someth was miss 

i was too tire and it was get too late to even ask for a manag our daughter had been good the entir meal time up until the check came i just knew that it was in my famili best interest to fill out their littl opinion card and be on our way

th girl who sat us was bring in their chalkboard sign when we were leaving
did she say goodby or thank or even a go to hell nope not a singl word

 this staff was so rude clueless and they should be trainok i have to apolog to juli t if your read this im sorri dont be mad at me i lie to you i said i like it  i was probabl one of the last in vega to tri their pizza but i had heard such negat review from peopl i had no desir but the opportun came up when my friend and her bf this is his fav place invit me so of cours i accept anywaysimmedi 1 star for patio seat and i love love love the white xmas type light hang from the lattic and for it be tuesday tast half of glass of wine i did enjoy my wine no star for food

th pizza look decent when it came out nice big bubbl piec of chees fresh basil on top look good well my friend had told me that the ricotta was sweet i wasnt quit prepar for the tast of it i wasnt down with sweet ricotta on my pizza the sauc had no flavor at least the pepperoni gave it some i ask the server for a side of ranch we dont serv ranch our pizza doesnt need it uh huh i beg to differ this is for corpor pizza lover who dont know ani better  onc again to each their own but i will never returntotal disappoint on so mani level with this place  i went there last night  excit to final tri the place sinc i drive past it on my way to and from work everyday  when it is all lit up at night it just seem so invit  i was meet a friend to talk busi and we arriv a bit befor 830 
mi experi start off bad and just went downhil from there  when we walk in all the booth were taken but none of the tabl in the dine room nor the 2 tabl along the back wall that each seat 6 but have the comfi booth seat on one side  we ask to be seat there but was told they need to keep them open in case a larg parti came in  serious   it was a wednesday night at 830 there would have been plenti of seat if a parti larger than our meager 2 top came in  strike 1
next our server lissa did come by quick to ask if we want to order we ask for a few minut  i also ask what the soup of the day was butternut squash mmmmm those few minut turn into more than a few and anoth server ask if we need anyth and end up take our order  i order the soup and tuna tartar  lissa then came back to the tabl to inform us that they were out of the soup of the day  strike 2  i order a side of veget instead
lissa refil my water glass browni point for that but spill some not onli on the tabl but my hand  she doesnt apolog clean it up noth just walk away  strike 3
mi companion get the edamam which were not bad but the bowl that they were serv in had a serious chip on the rim  it was bad enough to cut someon if you werent care  strike 4
mi tuna tartar was pretti terribl a few chunk of chewi fish that were somewhat grey in color hidden among some green that had way to mani caper which made it super salti  i ate a littl less than half of it becaus i was so hungri and didnt want to deal with send it back  strike 5
next up the sorri ass poor excus for a side of veget  when lissa set down in front of me this tini dish with wilt spinach and 1 piec of squash that was quarter and 1 piec of zucchini that was quarter i couldnt believ it  there was a layer of spinach water at the bottom and it tast like it was season with mrs dash  again i ate it becaus i was starv but realiz that each bite basic cost me a dollar it was 5 buck strike 6
not even done yet
at 930 lissa ask us if we want anyth els my companion inform her that her boyfriend will be join us in a few minut to get some dinner  we are inform that the kitchen is close  there were still peopl in the place and from what i gather from the websit the kitchen close when the parti is over  so now my companion is on yelp tri to find anoth place to go meet him so he can eat  strike 7
she find a place not far and is go to meet her man by 10 becaus we still had some busi to discuss  i said she could just go so he didnt have to wait but alway the profession she stay so we could wrap up our meeting
at 945 some peopl walk in are seat and given menus  i ask the server that help them a veri nice gentleman if they were go to be eat becaus we were told the kitchen was close  he went and check and apolog for the mixup but the kitchen was still open  strike 8 
 i wish that guy was our server becaus he was great i also see him speak to lissa who glanc at our tabl but she never come over herself to apolog  i think she was in a hurri to clock out  strike 9
when lissa bring us our bill the soup that they were out of was still on it  when i point this out to her she state sinc i got the side of veget which wasnt on the bill she just left the soup in place of it  first from a manag prospect you have to keep track of everyth that is serv to figur out your food and product cost  second it was just plain lazi to not correct the bill  strike 10
furthermor the soup was 7 and the veget 5 a cost differ that i point out to her  she said she would take care of it  she bring back the bill and say ok they took a dollar off  are you kid me  you cant subtract 5 from 7  strike 11
i am so done with this place at this point i leav a chintzi 5 tip i realli want to leav noth but the old school server in me wouldnt allow it  i left feel cheat out of 70 and will never go backi had a groupon for this place so i went there around 9 am to check it out i realli want to like the place sinc i live close by and absolut love chicken tenders

i went ahead and place my order just fine but onc i show her my groupon thing went downhil quick the guy in the back start say someth along the line of oh great our first groupon of the day in a sarcast tone like my friend and i were just wast their time he appear to be one of the owner so that made me feel pretti awesom the ladi then start write down the number of the groupon and hand me back my phone i was put it into my pocket when she becam veri direct and in my opinion rude accus me of not hit the redeem button i told her that i had hit redeem and she then gave me the death stare and ask me to place my phone down on the counter to say the least it was an extrem awkward situat i was tempt just to leav but for some reason i truli thought the food would make up for the service

th food was ok chicken tender were veri juici but to me they lack ani kind of real kick in flavor or crunch from the bread the gfri were pretti good though all the way around beignet were ok as well i guess if youv never had the real thing then you would probabl like them quit a bit 

to be honest the servic was horribl i still cant believ how the owner who probabl place the ad would say someth like that whether or not he thought i could hear him as for the ladi who actual took my order i have no idea if it was just an off day or if she truli believ it ok to talk to peopl and treat them like that mayb shes not a morn person but if that the case they either should keep her off the morn schedul or just open later

sav yourself money and time and avoid this place im be serious run far far awaytwicei repeat twice we order from this place and that it the first time we call and order pizza and a 2 liter of diet coke when it arriv they had the generic diet rite wtf what kind of cheap place substitut out the 2 liter of soda when they charg 3bottl 
the next visit we specif ask what brand of soda they had and they said pepsi so we order a 2 liter of pepsi  super simpl request that ive never had a problem with anywher els when the pizza come they bring us some pepsi x dragonfruit flavor pepsi what the hell all i want is pepsi regular freak normal simpl everyday pepsi
anyways
th pizza is mediocr at best not worthi of a review on it own the wing are probabl the onli part of the order that deserv ani recognit that recognit is a1star never again will i order from here it get my stamp

do             not              eat             at                 apolloif i could turn back time and not have gone to la petit franc bistroi would  it was terribl  from the slow servic to the ice tea that wasnt ice teaand the waiter not even notic no one at our tabl drank itto the sick feel i had after the meal
th smoke salmon crepe were not edibl  they were salti and sick fishi  we hid them under the blob of lettuc they call a salad  we also got their version of a pizzait was at least palatablebut not worth bring the left over home  also we had a quich lorrain  i felt like i was eat hospit food  again we could eat it but it wasnt veri good  we want dessertbut i was scare to tri anyth further  

we had just had two great crepe experi while travel in san fran and were look forward to this  im sorri to write this review as i think it is a individu owner tri to make a go of thingsbut i think this place need to revamp befor it becom a casual  i onli think it is fair to warn other so no one els wast time money and calori on this jointhere the thing  were pretti big fan of cork so when we learn about bld we were super excit to go  sad our first experi was realli bad  becaus we love cork so much we decid not to write a review until we had gone a 2nd time  could be a fluke right  wrong  

here the breakdown

visit 1

1 we receiv chicken that was still releas pink not clear liquid  when we ask them to give us new chicken the server liter ask oh you want that more well done as if there is anoth way to serv chicken
2 after get the chicken back we found that they didnt actual replat the dish they just put new chicken on it  so if the pink liquid did contain ani bacteria it was definit still there
3 both my husband and i had some pretti terribl digest issu that i wont go into detail on
4 the server seem genet engin to avoid their tabl  in the 2 hour we were there id say we saw our server three times

visit 2

1 the servic was a bit better today but
2 both my husband myself and a 3rd guest had bridesmaid style reaction to the food within a few hour of our visit  im talk total upper andor lower gi evacu 

both visit id say cost rough 30 per person and we end up sick and annoyed

i will never returnbld is the one place in chandler that i realli want to like but after three visit i just give up they have a greatlook menu a hipkinda vibe and all the promis in the world and that where it ends

a disinterest hostess will invari seat you in the one tabl youd least prefer near the kitchen entranc near an angri babi whatever

next one of sever equal disinterest server will arriv to take your drink order and by the time youv work up a good thirst drink will arriv if your lucki itll be the drink you actual order if your realli lucki theyll be good

th one save grace on the breakfast menu is the mont cristo a serious everyth els is averag despit how it read on the overpromis menu and dont worri about the price just pretend your in scottsdal or say midtown manhattan for the entir meal if you rememb your in chandler youll just get angry

lik the breakfast menu the lunch menu equal overpromis but that okay becaus youll wait just as long to receiv your food if it not over or undercook you might as well just dig in and not think about how much you overpaid for a subpar meal

bld look and act like they want to be a bfd big friggin deal but they need to start care about both their custom and their food first a good menu doesnt make a good restaur if you dont deliv the goodbefor i get to the reason for the 1 star review let me give you a littl bit of background  i yelp banh mi sandwich for phoenix last night becaus i was crave one and want to find out what yelper out there think are the best  i was a bit surpris to see reathrey on the list as they are not a vietnames restaur but have patron the restaur at least a half dozen time i decid to read through the review  

mi boyfriend and i origin went to the restaur after read the glow articl in phoenix magazin  our first visit there was pretti unev  we order the mi keaw soup spring roll and the crepe which by the way was serv slight burn with that side face down but i never complain about my food and order it again on later visit  my onli real complaint that first even was the incred uncomfort bench seat  on subsequ visit we opt for the tabl in the center of the space  i have tri a number of differ thing on the menu and while have no other cambodian food to compar it to i find it to be just meahhh  my boyfriend on the other hand love the mi keaw soup and has order it as take out a number of time and is the reason for our repeat busi  in my opinion the pho at mani valley vietnames restaur is much tastier

okay  back to the reason for the one star review  so here i was read through the review when i start come across the owner incred rude sarcast condescend disrespect and downright unaccept respons to his less than stellar review  i have three word for you get over yourself i dont care if you are run a michelan star rate restaur which clear you are not that type of disgust behavior will run your busi into the ground  i for one will be spread the word and not in a good way  

sincerely
a veri disappoint expatroni had to tri five guy tonit and wellim glad i did for mani reasons

y im an innout gal there noth better than a doubledoubl anim style no tomato and the fri well done heaven

pro five guy had one thing i like the cajun season for the fri main hot paprika and salt but it was a veri enjoy flavor it all went downhil from there sadly

con a greasi burger no matter how much the propaganga on the wall tell you otherwis the littl reviewswriteup from mag all along the wall the one im refer to it the articl nearest the bathroom the meat has veri littl flavor the juici they brag about was just oozi greas so be warn the top i chose grill onion saute mushroom lettuc pickl and mustard i order the bacon cheseburg for those of you curious the mushroom they use can button mushroom those godaw slimi discust thing with littl flavor but of what i like to think of as ass a biiiggg thumbsdown for use such a gross item it took away from ani potenti tasti of the burger and i end pick them all off after 2 bites

th fri wow total letdown but for the season they were soggi limpi greasi partial uncook and the worst french fri ive ever had in my life they also cook them in peanut oil so they have a uniqu tang to them that i did not care for in the least

innout has noth to worri about this place isnt even close to be a contend for a good burger jointyou knowit sure take a lot for me to give a 1star review that be said this is my first one in almost 50 review sugar factori american brasseri you let me down so hard after care consider this was probabl one of the top 5 worst dine experi ive ever had futur yelp list anyon 

im all about eat well and pay a high price for it especi in vega but after eat here i wish that my dine partner david and i just went to a normal cafe or even mcdonald on the way back to our resort  im typic lenient with this type of fare but our foul experi is just beyond my comprehension

gr we came in here veri late around 400 am howev the restaur was still busi and seem wellstaf the menu look appeal enough so we were sat immedi for a tabl for two we were just desper for some suppos decent food yelp here had it at 35 star cumulativelywhat the hell 

wait a while for waterokay wait a while to orderokay 
now never to see our waiter again well correct we saw our waiter but he never came within a 15 foot radius of our tabl cool thanks
th lone highlight of this disast we wait under 30 minut for food it never should have taken this long to begin with but whatev 

i had just a simpl burger how hard is that right i could bare stomach half of it im pretti confid that the bun was made back when the pari resort was actual builtcomplet ined i took the bun off eventu and even the rest just wasnt good i know that not descript but i was just turn off by it seem almost as old as the bun and ive had better chees and bacon top at a denni 

now the worst david had their basic chicken sandwich this made my burger look like a star the grill chicken was probabl roll around the strip like some hockey puck pick back up grill into oblivion then smash between the same nasti bun he had a quarter of it tri to just eat the meat and couldnt the waitstaff couldnt come by quick enough to scoop it up not onc ask our opinion

ohh it get better we couldnt get our check i mean realli realli couldnt get our check our waiter was still mia the other member of the waitstaff were snobbi and just kept say k to us like they were 6th grade girl never in my life have i consid get up and walk out but it kept run through my mind in the twenti minut we wait for our damn piec of paper state the damag 

well well still no check the manag come by and ask us how thing were david didnt say much but i did everi detail of our atroci meal escap my mouth like word vomit 5 bonus point if you catch that refer he seem a bit surpris and loos apolog and instead of comp our meal the right thing to do if he had ani hope of have repeat custom he said he would fetch our check um no  he came back and drop off our check with a 20 discount normal fine but this was just ridicul never ever again 


the sugar factori brasseri attempt to emul that of a highclass vega restaurantand miser fail i would never come here again even if i was paid there are so mani other better option in this fabul citii complet take back my origin 5 star review and apolog to anyon who wound up eat here recent due to it

a you can see from my previous review i realli love this place we come to vega probabl everi two month at least and have made it a point to eat here at least half the trip and alway recommend it to friend who ask for place to tri 

so fast forward to this weekend we havent been to vega sinc this summer due to a lot go on in our live so felt a littl out of the loop on some new stuff happen on the strip in between this time i guess one thing we miss was this place get new owner and chef i happen to brows yelp befor we head here for breakfast today and notic how terribl the recent review were but shrug it off becaus i had been here so mani time i thought i knew what to expect how wrong i was

i realli hope the new owner read and take all this recent negat feedback serious i cannot believ how much they are shun and insult their fan first after be seat we were told about the new water polici 2person for basic tap water in a bottl appar to save the environ and bla bla but it scream desper for as much money as they can take from custom and cheap 

that kinda piss off my boyfriend but we went whatev and tri to order boyfriend ask if he can order the 20 steak and egg but substitut the home fri for someth els and we are told sorri we have a new chef and no substitut are allow even if we pay extra no sorri that was the final straw

w told our waitress we had alreadi been serv coffe we would finish our coffe and go somewher els to eat she wasnt surpris and was pretti honest about how upset so mani custom have been due to the new polici and complet understood our feel so the 1 star is credit to her nice servicehonesti 

i have eaten at restaur that dont offer substitut but they are either extrem cheap or high end with qualiti ingredi and creativ menudish the chef dont want the ingredi compromis on the fact this place which is basic a cheesecak factori with more flare has the nerv to act pretenti like their denni qualiti over price steak and egg dish is too good to have a substitut side dish is ridicul and insult to the custom who want someth healthier with their entre 

so never again and definit wont be recommend this place anymor to anyon which is disappoint becaus we realli did like come here howev there are so mani food option in this area it unnecessari to frequent if not enjoy we paid 18 after tip for two coffe and our water ha and went to mon ami gabi and the experi there was so much betterclassi accommod and cheaper a few similar thing on the menu and about 5 less than sugar factori was ask and i guarante better qualiti food 

get over yourselv new owner and cater to who put  in your wallet your customlet me start by say that this is all base on our waiter sloan

mi friend and i came here for lunch one day at a time when the restaur was not in ani mean full mayb like four tabl were occupi let get the pros out of the way sinc there were onli a few

pro we both got the veggi burger which was fantast it is made with real veggi and on a bun that is purpl purpl and tast great for dessert we got the crepe nutella and smore and they too were veri delici but not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappi servic and lacklust surroundings

con who came up with the idea to cover everi inch in tabl and chair and in such a way that even janga would be shame serious not onli was there no room and i cring at the idea of how it realli would have been with a lot of peopl in there but our tabl was lopsid and kept rock back and forth the hostess who sat us even knew it she move it around a bit and said it would be fine no it was not

next up price yeah whatev it expens i get that 100 for lunch for two

now for the main one star review sloan our waiter yeah i rememb his name he was that bad 
the first sign was the fact that we wait 20 minut for our food to come out and when it did the person who was not our waiter but some random chick just drop them off and ran away liter ran away that ok not like i was go to ask for ketchup oh wait i was so i wait for our actual waiter to come over so i could ask for some sauc ten minut later out of the hole of hell he came up and i start with could i get some ranch and he turn to walk away my friend had to yell wait for him to return sinc she too want sauce
next up after eat and order dessert we wait anoth 20 minut all the while our dinner plate were in front of us and never clear not until the crepe came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off 
final the wait time for the check was ridicul not onli had we been there for an hour and half alreadi we had to wait even longer for sloan to notic us

and where was sloan this entir time i shit you not speak to the bartend the entir time serious you onli have like three tabl to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartend for the entir day 

mi friend had to wave him over to get a check and even then we were forc to wait until he pick it up from the tabl sinc he was right back with the bartender

not one person who work here seem to care about anyth but stand around and talk to one anoth there were plenti of other worker there but i never saw one not one do anyth well except for the onli other waitress there who was actual do her job but she was the onli one

i dont ever expect to come back at least not at the same time sinc that seem to be the shift where all the lazi are put onill start with the posit   oh wait there werent ani  i cant even do a good analysi of the food becaus the wrong pizza was brought out and to boot it was a pizza we didnt particular care for  had an ingredi on it that my dine partner had a slight allergi to
in short complet horribl servic rude attitud when tri to get our order straighten out and ownermanag was unwil to give a decent concili for our troubl  
will never return  be treat like we were is unaccept especi when we act civil and to the point   
here is a list of folli that occur dure our experi at mama gina  
1  order an appet  was convinc by our waitress to tri the garlic knot instead onli to find out when our food arriv 35 minut later that they didnt even have ani to bring out  sidenot  after about 20 minut we inquir on the whereabout of this item to our waitress 20 minut for some garlic bread is a littl much and she said she would go checkappar that didnt happen
2  wrong pizza deliv to the tabl  after inquir about the order sinc it was take quit awhil to arriv and we had a movi to catch  the wrong pizza was brought out  we had order a 16 inch bbq chicken pizza and a 20 inch suprem was deliv to our tabl  honest it wasnt till 15 second after it was drop off that we went uh wait a minut this isnt what we order  immedi went to find our waitress to let her know  she went to her manag and they said they could make us the right one but wed have to wait  pend our time issu with the movi this wasnt an option  sinc we couldnt wait for anoth pizza to come out the manag said we could either take a 20 discount on the pizza or just leav and not pay  at this point we were starv and the movi was start in 10 minut  didnt realli have a choic at this point  i agre to the 20 discount so we could at least have someth to eat befor we sat for anoth 2 hour without food  side note  couldnt eat much consid one of the item on the suprem includ an item that my date has a slight allergi to
3  wrong discount  onc the bill came we were charg for the pizza that came to our tabl  which was 9 more than what we origin order  make even the 20 discount they were offer a total more than what we were expect to pay in the first place  waitress end up pay for our beverag to help offset the cost  also when speak to the manag he said we should have let him know sooner that there was an issu  how were we to know  the onli thing we knew prior to the food come out was that it was take forev to get to the tabl   and that we did bring to their attent  

i truli dislik write review that are this scath but i just couldnt believ how we were treat by the manag  if you are in the servic industri and the mistak are with your establish then do not make the custom feel as if they are the one at fault  i just dont believ they tri to make this better for usboo to our drink with friend meet there were 9 of us we met on the beauti outsid patio of provinc we had no plan for food but i will prefac by say on a previous dine experi the food was stellar 

servic was horrend we did get waterplenti of it a server kept come to the tabl with tray of water glass offer to get us more water 30 minut later a member of our parti final went to the restaur to get drink menus which we then wait and wait again for a server to get our drink order 
normal i dont put up with this nonsens and just leav but 2 of our friend had their kid across the street at the ymca and we want to visit with them befor they had to collect their youngun we quick kill our drink when they final arriv becaus by that time our coupl friend had to go pick up their kid 

i guess this time was a misslast week a group of us went into the mellow mushroom restaur in temp to have a quick lunch befor a 1pm meet we got there at noon order and then wait and wait and wait at 1250pm i told my waitress that i had a 1pm meet and pleas run my card now so i can take my food and run to my meet well i get my food at 1pm and it is the wrong order argghhh so i have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my cowork bring it to me but i am still wait for my card which i gave to her 10 minut ago and i have to go this meet that i am alreadi late for my cowork sign my card and i get my cold food later and again it the wrong order i eat it anyway and cant lie it tast realli good

fast forward to today where a cowork and i had anoth 1pm meet we decid to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them anoth chanc i make our order at 1205pm and the girl say that it will take 20 minut so i go to pick them up at 1230pm and they arent readi so again i wait and wait and wait while i am wait i hear the kitchen manag and a server talk about a tabl where the custom was not so happi about have to wait so long for their food and was tri to get a discount at that moment i hear the kitchen manag refer to the custom that is argu this as a douchebag my jaw just drop at what i have just heard i have to go outsid becaus i dont wanna hear more so i continu to wait until i get our food at 1255pm 30 minut after it was promis to me we end up have to eat our food dure our meet uggh 

now the food is great here they do an great job at this but the custom servic is absolut dread and that is be nice surpris becaus there is usual 25 peopl work in there at one time i do not recommend mellow mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patienc and dont mind the kitchen staff call you douchebag and other name behind your back ill passserious   2399 for linguin and clam  

i realli want to have a closer goto for well done simpl italian sinc baci move to qc but this was just aw   the menu is not extens so youd expect that what is on there to be reason price and veri well done    my husband and i were turn off by the bizarr scent candl  restroom smell in the dine room so we ate on the patio with the bug   the restaur is veri recent so youd think theyd have the light outsid all in work order   theyr not    

the servic was outstand marci was clear a pro  but no level of servic can make up for gamey can clam bit on box linguin 

well drive to baci next timei am watch tv and i see this place on restaur stakeout i think that is so funni this guy cant figur out whi his busi is fail my hous is onli 2 block from here i am singl and i like to sit at the bar and eat so i dont have to sit at a tabl by myself i also like to play video poker i went here about 2 week after it open i was look forward to find a new place to go i walk in and the bar is pack i found a seat at the bar i was the onli woman in there all the men were look at me like i shouldnt be therethen i realiz the pretti young bartend was danc and lift up her shirt to show her stuff behind the bar all the guy were yell i am middl age and not too hot anymor i felt veri uncomfort and out of place i play 4000 in video poker befor i final got a drink i ask for a menu but never got one i left and never went back i thought it was a strip club30 for two peopl to eat in n out qualiti burger in a chipotl atmospher rip off save your moneyfirst of all i dont like to give bad review and i general consid myself a patient person but i came here after work a 13 hour shift and i was starv gave my name to the host for a tabl for two wait a good 15 min gentleman who come in after get seat befor me realli um ok final seat and drink order place my ice green tea tast like dirti water then we order a coupl thing i general dont do ayc sushi becaus i find the fish isnt good so i opt to do a la cart for my first visit i dont like roll with mayo or dairi or sauc like orgasm sauc i immedi notic the rice to fish ratio was way off fish was dri rice was dri great
 
now let me get to the servicew couldnt get our server to come around onc the cutest littl old ladi sit at the tabl next to us flag a server down for her check and then told them that we need our server as well again never saw her at this point it when i contempl walk out and leav money for what i thought we owe servic was atroci never refil my drink and couldnt order ani more food which was probabl a good thing i will never give this place a second tri or recommend overrthis was my favorit ayc place which i had been visit for the last two year until my last visit where i had the worst custom servic experi ever

mi boyfriend and i are well awar of the polici for uni and sweet shrimp one order per person which was what we order but the chef gave us a realli hard time about it and would onli serv us one order not onli that but they were hispan chef and immedi start bad mouth us in spanish unfortun i speak spanish as well howev im light skin enough to pass off as a white girl so i understood everyth so for ani of you who are wonder what the chef is say while theyr stare at you while your seat in front of them at the bar dont think theyr say sweet thing about you 

after we did not receiv the order the chef continu to ignor us while we sat there in front of them they continu talk and giggl while take glanc at us the server eventu came around to fill our drink as we had noth left and the server also hispan ask the chef what was wrong or whi we look annoy the chef later repli in spanish that it was becaus we want more food so i interrupt and in spanish spoke out to them of cours the chef at that point turn bright red sinc they were unawar that i spoke spanish and was listen to them the entir time needless to say i was furious 

im still baffl that someon can talk all this mess up stuff while you sit in front of them 

thank to this i will never returnthis review is most due to the absolut horribl attitud our tabl was given and the horribl servic by the server name emma

whi in the world they would have someon so miser work there is beyond me

th food wont even get a review we couldnt get past the fact we wet treat as a huge inconveni to our serverim never come here again

when i first came i was wait in line forev while the securitybounc let sever peopl ahead of me i didnt see them check anyth off a list so they couldnt be vip or anyth like that

then i final get in and the servic just isnt there i wait and wait and final the bartend take my order and give me a veri weak drink hello i didnt pay 7 for a glass of coca cola i ask for a jack and coke

dont believ the hype this place sucks

also el hefe claim to have amaz taco ive had better taco from a taco bus back home in seattl washingtondo not buy bottl servic here we call ahead and reserv a tabl  they told us the tabl was 1 bottl minimum   we usual get 1 bottl of grey goos and then just order drink and shot from our server spend just as much as a bottl  

server was pour extra drink without put mixer in them and leav them on the side of the tabl then i notic her take one of them away as if it was an empti 

our server was also pour veri heavi i dont usual mind and understand the server want the bottl to finish quicker so we buy more 

onc the bottl ran out the server told us we need to buy anoth one we said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shot mix drink etc etc  there was 8 of us and we would have easili ran up more money than a bottl in the same time frame of drink a bottl  

the server told us to get off the tabl sinc we are not buy anoth bottl  this has never happen at revolv smashbox firehous axi or american junki we said we would be run up an equal amount she said the onli way she would allow us to stay is if each of us rack up a 200 tab 


cliffs
serv was constant pour extra drink and leav them around our table
serv boot us from tabl for not buy anoth bottl even though we were will to run up higher  tabsad and confus lunch experi i mistaken went to sakura as i thought it was teriyaki mad which id bookmark as a place to escap for lunch teriyaki mad is somewher down the road and becaus id alreadi park and walk up to the door it wasnt worth anoth 15 minut for me to hop down to teriyaki mad what a tragic mistake

cal sakura a restaur is generous servic was terribleth girl who was play cashier was rude and was have convers with the other two guy behind the counter while i was order ramen isnt a complic order but at least give me the courtesi of your full attent when im order my food i got the tonkatsu ramen and my maruchan packet of noodl was serv with a question cloudi broth too much miso and three thin and deepli unsatisfi piec of pork yes i count them i kept hope that my wander chopstick would bump into anoth piec of pork but kept come up empti i am embarrass to say i finish most of the bowl becaus i was so hungri 

i am also embarrass to admit that i tip 1 becaus this is one of those fast food establish that presumptu add a tip line on their receipt the onli servic i got here was someon dump a pack of noodl into a plastic bowl stir up the ingredi and serv it to me when the noodl were soft this doe not constitut a tip of ani sort and base on the uncomfort 30 second at the regist watch the sushi chef roll sushi order sushi doe not warrant a tip either he made one of the sloppiest roll ive ever seen if someon serv me that roll id send it backand i dont send anyth back 

ye along with shame terribl ramen they dare to serv eatatyourownrisk sushi i imagin the rest of the menu is unauthent american japanes dish  id rather go lick the floor of the chipotl next door than eat here again but ill probabl just get a burrito insteadthis review is for the bar only
i had a date last week and was look for a local bar to grab drink at i call cycl on wednesday and was told they would be open until at least midnight on friday and the guy was veri nice friday arriv and i take my date there and when we enter the bar the bartend make a gas face and say they are close for the night i told her that i call just two day earlier and she just stare at me no attempt at fix anyth nada one drunken patron at the bar yell to open the bar back up but i was over it well done cyclnever again this place is gross  i got a dozen donut at the drive through and ask for no cake donut  when i got home and open the box all there was were cake so i hop in my car and took them back  i watch the ladi take them and put them back on the shelf to be resold  i could have spit all over them or poke everi singl one of them  of cours i didnt but to see them be restock for someon els is just straight up nasti and i know it a fast food nono  serious now ill never know who has been touch my food there so i wont be back  it too bad they have decent coffereserv a cabana for a friend bachelorett through vip servic high advertis on their websit  had been here a few time befor no issu had a lot of fun  onc i determin that spanish fli would work for us there were multipl email back and forth between the vip host and myself about detail for the event and i had confid that everyth would be made perfect for our group of 25 girl that night  i talk it up to mani in our group becaus other had made differ suggest as to other place for the even but i realli push for spanish fli becaus of the way the communic was go with the vip host and myself  i truli felt they would make my friend feel special  unfortun i could not have been more wrong  

when i arriv with the 20 girl in my group i discov that absolut none of the decor i hand deliv in 2 separ trip that day at the offeringsuggest of the host had been set up in our cabana which was not even a cabanajust a squar couch with a fold down umbrella cabana are reserv onli for those get bottl servic  i was taken to a back offic to speak with the host and a manag and was told that there were multipl bachelorett parti that even and there was some confus as to whos decor were for which parti  i had clear label my decor with a veri larg slip of paper with the bride name on it who the reserv for the even was under so im not quit sure where the confus came into play and the other bachelorett parti i saw there that even didnt appear to have ani decor  i also sent the host an email after i finish drop off the 2nd set of decor the day of the parti ask if i need to do anyth els to be sure that the decor was taken care of as i want to be certain everyth would be set up for us when we arriv  it was a terribl disappoint that it wasnt  not onli did i miss out on all of the fun at the hotel pool with the rest of the bridal parti so i could drop thing off at the club but the situat made me as the organ look like i was the one who let the ball drop  to make matter wors while the host ran around tri to set thing up at the last minut nobodi was told to come and take care of us while we wait  the manag should certain have been the one to be sure that was happen rather than continu to sit in the back offic  

the host final show us to our seat which wasnt the area where i had origin request at all but complet on the opposit side of the club and as far away from the danc floor as possibl  we were final brought some complimentari shot and what i thought were complimentari pitcher of drink to make up for our troubl  howev at the end of the even i was charg for the pitcher as well  everi other bar we had been to that even happili to provid our parti with complimentari shot even if it was just in pass  had i known the shot were all that the hostess was provid us with for this huge faux pas i would have ask her to give me my bag of decor and left

we went for brunch on a saturday morn two week ago we were sat at 1050am we wait on our server for a while befor we could order at 1105 i want to order an item that wasnt avail until 1130 but i was told that i could not i told our server whose name start with a j and contain some es that i want exact the short stack with berri that was featur in a pictur on the menu is that the short stack i ask she said well the short stack has 6 pancak i said yes and the pictur has 6 pancak so it the same right it come with berri server sure me ok i want it just like the pictur not too confid that she realli knew the menu my husband order a 3cours brunch meal with a wrap soup and salad 
meanwhil anoth tabl had sat down near us they order from our same server at 1120 15 minut after us and the server told them that they could order off of the post1130 menu wow i could have wait 10 minut if id known that was the differ in the end i end up wait over an hour for our entre anyway the soup came out fair quick we wait anoth 25 minut for the salad meanwhil the tabl next to us was receiv their food more quick than our brought out person by the chef herself the chef pass by our tabl and onli smile never stop or spoke to us 
our server came by again and  ask confirm our wrap order except she ask me about it complet forget that my husband order it not me even later she came by again and said let me check on your entre order even later than that she came by and said it should be 5 minut the chef said dure that time the chef brought out a complimentari sampl dish of appl dessert to the tabl next to us  then our waiter came back 5 minut later when our entre should have arriv and brought us the same dish of appl dessert becaus in her word sorri for the delay here is someth that the chef is work on 
it was onli at 1225 that we final receiv our entre complet inexcus the tabl next to us receiv their less than a minut after us yet they order more than 15 minut after we did again the chef brought out their entre they were the onli tabl that receiv visit from the chef even though their server was actual our server it seem complet fishi to me
aft wed finish our entre a differ ladi work the regist came over to our tabl and ask if our food was ok she must have seen that wed been there an hour and a half she did not offer us anyth or offer to discount our meal or anyth neither did our server or the chef instead when we receiv our bill i was charg an extra fee for ad berri on the short stack they were not even good and there were onli 2 rasberri the rest were strawberri in the pictur there were raspberri blackberri blueberri 
we were plan to come back there everi day that we were in lv becaus the dessert look so good and we were excit about the food the whole experi was so disgust that we refus to return i high suggest that you go elsewher for vegan food in lv we had a fantast experi at komol thai restaur delici and fast friend service
sham on you pura vidathe onli good thing about this restaur is that it in an industri area with no other busi nearbi so park is easi and plenti but as a restaurant

first the concept behind this place is greatthey support local producefarm and suppli i can get behind that   but as one of my close vegan friend told me the biggest problem with the grow number of vegan restaur is that they tend to be run by vegan but not by busi peopl so they do not know how to proper run a restaur and oftentim feel like by just exist they are somehow do you a favor

simpli put wait 2 hour for food is unnaccept especi when no one alert you to ani delay and food shortag they are experienc  and this restaur is veri small insid hold less than 20 peopl and there are outsid tabl for anoth 8  so at full capac it hold less than 30 peopl and when we were there they were not at full

th chef had a condescend attitud toward my friend who inquir polit where the food was and tri to somehow pass off that it normal to wait 2 hour for your food wtf

long stori short half of our parti got our food the other half did not while we were there  the restaur was finish up 2 of the order by the time we left so they pack it up and gave it to us for free but the iron thing is the one person who never got ani food order the simplest easiest quickest thing to make on the menu pancakes

speak of the menu when the waitress come and say she need to explain it you know your in troubl  no menu should requir explan that mean it too convolut and needless complic  person i didnt think it need ani explan tho it was quit larg and mayb they would  be better serv edit it down to half the item do them well and get it out to the tabl in a time manner

i felt bad for the waitress sinc she seem frustrat too but at the same time she is the liason between our tabl and the kitchen so where was she in be proactiv about get our food prepar also in 2 hour she never refil our water  sure we could have ask for refil but realli at that point we realli shouldnt have to ask

a for the food itself  noth great go on  weve had much better vegan food elsewher that employ finess and techniqu and manag to be full of flavour  our soup was veri bland and need a lot of salt to get it edibl  our cheesi potato could have been good but the potato were not cook all way thru so a bit hard  we must have liter gotten the last half of potato sinc our other friend who never got their meal was becaus of run out of potato  our quesadilla was ok but the basic point of a quesadilla is tortilla and melt gooey chees insid anyth els is an afterthought  almost no chees just a bunch of veggi stuf into a tortilla  the grill chees we got was realli good tho  the vegan chees melt and has the same texturetast as real chees  sourdough bread realli good  but a grill chees sandwich shouldnt take 2 hour to serve

even my vegan friend in town know of this restaur reput and said they could have told me not to bother with pura vida  im not their prime demograph not vegan or veg but it not do them ani servic when the vegan communiti know to stay awayveri poor custom service

w to tri with the famili after hear a lot of good thing about the food  we arriv exact an hour befor they close and after wait a few minutesalthough we were seen by employe upon entri at the front were ask if we had a reserv by someon run helpless back and forth behind the counter  we repli  that we did not and she state that they would not be abl to serv us then becaus they were  way back up and would be close in a few minut even though we were there an hour befor list close and there were at least five tabl open  we advis the ladi that we had a groupon that was expir that day and mayb we could use it for take out or at least the bakeri  she declin but did inform us that they would still allow us to use it for the origin valu we paid  i told her that this was groupon polici alreadi and not the restaur and she just shrug and said sorry

thi poor exampl of custom servic unfortun cannot chang my mind about this place no matter how good the food is suppos to be  if this is how this establish choos to oper they shouldnt be in the sit down restaur busi  becaus of this experi i will be sure to strong advis against anyon tri this placereview say that you wait a long time here for your food we didnt even get ani food

aft the waitress seat my wife and i at the one decent lit free tabl and we were readi to order mayra decid that a parti of three which had just enter deserv our tabl more than we did and told us that we were sit at the wrong tabl and demand we move   now if she had said pleas or excus me or sorri or do you mind we would have cooper   but there was no reason that the threesom which turn out to be there for takeaway and not for a tabl  should have had prioriti over us  when i told mayra that we would rather leav she point repli that this was a communiti restaur impli that our behavior was inappropri  so we got up to leav   at that point someon told mayra that the threesom was there for takeaway which should have been her cue to apolog to us offer us a free drink and invit us to be seat but nooooooo

so we lefti have been eat at pura vida sinc they initi open as a matter of fact i have been a custom of chef mayra sinc befor this restaur open my father hire her to bake me a vegan cake for my 21st birthday

in term of pura vida the food at this establish has been consist good yes the wait is long yes the menus are all over the place yes the place is run in a discombobul fashion yes sometim the staff is short with custom but the food has alway been tasti 

mi visit earlier today though will mark the last time that i patron them ever pleas read of my experi below

mi friend and i walk in around 11am and were brisk told to read the sign look around we were unsur of what sign to read when it was point out to us it state plain that no groupon would be accept this weekend follow the 4th of juli and that if we have a groupon we can come back tomorrow this immedi gave me a flashback to father day weekend 13 when i came in with a differ friend and upon attempt to redeem her groupon were told that they would not accept it due to the holiday weekend even though it expir that weekend and no where on the groupon did it say that it was void on holiday weekend 

continu on not have a groupon on this visit my friend and i didnt worri about the sign we were then ask rather short so do you still want to eat here i could bare get the yes out of my mouth befor we were then ask well do you have a reserv have not ever made a reserv save for mother day 13 i said no we were then met pretti much with a let me see if we have room for you thank after a brief time we were seat 

upon choos our meal our order were taken i decid on tha frenchi which is a french toast dish with syrup banana fresh berri when they are in season and a drizzl of chocol syrup have order this dish on mother day and not abl to eat more than two bite becaus it was absolut drench in chocol syrup and had no berri sinc they were not in season i polit ask three question this time 1 are berri in season yes 2 so there will be berri on my french toast yes 3 can i pleas order the dish with no chocol syrup yes

aft some great convers with my friend our meal arriv my french toast had no chocol syrup on it but neither did it have ani berri befor the waitress walk away i said oh it look like the berri are miss may i pleas have my berri to which she repli let me check

puzzl by this respons my friend and i exchang looks

chef mayra the owner then walk abras up to our tabl and lectur me on how my choos to get no chocol syrup mess up the flavor profil and essenti how dare i think that i could further ruin the flavor profil by enjoy berri on the dish with no chocol syrup  it realli made no sens at all so i then said well the menu say that the dish come with fresh berriesi just didnt want the chocol chef mayra then continu and state that i am lucki that she is here today els her chef would not have even alter her signatur dish to the extent of not put chocol syrup on it becaus they are train to not alter the signatur dish 

oh but this is a special day so she then hand me one larg strawberri slice up on a plate here is your berri this time but we wont be abl to do this next time

wow 

i felt like that was a huge slap in the face and the whole deal still doesnt make much sens to me whi was she in such a bad mood whi was she so offend that i didnt want chocol syrup to be sure i didnt mention the thirteen wast dollar on mother day due to the french toast be ruin by a gallon of chocolatey good mayb i should have 

in ani case i felt like a veri undervalu custom today in the time sinc pura vida open it door i have brought a lot of vari busi to them busi that would have initi never even consid this restaur less i suggest  it

it realli is too bad to see such a good restaur idea not live up to it potenti becaus of bad custom servic as a vegan i love to eat here but my money and my partner and my friend and my famili member money will be spent elsewher at restaur where we arent treat like annoythese folk dont understand that good servic make up at least 50 of the equat if you want to run a success restaur good food alon doesnt cut it hubbi and i went here on the reco of some friend food was tasti but servic and most import the staff attitud was unbeliev poor 

do yourself a favor and pass on pura vidawhat a wast of 20 serious this place caught my eye becaus it onli 2 mile from my hous and the area realli need a good burger place in my husband word if youv ever eaten a wendi burger youv alreadi been here for 599 for a burger yike and 299 for fri i was expect at least innout or smashbug qualiti dri small and justlack flavor 

wayyyyy too loud music you liter have to yell to give your order or talk while you sit and eat not go to start on their horribl light surfac of the sun anyone

 their burger are made to orderright  you tell them the top you want im simpl ketchup mustard lettuc and they still got it wrong with 13 yes thirteen peopl behind the counter they still manag to mess up my order when i see the tomato which i did not order and made a point to tell them i was allerg to they roll their eye take 10 min to remak it without an apolog 

20 for 2 burger and 1 fri and 1 small drink is not bad if it was amaz or in a nice restaur but for a fast food type of place they need innout price 

no militari discount either we were so excit to get a bar in buckey first time we went servic wasnt that great and food was not good at all our order was wrong and when we got our correct order it was cold we figur caus the place had just open so we said we would wait a coupl week and tri again the next visit was even wors servic was bad mean it took forev for someon to even take our drink order 30 min wait for food that was not worth the wait nope we will not be returnive been to halftim 5 time sinc it open last year the food is veri plain and distast grant that they have the typic barroom food but it just not good ive had better from the frozen food isl the servic is slow the peopl are rude and a littl haughti let face it this is buckey there is and never will be a reason to be haughti 

wont return and tell everyon we know that it an undesir place to be it worth the drive to go a littl farther to the longhorn for a truli delici burger and friend effici servicfirst buckey is hell second when i did walk in the server did say for me to sit anywher i wantedand all but one tabl was dirti 3rd i couldnt tell you anyth about the food becaus i was sit there for 10 minut without anybodi ask me for even a drink order or to give me a menu i walk outunbeliev i am kick myself right now for not read the most recent review of this place they all agre with me appal tast and upset execution

how is it possibl that everi singl dish we order tonight was an aw and tasteless disast they must of hire a new chef that the onli explan for this pan asian how do you go from have a near perfect review on yelp and start to slip this drastic everyth was beyond unaccept you have been check off on my list of the worst thai food i have ever had in my life

first offens the chicken pad thai was an unnatur pink the chicken look like dri overcook salmon  it was pink the noodl were beyond over cook to the point where they were hard all stuck togeth in block and then broke up into a million of littl piec when you would tri to pick them up there was no sauc at all not even soak into the pad thai noodl it was so dri so crazi dri there was no flavor at all  not even a hint of fish sauc sweet sour or anyth 

second offens the pad see ew with beef noodl were also stuck togeth like brick dri out and hard also whi did the onli flavor we tast was oil and extra black pepper did they run out of oyster sauc sweet soy sauc sugar fish sauc all of the tradit ingredi that go into this dish i could not handl eat oil flavor noodl with extrem black pepper into the trash it goe 

third offens the green curri with beef had the consist of tom yum soup i dont understand how they can make a curri so wateri i did not tast ani of the deep flavor you would typic find in curri no lemongrass no rich no sweet except for spici spici water would best explain this dish to add insult to injuri they offer us a minim amount of chewi beef piec and load up on undercook and hard veget cut cost much

what upset me the most was that the owner david wong was there and he allow these dish to be serv to us that was his stamp of neglig there is no qualiti or control here 

we ate 4 bite and could not get past how incred shoddi all of these dish were prepar im serious upset that we spent40 on all of this dri out bland food the joke is on us i would typic give restaur a second chanc but not this place never againthis is the quintessenti mexican restaur if you live in topeka kansa or south bend indiana and dont know what mexican food is  bland bland bland  let begin with the ridicul upcharg  195 for chip and flavorless salsa that remind me of tomato past  if you want some salsa with flavor you can get the tomatillo salsa     for an addit 195  dear restaurateur chip and salsa are free at real mexican food restaur  350 for three veri small corn tortilla  guacamol is a mexican food favorit so you better offer it and it had better be good  we paid 8 for guacamol that rival generic groceri store brand for flavor  luckili i could add the overpr tomatillo salsa to give it some zest  i dont know if the guacamol doesnt usual come with chip but they charg me for the aforement chipssalsa even though youd think the chip were part of the guacamol feast  the borracho bean were someth like 350 and amount to perhap five spoon of bean  on the bright okth not horribl side my fiance had a chees quesadilla that wasnt bad  this is the food equival of gilbert ortega jeweleri store  tourist will want to stop by to have some of the 100 tequila and to say they ate mexican food when they visit arizona  the rest of us who know about barrio cafe los dos molina etc will want to avoid itwth brio you broke my heart

i have visit brio in town squar numer time but the brio on rampart is so much closer to my home i came to enjoy their wonder happi hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the worst servic ive ever had in my life

1 it took the waitress 35 minut to take our order fine fine ill let that slide
2 the waitress didnt bring us ani bread we thought it was becaus it was happi hour but all the surround tabl had bread 
3 we were sit at a tini cocktail tabl with 3 cup of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the saltpepp sugar summari not much room when our food came he wouldnt take other dish away we ask him nice to if he could take some dish away and even pass it to him and he just walk away how freak rude i thought he was go to put someth down and come back becaus we clear had no room on our tini littl cocktail tabl to put 4 giant plate on the tabl and eat comfort but guess what he left like the jerk he is 
4 when we need the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found this was suppos to be a quick drink eat and go that end up take over 2 hour becaus the waitress forgot we exist 

the food was still consist and delici as expect but noth ruin an eat experi wors than bad custom service

th worst part of this visit was not onli was the waitress terribl and inattent the food server guy was also terribl it wasnt just one person that ruin my night it was two two terribl worker i couldnt believ the lack of custom servic we receiv at this place

il never come back to this brio againno no no  the number one rule for a restaur or ani other busi has got to be that you dont tri to cheat the custom  i went to the web site for this place befor go there for lunch today  wrote down what i plan to order includ these items

plinchik 2pc 249

somsa 2 pc 249


what he tri to charg me

plicnik 2 pc 399     o

somsa  you have to pay for 4 at 999     o

i also had an uzbek salad  a lamb kebab sandwich  it doesnt matter how the food was becaus tri to cheat the custom on the money is so not oki knew someth was wrong when i enter leon it didnt even smell like coffe the atmospher was not what i expect either it didnt have the energi of a coffe shopit felt like a cafe in a casino

 i order an ice latt but what they hand me had no coffe flavor at all i took it back to the counter where anoth custom was say that her chai latt didnt tast right the employe decid they must have switch them i dont think sother were certain no chai spice in my drink 

they attempt my drink again and hand me an ice coffe i gave up seek accuraci and accept it i have never tast such terribl coffe it was inferior to instant coffe and im not a fan of that either it had all the bitter of a veri dark roast coffe without ani coffe tast 

mi husband had an ice mocha which had an okay chocol flavor but againth coffe seem to be miss he also had a pastri which was definit past it sellbi datei place my order with this restaur through eat24com

on top of the food be 15 hrs late the philli chees steak end up be some type of chicken sandwich and none of the condiment side that we request were provided

th sad thing is i work in a depart of 70 peopl who love to order food to be deliv and who have never heard of this place if i had a good experi or even mediocr word would have spread like wildfir about this place and they could have had mani new customfuck gross 
so i came here in 2006 and i realli like it back then it had more varieti i was veri ardent to come back know that this place was great i ask  can i go walk around to see what is avail so i walk around and it look clean as you can see i took some pictures

i then decid to stay to my demis i regret i went to get some food sat down and the first this that happend was there was a cock roach on my fuck tabl i was so gross out 
at this point i then decid to leav i pick up and ask for a refund
sh was kind of hesit to give it to me but i then explain that if i stay i would around tell everybodi about my experi 
there arent enough word to describ how disgust this is
 i wouldnt even give it 1 starive been go here almost daili for year now sinc it first open and was sell their cake insid of whole foodswhich is how i discov my former favorit dessert spotthat be said each time i went hereno exagger but mayb about almost 1000 if not alreadi i would never order less than two dessertsy i had a huge sweet tooth that need to be cure 
needless to say ive alway had a pleasant experi which is whi i alway went back and refer all my friend and famili who would ask me to recommend a great spot in vega howev this past june 5 2013 i went there would be my last that i would ever support this place it a shame becaus i use to go there so often the owner husband who ran fashion show restaur would know i was such a huge fan of the place
i hate to call someon out but never in my life have i ever receiv terribl servic where i felt inform other was necessari and to write the name of the server been a server befor so i know what it like but this servic wasnt even consid thatsavannah at the fashion show mall present my best friendwho i introduc her here and i a half melt burnt off tiramisu cake where the frost was half off of the cake did not ask us for ani drink or silverwar roll her eye at me for no reasonim alway respect to server too and i order a carrot cake cooki to eat there which normal they alway bring out on a plate but savannah hand me the box and then tri to avoid me my best friend wit this terribl treatment from her and i had no idea whi she would give such terribl attitud she avoid us plenti of time and it realli ruin our experi for a lifetim never had a server not do the fundament or essenti part of waitress which is a greetingsavannah avoid me actual serv the food on a plateon look like shit pleas check out the tiramisu photo i post ask if we would like ani other food or drink from the menunoth was ask a smilesh roll her eye walk past us and alway had an attitud and just got such a nasti vibe from her that i refus to let anyon go here pleas also note that this cafe was not busi at all and it wasnt like we went dure open or near close either

i did see they final put a main entranc sign out front must have read my reviewum is this place a joke

i realli dont understand how this place has so mani good review  i came here becaus it seem popular and had a pretti good rate on yelp but i realli dont understand how mayb all the asu kid are impress by the modern interior design  mayb theyr sick of their meal plan food  or mayb peopl are just hungov and ani breakfast food tast good

anyways

th servic was aw  
not one singl person had a person or even a glimps of a smile  there was about 20 peopl work but do absolut noth  worker were just aimless wander around the dine room stand behind the counter in a daze or fist bump their friend talk about how wast they got the previous night no joke

th place was a mess
ther was food and garbag all over the ground  the drink station countertop was a sticki disgust mess spill lemon seed use napkin allll over it  the place was pretti busi but ani empti tabl was still cover in the previous custom dish and food mess  which i didnt understand sinc there were 3 worker wander around the dine room at all time  i had to flag down a daze employe and ask them to clear a tabl off for me  and of cours he just wipe even more food onto the alreadi disgust floor  serious food all over the floor  gross

th food took forev and was cold
w wait about 25 minut for a super simpl order of food  i got the farmer market  the whole entre was cold  and nobodi like cold soggi potato  it was suppos to have avocado on it but it had one mere sliver  my boyfriend food was also cold and he didnt eat it  we would have said someth to someon about a refund or get at least warmish food instead but everyon was too busi wander around in a zombi daze and at that point i just want to get the hell out of that disgust place

and there was aw music play like music that play realli loud in a club  like loud britney spear and hiphop  it was just weird  

i would never come back here and would advis anyon unless you like cold food disgust place and aw servic to tri anoth place for breakfastlunch instead

ewyesterday i went to pete for the lunch buffet at around 1245 pete is one of two thai restaur near my home and it happen to be on the rout home i was take so i chose to eat there i was greet by the singl server work who was later indic to be the owner  there were about five tabl occupi most with two or three patron but one larg tabl seat five or six peopl  he sat me at a tabl and i went to the buffet line to get some coconut chicken soup  i notic that the napkin bin was empti so i made the server awar of it   when i return to my tabl there was a glass of water wait at my tabl the soup was quit tasti  i finish my soup and went to make myself a plate came back and began to eat  the food was good but noth fantast  as i was eat the attend refil my water most with ice and that was the last servic i receiv from him until it was time to pay my bill
i wait a bit at my tabl but decid to go to the counter to have my tab drawn up and pay it the tab came to near 1100 with tax and i decid to pay with my debit card  i sign the voucher not notic the tip and total line at that time as i was in a hurri and inattent to it  the server hand it back to me and ask me to pleas fill in the tip and total line in a rather insist tone  sinc i realli  had receiv virtual no servic i hadnt even been ask whether i want anyth to drink other than water and his petul manner i decid not to includ a tip  he point this out to me and said that the peopl here depend on tip to make their live  i repli that i understood that but my servic had been poor  he then told me to leav and dont come back  wow  i told him that i had been there a few time befor and i alway tip but today i didnt feel a tip was warrant i explain whi as describ abov he said that he knew id been there befor and that i never tip becaus other had told him so and that he went over all the creditdebit voucher person and rememb me i was astonish so now he was call my a liar  at best this was man truli over his head and not control of either his faculti nor his busi  at it worst this was an invas of my honor not to mention my privacy
so for the record i will not be return to pete anymor and i wholeheart recommend that you do not patron this establish either  there is no excus for this sort of behavior at a servic establishcorpor should close this location

 loud music
 employe act like their in a schoolyard
 this locat doesnt offer all sandwich ingredi such as bean sprouts
 want extra vinaigrett on the side  they dont have the small plastic cups
 
stay away  or els  enjoy the bad experience

 i sent an email to corporate
corpor could care less  they never respondwhat can realli be said about starbuck that hasnt alreadi what seem to be 10 year ago awesom coffe has turn into today meh ive had better

thi is the locat insid the safeway i usual stick to a tea but if your look for coffe close to this area tri lux on central about 5 mile awayi show up here two night ago just befor closingnow i did not know they close at 6pm i just happen to drive here after work get off at 530 and show up around 555  there was a girl in a pink shirt and a long brown poni tail sweep the floor right in the front and as soon as i step foot out of my car she ran over to the openclos sign and flip it to close  

look i know it rude to show up late to a restaur becaus that mean the server are wait a good hour for me to leav but this is a coffe shop and i would have been in and out and i wouldnt have even mind if they told me that they can onli offer it to go which is what i want 

you are a local busi compet with the big boy and im sure you could benefit from the 20 or so buck plus tip i was about to drop for 4 drink and mayb a snack i would never complain if i show up after close but you close a coupl minut earli just to avoid have more custom and that is outrag and plain laziso we went again it was worst that the first time

sinc they dont use tray they drop my husband breakfast on the floor anoth employe not our server walk up and ask my husband if he got a bite of it wt as if he took a bite and threw it on the floor or someth my husband said no and the employe said that fked up dude and walk off i am not a prude but i do believ in profession languag is a workplac 

so two employe come to clean up the mess one has dirti dish in his hand i saw it come i was hope he wouldnt but he did he put his dirti dish on my tabl next to my plate of food gross 

vega has plenti of restaur it servic that make it great or not this place is a no go for mewow

4 of us went here for breakfast all stay out caesar so it made sens  we walk up rather earli befor 9 am and even though they had at least 10 open 4 top tabl were told it would be a 15 min wait strike 1   we were in town for a convent and realli didnt have the 15 min so we sat up at the bar bar servic was veri slow guess whi bc everyon was sit up there so there was not enough staff to handl the full bar we wait on numer occas for everyth from greet to drink order to silverwar to ketchup to more ketchup to more drink deliveri to check deliveri strike 2this is a manag problem in my opinion staf was a problem throughout the restaur 

order our food present was horrend see my pictur on how terribl my plate look  it also horrend that grit are as expens as they are on this menui think they were like 11 it also a travesti that you cant subout home  fri for anyth els grit fruit tomato etc strike 3  it also a shame that their cheapest breakfast is like 17 for just egg toast and homefri my other friend actual return her meal bc it was ice cold  

manag has to work on the number of employe work avail of ketchup salt and pepper and silverwar on the tabl and present and timeli of deliveri as well as seat and the hostess stand that a cri shame in las vegayes i too want a cronut  there was a larg sign in front announc that they where there

no cronut for you nextthis place can be sum up in one wordridicul  my fianc and i have been to this locat sever time  at first the servic was reason  howev dure the past few visit the servic has been horribl  
first we call in a pick up order which was suppos to be readi in 20 minut  i arriv at the locat in 30 minut and the staff hadnt even start the order and was absolut clueless on what to do  yet i tri to be patient pick up my food and went home

second we call in anoth pick up order  again it would be readi in 20 minut  i arriv at the 20 minut mark and to my surpris they hadnt even start the order  well this was enough i simpli advis the staff to forget the order and left the properti to hit up joe bbq in gilbert who told me my order would be readi in 10 minutesand it was

i typic dont write review on restaur howev i felt i need to advis dickey of their servic issu  i did and the manag promis chang and for me to tri it again  so about one week later i made the same order and they were on time for onc  the manag promis chang and thank us for give dickey anoth chance

about a month later we sent in anoth pick up order and noth had chang  it was the same ordeal again  i absolut refus to visit this dickey locat and spend my money at this establish  

mi fianc still had faith in this locat howev the same exact servic was provid to her  obvious there are some manag and staff issu at this locat as they have no idea how to proper deal with togo order  

take it from me you are better off drive over to joe bbq or visit the dickey locat in scottsdal  the scottsdal locat has never onc given my fianc and i this type of service


a a disclaim i want for you to keep in mind that dure all of these visit it wasnt busi  there wasnt a line go out the door  it simpli came down to a lazi staff and lack of manag that caus these issu  

i am firm in my decis that i will never get food from this locationeven if it were freeveri poor custom servic there staff has an attitud i wont ever step foot in their store again becaus of the amount of disrespect they gave methis is my saddest one star rate review ever onli becaus the food could have actual been veri good sinc everyth was nice flavor but what i receiv i find unforgivable

w start with a chees plate and the first thing i notic was the chees all appear to be cut far in advanc from our order the tallegio chees was also unlik ani tallegio chees ive ever tri with a much milder tast and firm textur disappoint but the real problem was this chees was not cut fresh to order

i went with the seafood special and it was so dri it was as if it was a left over that was over cook again and it was a filet of fish that was cut in half result in an approxim three oz portion for 29 i do note the sauc my fish was in was veri good and the veget of carrot and matchstick asparagus were good but my potato were shrivel up and over cook and when you cut them brown ring were threw them like old reheat over cook potato three oz of dri over cook possibl multipl time fish with old shrivel brown potato ive reheat fish at home and it is never as good as fresh made but never was it close to this dri and i note the potato are not accept either

mi husband pork shank was wors and was an unhealthi ice cold in the middl the heirloom bean ragout seem like can garbanzo bean with some lentil and didnt seem like a heirloom bean ragout i do note the sauc the bean were in was well made

our waiter did check on us and i told him about the dri fish and my husband told him about the ice cold center of the shank our waiter did offer to reheat the pork shank but my husband he declin as he felt it would have taken so long it would have ruin the meal even more so

when we receiv the bill 12 was remov from the cost of my husband pork shank i was surpris noon from manag said a word to us our waiter also forgot to give us a bread basket but that wasnt a big deal but have to add that becaus i am upset over the food they felt is ok to serve

i dont know if they are like this all the time or not but for sure id never go backhorribl   pretenti overpr poor qualiti food terribl servic  complet wast of money  

when i went with three friend the other night  we were greet by no fewer than six peopl at the front  the manag are walk around this mastro copi with earpiec like they are at some fanci club in nyc or vega  they are useless  we wait almost an hour to place our order  the food and servic would have been better at ani chipotl grill  

also the music  hello  80s rock with lyric in a fine dine room  

do not go  atrocithis review is for new year eve only
 my girlfriend and i had an 830 reserv and when we arriv there was a line out in front of the door they were not readi for the 2nd seat and took almost 20 minut to final start get everyon in and to their tabl 
2 i order a veri expens bottl of champagn and you would have thought the waiter would have taken care of us but he pretti much ignor us after he pour our champagn he place the champagn on the piano where anyon could have just pour themselv champagn from our bottl i had to ask him to get an ice bucket and move it next to our table
3 the waiter took our order for appet  which was about 6 differ option and he would bring them to us with sauc he brought back our order but had lobster claw and onli a coupl of stone crab claw i ask for what we order and he went back to get more he came back with onli 4 and said this was all they had they were out out after onli 30 minut into service
4 we order a caesar salad for 2 and when they brought it we tri it and you could tell it was pre prepar as the lettuc was soggi and the salad was over dressed
5 dinner came and at least our steak came out great
6 the waiter brought us dessert no choic on this huh and they were from a crappi pre prepar bakeri complet with the paper on the bottom of both dessert both un edibl 
7 this was by reserv onli so for you to be so total unprepar on servic food etc is inexcus for the price you charg you should be ashamed
8 i have travel around the world to some of the finest restaur in major european citi and they know how to take care of their custom where you want to come back dominick is arrog and think they are the be all end all guess what your not all that restaur are driven by custom and how you treat your custom will determin how well you will do unless you fix your problem not onli will you fail for next new year but i cant see you be in busi for long in this economi restaur are not a necess and peopl will go where they are taken care of as well as for the food your not cut it with your custom servic and for your sake you need to take a good long look at how your mistreat custom and chang it if not youll be anoth asterisk of and this was where dominick use to beavoid if at all possibl not worth your time  or calor intaki final reach my last straw with this place a few weekend ago there was a crowd there that the staff was obvious not happi about sit at the bar which is complet normal at ani bar it was midnight that mean deal with drunk peopl as a busi you are not alway go to like your custom or want them to stay there all night but punish the custom there that were not apart of that group is downright wrong instead of kick out the troubl maker they decid to shut the entir bar down earli sorri that just not how you oper a busi good luck to them tri to run a bar like thati have read so mani great review about this place and heard so mani peopl prais it  i tri it twice  
i want to start by say that the atmospher and locat are prime  this restaur is in a cool area and has a good vibe

but as an object eater i must say that le thai suck  

the first time my girlfriend and i order take out  i order the tom kha and my girlfriend order the tricurri  your go to slice up crappi ass button mushroom and put it in my soup  serious  is there even a thai restaur in town that tri to pull that crap  my soup look like a warm bowl of milk with some slice packag mushroom from albertson  and then am i suppos to think that it spicey  i order a spice level of 4 out of 5  next time i will order a 57  i prefer when thai restaur are on the spici side  i dont want the waiter or chef to decid what they think i can handl and then end up give me the equival of ketchup  the tricurri was also about as good as a can of spaghettio  

sinc first impress are not alway the best we tri it again tonight and decid to dine in  we saw the server a total of onc when he took our order  luckili we saw the bus boy 3 time so that he could ask us to clear the tabl for him to get a box and to get us the check  oh and to take my credit card  horribl servic with no explan or apologies
th order was wrong too i ask for a curri with no onion and got a bowl full of them  mayb that is whi the server liter never came back to see how our dinner was  

i cannot fathom whi anybodi who live in las vega would rate this thai restaur even mediocr with the amount of great or even good thai restaur all around us  it cool that we got a new ethnic restaur downtown and all but shouldnt we want them to be good too  a crappi restaur is bad busi for redevelop  i hope they improv soon



sinc this review the owner contact me direct to offer his genuin apolog and even offer to cook me a meal person  although i polit declin i thought this was a veri nice gestur that indic that they are realli tri to improv and make everybodi happi  you cant make everybodi happi but base on his reaction alon i would not discourag other peopl from give it a tri to see for themselvoh le thai i had such high hope for you i was hope my experi would warrant at least a second trip ala twas not meant to be the problem with my visit began the week befor i even arriv 

you see i walk by as i often do as a downtown employe i thought to myself oh what i wouldnt give for some delici thai yum when my group and i ask for a reserv you told us it would be an hour and a half wait you took my number you never call i thought you may have heard about the 3 day rule and confus my spot on the wait list with a date anyway i decid to give you a second chance

th follow week i got smart i thought  big group  get a reserv so i did group of 6 at noon you confirm the day befor and again an hour befor at noon we arriv you made us wait outsid in the 90 degre heat for 45 minut then you onli could seat 4 of the 6 of us you ask us to wait at the tabl stand until the guest next to us who had just gotten their food left wait what you want me to stare at other guest to intimid them into leav becaus you are terribl at restaur manag you want them to give us dirti look when you rush them out of their lunch then when i mention to you that we had a noon reserv you tell me we are busi well shoot i didnt know place that were busi didnt have to honor reserv wait a second you know who els is busi and in fact way busier than you  lotus of siam they honor reserv and their food is incred oh and make us eat our food in the heat outsid without mister was super bad form btw 

after this hellish experi i at least had hope for the food which was sad mehhh at best i had a rumbl in my tumbl all afternoon from your food 

so le thai i gave you a go but im break up with you it not me it you mediocr food isnt worth a headach i hope my gotolotus will take me back but even if it doesnt im still better off without youyikes

mi best friend said that she want to eat thai food downtown befor we start our night so onto my phone i went and le thai in east fremont seem to get a nod of approv it end up be a 45 minut wait and good thing they had that nifti app to text you when your tabl is readi becaus we went explor if you know in advanc that you will be eat here i suggest make a reserv 

we got seat at the bar and servic was except slow for be seat right in front it took anoth 15 min to get drink and 45 min for our food to come out 

crab rangoon was there even ani crab in this it tast like i was just eat cream chees wrap insid of a fri won ton 

pad see ewe my favorit thing to order at thai restaur and they butcher it it came out dark burnt and i couldnt even bother eat it after a few bite 

pad thai just no noodl were overcook and end up be flavorless overal 

the good my friend love her lucki buddha beer for 5burger overcook fri undercook if you are onli do burger and fri it need to be a lot better  veri annoy that you cannot get a glass of water  i like the theme the staff is friend and cute in their uniform  one time trip for me i will not go back or recommend  there are too mani good burger joint to choos fromdont go here the food is horribl  stay away there are better place i was disapoint in this place they talk a good game food suck burger were veri veri dri and no flavor they didnt tast fresh almost like they were microwav and the bread was hard as a rock the frys must have been cook in motor oil caus they were veri dark and nasti look they didnt look anyth like the pictur at all now i understand they want you to order a drink and not order a water i orderd a coke and a water and the waitress say they dont serv water just stupid caus i orderd a coke also again stay away from this placefirst and foremost this is my first review and i cant believ how absolut appal i am  but here it goesso my wife and i are in town for a famili emerg and decid to have lunch becaus we had a lil time on our hand we drove past hag on lv blvd and it caught my eye becaus of the name and i love a great burger upon enter i was excit and look forward to it the place seem almost like a hooter but for burger the smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicki for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear item that other have wore befor but i figur hey wth the waitress we had was veri person and  nice but was new the price were veri high for such a simpl menu my wife order the smallest burger and fri and i was talk into the quad bypass burger with like 20 strip of bacon i ask our waitress if the restaur offer militari discount as i often do when i am on a budget and travel she said let me ask upon return she said no sorri i was thank her for ask either way i though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so i was look forward to the food regardless at this point i was veri excit and amus on the place and was talk to my wife about how this place shouldwould be a goldmin they offer malt liquor strang in a restaurantin a can i order a tecat she a sugar coke
now for the twist of event our food arriv in less than 10 minut which is great but i was skeptic the burger was massiv and look so good but it was warm to the touch at best i had approx 3 bite and notic the bacon look as if had been microwav from be cook day ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistencygross the chees was not melt the fri look like they were cook in old oil due to the almost black color in natur i tri my hardest to stomach this but i couldnt i proceed to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cook to order at first she repli yes and then said someth that made me rais an eyebrow she began on inform me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old becaus of the way the owner is i ask her to elabor and she said he is so cheap that he make his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut cost she also inform me she almost walk out her second day on the job becaus of what he act like in his day to day oper she look excit when i ask to speak to him about the qualiti and prepar of my food when the ownermanag jon came to the tabl he sat down opposit from me and was veri hostil at this point i was pretti much amaz i would assum he would address my concern in a profession and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimid and apprehens i said i would pleas like anoth burger due to the dissatisfact of it not be fresh he look at myself and my wife and say  in six year i have never comp a meal and it wont be today i proceed to inform him i simpli want anoth burger and i am not look for a comp he then inform us that he would call the polic if we didnt pay i said i would not pay for a burger like this especi one that i didnt touch from his demeanor at this point i want to leav so i said look i will pay for my wife and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this qualiti of food
at this point i felt threaten and was basic be held against my own will i said fine pleas call the polic he proceed to lean over and say you know what  you start it when you ask for a discount i was like what he then say i cant stand the f ing militari i was so appal that he was address me like this in general and then he begin to say im from oxnard ca and we use to beat the s out of filthi mexican like you at this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief he leav and the tabl next to me were also express there disgust in the food and as he saw us speak with them he said to leav right now we were trespass as i leav i attempt to tip my waitress and he rip the money from my hand my wife and i wait outsid for the polic the whole time we are wait quiet the owner is harrass us go on a tirad about my race and my occup be total distast in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up lvpd i provid them id and they are in absolut disbelief they resolv the issu after question and bottom line it doe not matter the polic offic said i had to pay i total understand and uphold the law but request that i receiv what i pay for at least i gave it away to a homeless man
bottom line up front 1 do not go there for qualiti or fresh  it look good but is not 2 the owner is a disgust human be 3you are warn pleas dont be rob or degrad like me  go anywher elsi was somewhat excit to tri this place then i saw the menu as i was walk in it look revolt i dont want to know that the fri are done in 100 lard and that the milkshak are made with pure butter fat the beer select was less than mediocr the ambianc wasnt great 

then i told them i didnt want to wear the nasti smockth they want to put on you and they told me i had to so i walk out im guess i save myself sever day worth of calori for not much tast i end up at chicago brew compani at 4 queen which while it not as good as the origin in summerlin still kick the shit out of the heart attack place

and realli you eat for free if your over 350 pound that should be illeghorribl servic i told the hostess i was uncomfort wear the hospit gown provid becaus of a recent hospit stay she told us that i had to put it on or i could go away serious that all it took for me to turn around and walk out i will never go back hererealli realli not good

i was realli look forward to this place sinc there had been so much hype about it and it was not good even a littl bit

il tell you too i eat burger i eat a lot of burger probabl 4 or 5 time a week i have a hunk of cow in my mouth

so my boss and i decid to take off from the base and head down to heart attack for lunch on a monday when you first arriv they throw a hospit gown on you and have you take your seat this is where the first problem show up the waitress

thi woman was duuuuuuuuumb i realli hope for the sake of human that they make them act like that for tip or someth she was airheadimus maximus and would not stop talk she might be hand down the most annoy waitress ive ever encount 

i wont mention the out of nowher 70s music they were play is it 70s theme isnt it 50s diner theme or is it hospit theme what i realli want to focus on is the food

i heard they dont serv water which isnt true they serv bottl water so i got that 

the fri surpris were the highlight i know some review mention that the fri were noth special and didnt compliment the burger veri well but i found the fri to be the most enjoy part

and then the burger

i got a singl bypass about half a pound of meat with chees grill onion lettuc and tomato and decid not to opt for the 5 bacon slice 

i dont know where to start with this burger drycrack bun tootough burger meat soggi and kind of gross onion and the chees look like they laid it on after they cook it everyth about the burger look and tast wrong and not wrong in a calori way but wrong in a that not a hamburg way

i think one of the lower end place i go for a burger is whiskey dick on craig rd near the base and i went there today and was blown away by how much better the burger was 

mi boss agre that heart attack grill is never go to get our time and money again

if your over 350 pound go ahead for the free burger note that fri and drink are not includ for you but if your a look for a better burger than heart attack jack in the box and carl jr are right down the streetall the market and hype cant disguis the fact that their food just isnt veri good in fact it realli bad it a novelti restaur that just cant deliv on what most import for a restaur good food

first the good the entir premis of heart attack grill is to be as polit incorrect as possibl there a blood pressur machin with a high score list peopl over 350 lbs eat free they dont serv salad in fact you cant even get lettuc on your burger there are tvs all over the restaur that just show the press coverag of heart attack grill this get old real quick  id rather have the footbal game on the waitress are wear sexi nurs outfit but after the initi chuckl you actual have to eat

th bad the food the onli palat part of our meal was the mexican coke usual greasegood except at heart attack grill im not sure how they did it but they made a burger that both greasi and dri it like they overcook some beef and bacon slap it on a bun and then use a mister to spray flavorless oil all over the burger i tri to make it work i realli tri i ask if they had ani hot sauc but they said no you just have your choic of ketchup mustard and mayo the fri tast like they were just left in the fryer at low temperatur they came out greasi limp and without ani flavor at all

if you want a burger go to ani of the establish burger joint in town fatburg five guy in n out  even mcdonald make a better burger than heart attack grilldo not be fool by the food network propaganda of this place it has the potenti to be a realli cool place but unfortun it is a tacki venu with a dead atmospher and aw food

i visit this place becaus i had read about it onlin where it was advertis as an upbeat novelti restaur where you can custom your hamburg to be as unhealthi as possibl cool so far right wrong here is a short list of grievances

 no credit card accept serious we are in vega and live in the age of squar and intuit card reader that cost noth to set up judg by the atm at the door that charg 5 to withdraw money i say the owner is tri to make up lost revenu from a poor run restaur 

this is suppos to be a novelti restaur fun upbeat and borderlin riské with naughti nurs run around well you get none of that  the waitress look like they are miser and just go through the motion they are suppos to admit you into their clinic with some fanfar but instead all they do is put some shadi patient gown on you that smell like cigarett noth like what is advertised

food noth to write home about sure you get a lot of blah on your burger but none of it tast ani good in fact some fast food burger tast better for a burger pack with fatti chees and bacon it is sure miss the tast and flavor need to make it memorable

overal a disappoint experi the owner of is place probabl invest million in all the decor and paraphernalia in the restaur he should tri to invest some money in train and get a better staffi paid 20 for a singl patti cheeseburg fri milkshake
two coke  to top it off the burger had no flava  of cours i didnt eat all my food i was extrem hungri when i left  i just paid the bill hospit food tast better pass save your moneywhat a disappoint  when i first heard of this place i want to drive to arizona and experi it  i final got to tri it now that it is locat in vega and i was so disappoint the theme is awesom too bad the food is not  

to the owner pleas make the food tast good  you have a brilliant idea for a restaur in the perfect citi5 major health code violat 
it a shame becaus i realli like this place and the food was pretti good but i wont be eat there again 
httpwwwkphocomstory19242726dirtydiningaug9cockroachfallsonhealthinspectoratchinacso after i went on and on about how nice town squar was we stroll into this place for lunch wow that not a good wow it just a wow

if you like mexican food pleas dont go here it a wast of your valuabl time even if you have absolut noth to do the food was aw and they charg me for chip and salsa they charg me for chip and salsa realli that ridicul chip and salsa is the one appet that is alway free at ani mexican grill we order drink and one of our margarita came in a broken glass i guess this place turn into a nightclub at some point becaus there was a danc floor and a dj booth insid of a volkswagen van they should just do away with the food and focus on the parti becaus i was so not impressthis restaur is locat in town squar upstair across from the movi theater and across from ranch hous restaurant

w in for lunch not veri busi with onli 5 tabl occupied
th hostess went to seat us at the lousiest  spot in the room with most of the room empti as it a pretti big place so we ask to be seat at a booth wow this seem to realli piss her off and she brought us to a booth pin against the rail next to a pillar so sit down i see hole in the booth seat like cigarett burn hole realli you cant even smoke in there and the restaur is like a month or 2 new
th decor is kinda like beach and swap meet furnish come togeth in a bad way the booth tabl top was way too high where your plate would be like chest high veri awkward ill post a coupl of pic that give the flava  
the menu look and sound good but i couldnt smell anyth and the vibe was bad so we left befor eating

norm i give a second shot but too mani thing wrong in a short time not worth my time nor do they deserv my money i wont returnthis is the rickett famili chi cub owner newest ventur  perhap roll out to help pay the salari of their new prez theo epstein i initi thought this restaur had a cool concept  build your own hot dog they offer bison of which the famili has their own ranch  they also peddl at wrigley 

unfortun the restaur is not well thought out  is poor execut 

there are a number of specialti dog and sandwich as well  i went with the italian stallion  an italian sausag assembl  after my man drown the sandwich w marinathi sandwich never had a chanc  the bun essenti disintegr  for my 8 i end up with an ined mess that one could never pass off as a sandwich

i pass on their fri  tater tot look thing as they look stone cold and unappetizing

anoth one of their specialti dog is a chicago dog 6  simpl enough  right  although their come w kecthup  a chicago famili serv a chicago dog w ketchup  chicago dog are never ever serv w ketchup never ever

sorri rickett famili but you struck out on this one  hope theo has better successit been awhil yelp i havent written a review for age but i was so compel to write a review follow my recent visit to the newli open wahoo in town 

now ive been to the origin wahoo franchis in san diego for the first time last year and had an excel experi the food was excel and the servic was top notch befor i dive into the servic aspect about this particular vega locat ill touch on the food a bit simpli put nowher near the same the qualiti of the food is averag at best and the price are a bit higher the first time i went i was excit a bit disappoint but i was will to go there again if i happen to be in the area and so this particular night i was

first and foremost id like to consid myself a pretti patient and toler person if a server take awhil to refil drink andor doesnt seem to be tri to cater to my veri modest need i almost alway shrug it off but this particular night i was left beyond speechless 

me and a group of 5 or 6 walk into wahoo look to simpli grab a bite to eat after a long night of drink the place was relat empti there was mayb one or two other peopl there right upon enter a friend of mine immedi greet the bartend with how are ya tonight sir the bartend respond with dont call me sir without a smile we shrug it off sat down an order prompt sinc most of us were onli look to eat we ask if we could put in our food order he liter reject our request and stern state that he would onli take drink order and aggress and rude tri to convinc each and everi one of us to drink 

after final accept our food order it took 10 minut to get water anoth 5 to receiv drink most of our friend never even got their when we ask about them he spoke to us in a dumbfound i can do no wrong manner 

the wait for our food to arriv was averag and i was understand becaus it was past 3am and they probabl onli had one cook but i reason that it was slow and most of us had simpli order taco plate but then the food start trickl out of the kitchen one by one each dish come out 5 minut apart not onli did he forget who had what but everi singl order was pain incorrect everi singl order we had simpl unmodifi order watch your friend eat one by one is extrem unaccept ive been in the foodservic industri it an industri standard to send food out togeth one of my friend the last to have not receiv his food inquir about the status of his order the bartend ask what he had order smile and said it was come soon we then watch him walk over and punch in my friend order 45 minut after he had initi order it 

after that we all had enough and a few of my friend walk out the door i have never in my life have walk out on a tab but when we start complain he at least agre to comp our bill even though i told him i had no problem pay  becaus i knew i was never come back but while we were tri to figur out whi everyth went so wrong he simpli shrugged

i usual love to write review becaus i love spread the word about great busi and good eat but this was the first time i came here compel to keep other peopl away from this place

matt im sorri sir but you fuck up big timeupon entri  we were not greet prompt for dine we were shown tabl for 6

 lot of park good locat but i cant recommend this place yet  
ps  paid with cash but no one knew what happen with our chang we final got it
but yesth place is still weird to mewell this will be one of my last review for 2011 and i hate to say it is not a good one we came here one night for dinner alway want to check out new place in the neighborhood so veri horribl and disappoint                                                the place look like a poor decor 80s place  no one to greet us when we walk in then when the guy cameit was as if he just start that night and did not know where he would sit 2 peopl there was onli one other tabl in the whole restaur   they were apolog to them sever time in the night for mistak that were made in their order as well   7 differ peopl came to our tabl to see if everyth was all right that is just not cool at all  our food was serv on ice cold plate so even though our food was warm it went cold veri quick  no one there seem awar of how to run a restaur at all                                                        mayb they should just stick to the bar busi   i would never go here again and i would not recommend even tri this place  there are too mani good choic out there dont wast your timei have to agre with the rate alreadi post here we just complet a veri interest dine experi and one that i hope not to repeat ani time soon 

first of all there was no greet upon entri it hard to identifi where we should posit ourselv to be seat sinc the host podium blend into the nondescript interior we were seat prompt but i was struck at the lack of ani semblanc if design at this establish i consid myself to be a minimalist but decor here is too spars even for me  there was noth relax or excit about it 

i knew the experi would be rocki when the paper menu of appet was place befor us  realli  paper menus way to make a first impress then when the dinner menu was deliv one page went to my husband and the second page went to me it took us a few minut to realiz that we each had half  whi we onli got one menu for a parti of two is beyond me 

mi main critic is that the place lack a vibe they are go for a theme but it not well demonstr ok there is a martini shaker on the tabl but how doe that tie into shot the server explain that the shaker they serv are basic mix drink  what  your server should be abl to adequ explain your concept and inspir guest to order someth fun and uniqu  

the food wasnt bad i enjoy the complimentari hummus the bruschetta was tasti but the bread it was serv on was too thick 

i had to chuckl when the server ask if he could remov ani plate and i told him he could take the center plate and my husband he then swoop away my plate while i still had bruschetta in my hand  rooki mistak  

we wit two coupl leav  one when they were ignor and never got seat and the other after examin the menu also a famili of three left after be serv water 

last  as we depart no one said a word no thank for come or see you next time noth  

mi advic  hit up the vine across the park lot they say  hi and goodbygarlic  shot is a disgust dump that i will never patron even though i live in the neighborhood we went on a saturday afternoon at 3pm for a late lunch sinc we bought a groupon for 30 worth of food for 15 it was a particular hot day in arizona and the restaur was veri warm insid becaus they were not run the air condit cheapo they onli had the door prop open and it was stuffi and muggi 

first impress other than the warm insid temperatur was a foul odor and the place was dirti and disord like it hadnt been clean from the night befor  we were greet by a apathet hostess who look bother to help us she said we couldnt sit in the regular part of the restaur due to a parti that we could sit in the bar keep in mind it a saturday afternoon and we have a 14 month old babi with us it hot insid the restaur and it smell 

we reluct said wed sit in the bar we ask for a high chair for which they had none we were also treat like they were annoy that we were there so now we are a famili with a small babi for which there is no high seat in a hot stuffi foul smell restaur where we are forc to sit in a musti bar that visibl dirti and were be treat veri poor so we decid to leav sinc the whole experi was uncomfort and the physic dirti of the place was not appet 

we told the manag we were leav and he didnt seem to care at all not onli is this complet disappoint becaus this restaur is in my neighborhood and i was look forward to eat there but the condit were unaccept for ani diner babi or no babi food need to be kept at an appropri temperatur and if it was that hot in the dine area i can onli imagin the kitchen the dine area need to be clean plain and simpl if the dine area is not clean then the kitchen cant be that clean either last custom should be treat with respect and if your go to call yourself a restaur and you are open for lunch then buy a coupl high chair 

so i cant tell you how the food in this dump of a restaur is becaus we left and prompt through the 15 groupon in the trash we wont ever be go back there it was a dump when it was john henri and it a bigger dump now 

if you like bad servic in a dirti foul smell restaur this is the place for you enjoywas in there a few week ago bought a groupon we ment a coupl of friend there for happi hour the bartend ignor us we had to ask for a menu and the bartend had six peopl and sat behind the bar do paperwork  we had to ask for anoth round of drink and the bartend seem annoy with us so we ask for our check and never got to use our groupon this place will be lucki to stay in busi for 6 monthi love the carlo obrien in phx  i thought it would be the same  not  the place is nice and new  servic was ok  food was just flat not good  got combo 15 chicken chimi with queso rice  bean  bland bland bland  

mi hubbi got their one of their special 2 corn beef taco  omg the total for 2 taco was 1804 no price was post on their special list on the tabl  sinc it is a st patrick day special we thought 5 to 6  he said he did not like them at all  the shell had a weird tast and the corn beef was not flavor at all  

lesson learn  alway ask for price if not listugh we realli should have read the review befor come here

w decid last saturday night to ditch the arcadia or scottsdal dinner scene and drive up to cave creek for the even thank good for the great weather and live band outsid at herald that we could hear from our outdoor tabl 

when we arriv we ask if could sit outsid we saw seat avail when we were walk in the hostess went outsid and then came back to let us know there were none avail and we would have to sit insid then walk away not want to sit insid all i saw was an ugli red interior and a huge empti restaur i ask the other hostess how long the wait would be luckili she went outsid and there were two tabl for us to choos from thank good for her

w ask for water right away that came about 10 minut later they did have a nice beer select howev my beer was room temperatur hard cold when we order i made sure they had bbq sauc as that what i dip my hamburg in weird i know  she said that was no problem so our meal came  appar they discontinu carri bbq sauc my burger was just ok my fri were good though my boyfriend steak was bare edibl he said his bake potato was the highlight of his meal

oh and not that this matter but we found grammar error on the menu and the menu itself is quit basic in food offer noth uniqu at all

i think this is the first onestar review ive ever given howev it was sad a huge disappointok so i agre his place need to decid what they want to be  i like the decor chang and was actual excit about the german menu and realli like mani of these option  ala last time we went in menu back to standard cave creek barmexicangener fri offer  oh well decid to give it a tri anyway   took some time to get initi servic despit be quit empti  order some drink and app  app came out befor we got our drink ok then the waitress drop a wineglass on the tabl complet shatter it  still ok these thing happen

then the wheel came off  we move to a new tabl as our was complet cover in glass and the server tri to move all our drink that were on the tabl at the time of the incid to our new tabl  we were like those may have glass in them too could you bring us new one  she say sure then anoth server come over and tri to give us our glass shard contain app back

that was it  ill wait for new manag befor go back  if this is go on right in front of the custom i shudder to think of what may be go on in the backi was so excit to find out that a new casual beer bar was come to the neighborhood i look past some of the recent negat yelp review and hope that my experi would be better unfortun at the end of the day cold beer  cheeseburg just did not deliv 

as for the beer select it is fair decent includ one of my favorit beer bell two heart 

with a beer bar i would expect that the server have a minimum requisit amount of background in the beer they are serv ala the bartend was more of a miller kind of drinker and an offshift server who was a loud bar patron demonstr an even lower familiar with the beer be serv 

be that it is a newer establish i can look past the fact that the server didnt know their product that left my end opinion signific reliant on what kind of burger was deliv 

i had a 12 bacon bleu burger with onion ring if im go to have a burger that cost more than 10 i expect a ton of qualiti and a lot of flavor neither of which was provid the burger fell apart on what i thought was a cheap qualiti bun and the meat tast as though it was sourc from the discount pile at basha in the same plaza 

if you are look for a qualiti beer experi in the area save your money and go to four peakalright ive been here at least 4 time this is the most bi polar restaur 

i will say this the food is good but not so excel to the point of put up with aw servic and chao and it overpr so make sure you use a groupon here which are frequent offer  which i take as a sign of busi troubl if that the onli way you can get return customers

anyway we came in dure happi hour our server was absolut clueless a recur theme with the server here he couldnt answer not one of our question he didnt know what a cucumb roll was ive had this issu here before

our plate were not clear onc dure the entir meal nor were our water refil even after ask a few time we just kept stack our dirti dish to the side hope someon would pick them up no one did

w had to wave our server down for the check and then wait forev for it upon receiv the check he had charg us 10 for 2 cucumb roll serious it rice and cucumb that i get for my kids

i disput the charg and he said there was noth he could do so natur i ask to speak with a manag our server not the manag who wouldnt speak to us came back and said oh i guess my manag said he would just charg you happi hour price for the roll ok that all i want and he had to make it a big damn ordeal also i see the manag look at us just total annoy he even walk by our tabl a few time and wouldnt even smile or say hello

yeah there are just way too mani great sushi spot to put up with this bs i cant even believ ive allow myself to be subject to it more than oncbad bad servic is the summari of this review i was here on a saturday morn around 930 and norm had a pretti good crowd there were a few empti tabl mayb 1 outsid and 2 insid but it was close to full we walk in parti of 2 and were seat at a small 2 top along the window as we were seat our drink order was takenand that was it after twentytwo minut without a glass of water or a simpl have you been wait on we walk out it took twentytwo minut to decid there would be no need to return to norm of all the employe that shuffl past go about their chore not one could be bother to offer their servic 

yucki do not want to even give it one star but i think i have to   while recent on vacat in arizona my mother my sister and i decid to check this place out for a quick lunch  we chose ground control over the other 2 option in verrado for a few reason 1 my sister had a groupon there 2 we have been to both the verrado grill and to the pizzaitalian place befor and want to tri someth new and 3 we were look for someth pretti quick  
as someon who has work in restaur and the custom servic industri for over 10 year i tend to be a littl more forgiv than other peopl i know when it come to servic problem in a restaur howev this was absolut terribl  i say this becaus the onli peopl who appear to be work were the manag and 1 server and with 4 other tabl i can understand a littl slow   we sat down around 1230 pm and quick order drink and an order of the artichok dip  our drink came out within a reason amount of time but the artichok dip which you can tell is just microwav took near 30 minut  befor the dip came out we place our lunch order which was the follow a cup of soup for my mother the tuscan chicken sandwich for my sister and the the astoria salad with no chicken i am a vegetarian  after about an hour of wait for our food and with no drink refil i went insid to look around and see what was go on  i could not imagin what was take so long especi when we onli order one item that realli need to be cook  when i went insid i saw not too much happen it was not busi and the manag and our waitress were just chitchat at the bar complet oblivi as to our frustrat  i sat back down and final the waitress came over to let us know that they were short staf in the kitchen someth i total understand but would have like to know after wait 20 minut final after wait about an hour and a half my mom soup and my salad came out my sister still had no sandwich i begin to eat my salad and my mom tri her soupit was cold  my sister take my mom soup insid and ask to get her sandwich to go  at this point we are all so frustrat and just want to leav it had been almost 2 hour the manag come out with the soup and sandwich to go and i take mayb my fourth bite of salad and what do i geta piec of chicken unaccept in my opinion  after that the waitress came back out and said she took our soup and salad off the bill and ask if we still want to use the groupon which my sister did becaus she said she will never go back 
sorri for the long review but it was such a terribl experi that hope the ground control staff can learn fromdont throw your money away by eat here 
i realli want to like this place  especi becaus it near my home and i want all the local busi to succeed  howev ive given this place multipl chanc at correct the problem they have and theyv fail each time 
their bar and drink servic is good and they have a nice inventori of premium beer  their locat and interior is also decent  that where the posit end 
food the menu is good  execut is horribl  they need to replac their chef and hire a profession cook who know how to consist put out food that isnt either rawundercook or burnt 
order the angus beef burger on three separ occas separ by at least a month each time to see if they improv  burger came out raw one timehad to send back  they gave me a 50 discount for the error
next time burnt  the burger was so bad burnt that it imposs to believ the chef and the server didnt notic with the smell and smoke come from the plate  sent it back  they took it off the bill  
fri they come out rawsoggi in the center  you can tell they use frozen product and they dont qualiti check their plate befor serv  this is a failur by the cook server and most import the manag 
yesterday i tri falafel that was on special  im not sure they know what the definit of a falafel is mine was made with some kind of dough that was not made from ground chickpea or fava bean  perhap corn meal  either way the falafel ball came out cold and raw in the middl  no season and in a storebought pita cold and dri bread that broke open and spilt my food everywher  sent it back and it came back the same way  they didnt even bother make me a new one  they just refri my sentback falafel ball hope i would be happi with a hotter version of the same thing  again it was raw in the middl  they gave us a 50 discount becaus not onli did it come out in error it took them 30 minut to serv our food in the first place  this on a weekday dure a lunch time 
in summari this place kitchen has a failur from the top which is manag that ignor food qualiti and servic issu  when they discount or write off our bad food we get absolut no apolog by the manag on duti  this tell me theyd rather lose money than address problem  i dont see how a busi can surviv much longer like thispleas verrado ground control owner go into your locat and see what go on food is bland  servic is not up to par  we have onli 2 other place to eat in verrado so your make  becaus of that reason and that reason onli do you want to be a pub that serv beer and semi good martini or a great gastropub that serv both great food and drink we as verrado resid need you to care about qualiti and our loyalti as of today i cant enter your establish and eat a simpl quesadilla that so easi to make tast good but your cooksi wont say chef  destroy it  realli  is this what you want in verrado  you need better manag or owner need to wake up and smell the coffe next door listen to your reviewyou can pretti much copypast all the previous commentsreview here too  

lazi servic undermismanag dirti poor product  unfortun too becaus they have the tool and opportun to be a realli realli neat nich  the gc in litchfield park is way better  cmon ground control get your manag act togethohso  more like no so stuffi atmospher less than excit menu and waitress had no idea what she was talk about this is a micro breweri your staff should at least know what a beer tast like not just vodka cranberri out of a red cup plus she got the order wrong three time and offer a sampl of beer i was unsur about and proceed to charg me for the flip sampl without mention it not coolafter read glow review of caballero grill we chose to make it our late sunday lunch big mistak sinc this is a new restaur we expect some thing to not be right but not all of the food the servic was accept if not a littl slow especi for a near empti restaur the food was terrible

first let me be clear we do not use much salt at home when we cook and we do not like salti food and even avoid certain restaur black angus oliv garden etc becaus the food is alway too salti we start with the dip trio the guacamol was not bad but a littl bland we ad salt and it was somewhat better but still need spice the tomato salsa was littl more than water there was no dippabl substanc to it and veri littl flavor the mango salsa was their tomato salsa with a littl bit of mango cut up and place on top the salsa itself had no mango flavor at all 

we receiv our entre i got the pasta de parilla due to the great review on here and my dine partner order the top sirloin let start there the top sirloin was suppos to come out on top of mash potato with a grill portabello mushroom on top of those and then the pan fri steak on top of the mushroom it came out without the mushroom when the waitress came by to check on us he point it out and she said it was suppos to come on there that she miss it then she ask if he was good or if he actual want the mushroom he said that he did want the mushroom she left and had the kitchen grill up the mushroom a few minut later she return with a plate of grill mushroom they were not portabello mushroom and were not cook well they were hard to chew almost leatheri then there is the issu of the steak it came out with a chipotl sauc and butter on top the butter would not melt becaus the chipotl sauc was cold cold sauc on a hot steak that wasnt the worst of it all he could tast with the zucchini was what he describ as cook fuel like a can of sterno would make food tast he did say that he felt like the meat was prime as was claim it just was not prepar proper the mash potato did not have ani salt or spice in themat all noth on the plate was salt there was just no flavor

now we will move on to the pasta de parilla bland if it wasnt for the southwest black bean most like from a can that are in the dish there would have been no flavor to the garlic cream sauc the beef that was on the dish was dri out and tough the grill chicken was dri out but still tender and the fish of the day whatev it was i was never told was extrem fatti but yet still was dri out and was actual crispi the onli flavor to ani of the meat came from the gas from the grill that they were cook it on the pasta itself was cook well but each piec of the rigatoni was so big that it was a bite to itself in other word you couldnt have a piec of the pasta with a piec of meat it was one or the other

when we were done tri eat we look over the dessert menu it was just a list of a few dessert some alcohol coffe drink cognac and port there were no descript of the dessert themselv just the name like big chees brule we could tell that they were probabl just packag dessert brought to them by the sysco truck we were told that they onli decor them there we pass on the dessert we also made sure to pick up the busi card of the chef and souschef on our way out we will avoid ani restaur where they work

w live a littl less than 10 minut from the restaur by the time that we got home i had to run to the bathroom not a good end to a bad meal we will not be back to this restaur and will not be recommend it to anyoni realli enjoy the food and ambianc of the restaur and initi thought the waiter was great and veri help my problem with the restaur came five day later when i was reconcil my credit card statement for the meal i charg my credit card and left a veri generous cash tip of 25 on the credit card statement i left zero on the tip line and the total of the meal was enter in the total line when the charg came through on my credit card mysteri the bill had gone up 10 i immedi inform the manag of the error which he was abl to resolv howev he state that the way i wrote a dollar sign and zero may have been confus my problem with this is that the total was clear written and with the cash tip the waiter mistaken thought his servic was worth a 42 tip are you kid me a word of advic either pay cash or save your receiptoverpr flavorless cuisine
cut dine room but that all they have go for them right now

sid note there is noth that i hate more than a restaur recommend the most expens item on the menu when ask for suggest i find that practic to be decept and of poor tast i realiz that a restaur is in busi to make money howev there is a fine line between that and gain my trust and acceptance

th portion i got for what i paid was ridicul small and complet flavorless i order take out and sat at the bar and was not even offer a beverag while i wait for my order to be readi i guess you cannot teach peopl to be hospitableyou either are by natur or your not

i was veri excit about this concept when i saw it was come in the promenad the owner of the restaur have lot of work to do if they want to succeed in the finicki scottsdal dine marketwe went there for our anniversari we wait for about ten minut while hostess noelia gave us a tabl by the window to celebr that was realli sweet and made a big impress on us then it went all down hill from there it took 20 minut to get our drink and my husband went to the bar himself to get our drink after that i was serv two total differ color and tast appl martini one the waiter brought and the other my husband order the bread basket came cold and without butter the soup was luke warm and even thought we order our steak medium well they were so red they could have move off our plate  i spoke with the manag on duti i believ his name was adam he brought me out a new drink and said he was comp the other one but my husband alreadi went to the bar to get our drink and he never came back with my 2nd drink  we were still charg for the drink and never got the 2nd one which we alreadi paid for by the end of the night my husband didnt feel like talk to anyon anymor so we just paid our 14700 bill and left we also paid for spinach we never receiv this is defin an anniversari we will never forget  i was look forward to go here and i am embarass for our former mayor who put his name on this restaurantthi place will never make it should have gone to texa de brazilwher our origin plan were madeworst restaur experi ive ever had

i was so excit to tri this place sinc it walk distanc from my hous  own by heart  soul café which i realli enjoy  this restaur is go to give heart  soul a bad reput if they keep do busi they way they are now  

we went this morn with friend that were visit and about to leav town  the waitress wasnt veri attent which would have been fine if we would have ever gotten our food  we order right away sinc we had 2 infant with us  our compani want to get on the road  we wait 1hour 15 minut for our food which we never receiv  after about 30 minut the waitress complet stop come by our tabl so we had no idea what was take so long  we all had empti drink  never got a coffe refil or anyth  we final track her down to ask what was take so long  was told the kitchen just receiv a bunch of ticket at onc  was back up but all of the food was start to come up  there were onli 4 of us but for whatev reason tabl of 2 were come after us  get their food  i had a direct view into the kitchen  they were so disorgan  the kitchen staff was fight  yell at each other loud enough to hear in dine room  wait staff was go in yell at them it was veri unprofession becaus it was all in view of our tabl  we were listen to their fight the whole time we were sit there

w final decid after 1 hour 15 minut  absolut no communic or servic from our waitress that we had to leav  the babi who were be angel were start to get restless  our friend were past when they need to be on the road home  when we told our waitress we were leav she just said sorri then walk into the kitchen  yell dont make the food for tabl 30  so after all this time we receiv noth but the word sorri  find out that they still hadnt even made our food  the restaur was not near busi enough to even begin to make an excus for have not even made breakfast that had been order over an hour befor  then the fact that noth was even said to tri and make thing right when we left  i will be veri surpris if this place is in busi long they had an opportun to be a great neighborhood breakfast place  i would have love for it to be but i will never go back here after the poor servic we receiv on so mani levelthis was among the most disappoint dine experi ive had  ever anywhere

th pizza are lamin in greasi shred mozzarella from sysco that the countri largest food distributor not a town in itali  the salad are made with garbag sysco produc  meali tomato flavorless mix green asparagus that resembl bamboo  truli appal for a restaur that claim to know what it do with food  it insult frankly

from the moment you walk in the door there terribl ignor servic  where do they find these peopl  in las vega where there are plenti of server with ton of solid experi we had an incompet waiter who couldnt answer ani of our question about the ingredi on the menu  i do feel sorri for incompet peopl but not when theyr meant to be help me order in a restaurant

what weve got here is essenti a glossi slight upscal domino  it a lot of smoke  mirror with cheap ingredi and terribl servic  they should be asham of themselvdistrito review

today we tri father day brunch at jose gars distrito in the saguaro hotel in scottsdal first of all what you would consid brunch was non exist it was simpli order a regular meal and charg for everi item portion were small and the qualiti of food was not what i would expect from an iron chef for exampl the carn as ado was minuscul dri and unappet the benedict was made with brioch which did not translat well the mahi mahi taco were smaller then i would expect from an appet but they were serv as an entre and the list goe on the drink were tasti but serv in tini glass and way over price  worst of all the servic throughout the entir experi at best veri poor all in all we would not recommend or come back again to this restaur  it is  a disgrac to the iron chefwe will tri again in the futur but essenti onli set back 60 for a pitcher of margarita and a round of drink for two of cours we order eat but food never arriv 

a bit surpris there was not a tequila menu although we luckili didnt drown our sorrow nor our wallet wait on the food unfortun just wast our timewait and waiti use to love barrio café but i got tire of their price go up and the food qualiti and servic go down so i stop go there 

i decid to give barrio queen a tri tonight  big mistak  after be seat and wait over 15 minut i final had to flag the hostess down to say that no one had stop by to take our order  waiter came over and said he was stori that no one had told him peopl were seat in his area  i didnt realli understand that has there were onli 4 other coupl in the entir restaur eat and it wasnt like he couldnt see for himself that someon was wait 

he recommend a chees fondu for an appet  chees was ok but it came with a laughabl amount of chip  6 chip on the plate to be share 

then anoth long wait and more wait  then the food arriv  was just ok  noth realli excit  most of the taco i tri had no flavor 

half way into the meal i flag down the waiter to ask for someon to refil our water glass  he said hed be right back and then he just disappear for about 15 minut  then when he walk by again i remind him that we want a refil on water  again he said hed bring the water  so anoth 1015 minut went by and he never with the water or a check  i final got tire of wait and went to the front of the restaur to ask someon to find the waiter so that i could get the bill  never did he apolog for the extrem poor servic i paid the bill and left and will never return  as i was leav i overheard a coupl in front of me discuss also what poor servic they receivwith a name like grassroot basic you would think that hospit would be part of the custom experi not here unfortun  the ownermanag is arrog and basic a bulli he doesnt take feedback well nor doe he train his employe proper to delight customers

i was here for a busi  meet 4 day ago  the food was ok servic was ok  i saw they had shrimp poboy on the menu and told my husband about it  i brought him here just for the poboy but unfortun never made it to the food sinc the overal custom experi up to have drink was not great

w made a reserv for a booth but when we got there they didnt have one  they said they couldnt guarante one whi didnt they tell us that on the phone
w sat at the bar to have drink then within 10 minut got move to a tabl no offer to help us move the drink to the tabl  

we ask to speak to the manag when he came over he was tap his busi card on the tabl he immedi had a an attitud he spoke to my husband tell him that he didnt train his employe to help move glass to the tabl and he look at me and said what about you huh not sure what that meant but i told him i had come here the other night and brought back my husband to tri an item on the menu and he said keep em come like i should keep come back we paid for our drink and left

moral of the stori here just becaus you own a restaur doesnt mean you should it a custom servic orient busi  if you are not good at that dont own a restaur or be smart hire a manag and staff that can provid great custom servici hate this place i think that i had the worst club experi ever here and ive been to some pretti ghetto club i came with a bunch of girl and a coupl of guy on a saturday night everyth was go great got in the guest list line and made it to the front of the line with half an hour to spare befor guest list was over it was 11pm and the list end at 1130pm and open bar close at midnight so i figur we were set to get some free drinks

th bouncer made us wait in the front of the line for half an hour until guest list was over then prompt us for 30 dollar each for the guy i was outrag they let the girl and i in for free so we decid to rush to the bar for free drink 

when get to the bar i ask the bartend if it was still open bar after she said yes i ask for 8 amf and tri to charg me 98 dollar when i told her i want someth from the open bar she pour out all the drink in front of my parti and went to serv someon els 3 minut later she came back to us and when i tri to order she said she would not be serv my parti for the rest of the night wtf this was my first time in vega at my first club too 

when i complain to the bouncer outsid he dismiss me i will never go back here ever againa sign advertis low calori andor carbohydratespizza display behind glasspick a slice for oven reheatingpay rough five per slicereh and readyquit thin the crust and breadingthin layer of chees harden ontast blandspars sprinkl of top for a larg slice of piemak a pizza thin as possibl with littl top as possibl but explain it low calori and low carbsummnonot a fan

first of all the az republ review john stanley should be asham of himself for the fals advertis and mislead advertis of this review  what a disservic this review has proven to be as well as ruin this review reput  the onli conclus i can come to is this was a paid review as there is almost noth in the review that was accurate
second breakfast is onli serv until 1030am even though their vast menu is onli 4 item consist of  sunshin on a cloud take 15 minut of prepar biscuit  gravi sausag or bologna biscuit fruit  granola yogurt parfait  
the az republ review glow describ the sunshin on a cloud so we order it took 40 minut to get even though we came  1015am when there was onli one other coupl there could never get a clear answer as to whi it took so long to cook but it was horribl just the same the muffin was stale and dri and the yolk so overcook it was like a hard boil egg when we point this out to the waitress she apolog but state becaus breakfast was no longer be serv i couldnt get it made over are you kid me
when this waitress realiz i was get upset she pathet offer to allow me to offer someth off the lunch menu if i want as a replacement
third  the expans 6 item lunch menu consist of  chicken egg or ham salad meatbal grill chees or pbj with the offer of a side salad or soup  person i dont eat premad salad sandwich  unhealthi and all made with mayonnais ive never like meatbal and the kid friend grill chees and pbj i would never buy at a restaur 399 when i can make these at home for 20cent  i pass on the lunch offer and was still charg for the breakfast
fourth accord to the review the bakeri good is what attract the nearfar travel of custom well  they were out of the cake no pie today the 2 lone bar in the case look like they were day old the minicooki look decent the size of your thumb but the price of 299 per dozen stop me cold  no bread today but i could special order the waitress state and the muffin well i had one on my breakfast and it was stale and dri so no to that as well
that it that is the entir menu  
fifth the hour for serv breakfast are ridicul you are onli open until 230pm daili and you onli serv breakfast until 1030am your breakfast menu is onli 4 item and your lunch menu is onli 6 item and 5 of the 6 item are all scoop out of a contain onto bread  i know overwhelm preparation
do not wast your time on this place and along with the other negat review post on this site i dont give this place anoth 23 month befor the east valley is rid of anoth overpr horribl food  daddi girl need a hobbi restaurif you plan on come here dont arriv an hour befor they close the server dont seem to care at all if your wait to be greet what i would like to drink and most of all take my order and get my order right i wait near over 20 min to get my drink order then i liter had to stand up and see all the server hang around the cashier laugh and not give a damn i said out loud can i pleeeeeas order the next reaction just stun me all three just look away and look down as if they were check their phone and count money serious after one server was finish with whatev bs she was do she walk up to my tabl like noth and ask me what i want to get at this moment im alreadi disgust by the servic here i told felisha my server a short stack of macadamia nut and carrot cake also portugues sausag and egg for an extra charg i substitut with egg white from how thing are go i also ask for two to go box becaus i wasnt go to stay much longer wait is riiiiidicul here

mi pancak came and unfortun both were tasteless and dri even with all that syrup and cream chees top then my server bring the egg white separ and the portugues sausag separ im like you have to be kid me right doe she not know i came here befor and order this veri dish to know she mess up on my order sinc she never came around after drop off my food i wave down to catch anoth serverbuss and ask him doesnt the portugues sausag and egg come with hash brown he look so puzzl and slowli said yes yes wait a minut then anoth five minut later my server come by and said oh i thought you want them separ i told her no i order the portugues sausag and egg entre it doe come with hash brown right she goe yes here you go and was about to turn around and walk away not so fast i told her excus me she turn around and i go sinc i order the entre it includ a side of pancak doesnt it she goe yes it doe i look at her and she look at me like yea so i told her soooo am i go to get a side of pancak or  she goe well what kind you want im like whatev kind come with this entre she goe well we have buttermilk or for an extra charg red velvet i told her i just want what come with the entre if i didnt say anyth she wasnt even go to bother correct my order and think i havent dine here more so think i dont know what this entre includ not that slick sweetheart im go to get what im pay for not half ass that right there was wrong done not nice to treat a repeat guest or ani guest for that matter the hash brown was semicook portugues sausag was over cook and extrem dri like burn wood chip the onli thing that came out good out of this experi was the egg white i cant believ the servic here and the worst part is it wasnt even busi at all unacceptable

thank good i ask for my to go box it came in handi and again i had to ask a differ servercashi if i can get a contain cover for the syrup and cream chees this place should be call long wait that stack up becaus obvious that all i experienc here and of cours the sneaki server felisha that tri to get away in not offer me the pancak that came with the meal lazi even though it the last hour you should alway treat the guest as if they are your first middl or last they are still your guestthis place is a disast avoid it at all cost for the follow reason 

1 they lie about the price we call and ask for the price multipl time and were told 17 per person all day when we arriv  the price had magic jump to 28 per person

2 the server are racist they will not give you good servic unless you are korean this appli to other asian as well that they look down upon chines vietnames filipino etc and if your african american or hispan forget about it they will pretend not to see you when you tri to call them multipl time and walk right past you this lead into 3 

3 the server will do their best to deni you meat refil they will take as long as possibl to bring your order to save money slow servic mean they lose less meat and less money so theyll snail it as much as possibl expect 3045 minut wait per plate

fin and most import 

4 the waitress pour steam hot water on my mother hand a flippant sorri and they were gone

food review 35  5

i had the stuf cinnamon french toast it was good but seem overpr at 1200 a good breakfast in phoenix but not anyth amaz banana and vanilla flavor went nice with the toast and the portion were larg plus 5 for the side of bacon



overall

wyknot would have a desir dine experi with much better servic there are other breakfast place in the midtown and arcadia neighborhood i would visit befor this onei was realli look forward to this place open and hope it would be good but now im tri to decid between one and two star i think two star would lead peopl to believ there someth worth go here for ive been to the one in ruidoso and i rememb it be a fair bit better noth ive had here realli has much flavor if this is what these guy consid qualiti bbq they either dont have tast bud or have never had real bbq

the mac  chees was horrend ill normal put up with weak mac  chees but this stuff make kraft seem gourmet and flavor 

the corn is waterlog and liter had no flavor 

you can get better sausag from the old ladi give out lunch sampl at sam club

th tritip didnt have ani flavor i expect some kind of spice or beef flavoror i dont knowmayb some smoke sinc they claim they cant stop smokin it just wasnt good 

save your money and go somewher elsthe girl and i decid to stop by and give this bbq a tri we walk in and look at the food and i turn to them and said i think we should turn around walk out and go to anoth restaur be the nice thought women they are they decid that we should at least give cant stop smokin one tri so we did 

i want my lunch hour money and palat back please

1 the turkey was veri dri and there was no flavor of smoke or of the dri rub nor was there ani hint of a smoke ring it shatter when touch with a fork when i smell it it smell like a combin of the hot cheap plastic wrap it had been wrap in combin with some sort of slight off pork product

1a the turkey was sticki when chew it stuck to my teeth then turn into some sort of gummi past with a graini textur i ate less than a third of my portion befor throw my hand up in defeat and it was a struggl to get that far my friend kept laugh at my facial express while i  was tri to choke it down

2 instant potato instant realli boil up some sucker and take a masher to them peopl and the gravi from a packet wasnt that great either salti salti salti i can feel my cell shrivel up as i type

3 the sweet tea tast like the contain had not been proper clean or sanit a slight musti moldi tast linger 

4 the hostess was eat at the entranc and ignor custom we did not receiv a greet or farewell

5 the layout is somewhat awkward but had the food been good i would have navig a complex maze 

5 no condiment on the tablesuntil we left and the hostess brought them outand hour after the restaur opened

6 the checkout attende was not quit on the ball caus some confus with our payment we request that two meal be paid for togeth and they were rung up as just one meal caus the her to chase us down for the remaind of the bill

wer there ani positives

1 the lemon for the tea were huge juici and fresh

2 the barbecu sauc tast no wors than ani generic one out of a bottlebut no better either

3 the green bean were edible

4 i have a doggi bag full of food for my pup that the human couldnt manag to choke down

how would i sum up my experi ill let my friend statement do that for me

her i have barbecu sauc on my finger

m lick it off

her i dont want to put that stuff back in my mouth onc was bad enoughwe order from this place becaus we were in the mood for some italian and heard good thing about them we werent sure if we were out of their rang so we call to ask the guy on the phone was rude right off the bat ive been in the food busi and knew that dure lunch time thing can get hectic but start off with a negat attitud is never a good start on the phone we ask if we were in their rang and he said yes we order the food and he neglect to tell us how long it would take after about 30 minut i call to ask how long and he rude say he told me 45 minut i dont recal it but still no reason to be rude after an hour and 20 min pass i call again and he tell me look we are veri busi you will get your food soon just wait ok we are a veri famous place you are lucki we are deliv to you  wow im so sorri my lordship i didnt know your special pizzeria was some world renown establish  needless to say we cancel our order and will never recommend this place 

do           not              eat           at       maestro             pizzeriatwin peak and scottsdal were made for each other after take a much need day off with a buddi we decid to take in happi hour at twin peak i should have known better after be at the yardhous dr sever month earlier and see the open team come in for a meet befor they open they all look miser and the look of utter contempt on the blond girl face is someth ill rememb forev 

i digress

i was dress in board short tshirt and rainbow that how i walk in i saw a visibl sneer on the hostesss face as she look over my veri comfort and veri function attir forgiv me gir but befor you condescend to my attir consid that i have work 7 day a week for a year straight and decid to take a day off at the pool your a hostess not the fashion polic 

that sort of set the tone for the place  we got seat and it just sort of felt like be in a strip club most of the server look like they hate their live and arent have fun the manag look like a sleazebag and the girl are just there to get tip the girl makeup look like spackl appli with a knockdown knife and they use fake name our server was flat person wise anyway dri bore and pretenti honest while i love to mess with pretenti snotti server i had been at the pool all day was quit sunburn and just want some cold beer a littl food and a friend server   

when i ask what beer they had on tap she act like i ask her the formula for the circumfer of a circl i had to get up to go look at the beer select and it not print on a menu anywher happi hour menu is 1 off the beer yep that it 

so we order the bbq nacho and two beer i like cold beer but when it turn into a beer slushi im not so hip on cold beer she said the nacho were one of the best thing on the menu realli ummmmmm ok  

this place is a bust see what i did there great big boobi great big attitud and veri littl substanc if your 22 and think you can go hit on a server and score this is the place to test your game if you score you gotta post it ill bow down at your alter of game if you like good food good servic and a qualiti happi hour i can recommend about 5 other place for you tilt kilt is better than this place by a larg measur four peak a local breweri would be anoth solid picki alway enjoy this place prior to it remodel the staff was alway nicenow i must say it the worst mcdonald ever they never seen to get my order right food is alway cold and never fresh for all who want to complain i final was abl to get a correct phone number 6024049785 spoke to the so call manag mariciela while i was explain the situat she was not even pay attent just giggl while i was speak didnt seem to even care never again will i go here for anyth even if it free just wish i could give a negat stari cant believ the review on this place we reciev big jimmi flyer in the mail so we thought we would stop by and tri them out first off it was gross watch peopl cook the pizza eat while prepar the pizza and answer the phone  not onc did i see someon wash their hand and it gross to be eat while you have custom in the store watch you but they didnt seem to care we got home with the pizza and bread stick  euckkkkkkkk the pizza was doughi  the sauc had a horribl tast to it my husband end up throw it all up we wast a whole and half of pizza no one could eat it the crust had so much garlic on it you could not enjoy it at all this place is a knock off of hungri howi which i am not a fan of but id rather eat howi than big jimmi the review from other they must not have tast bud at allnasti nasti nastyw were so look forward to a good pizza but this place ruin it for usman tsing tao is garbag you peopl are so quick to throw 4 or 5 star around i just bought a home in the area and need someth quick and easi to grub on while i unpack not in the mood for pizza so i grab a flyer from my door and dial tsing tao

i order 2 type of chow mein tangerin chicken rice and egg roll my order came out to 30 bone the deliveri was on time but whoever pack my order did not includ chopstick fork or napkin i call back and mention to the owner that the reason for order out was becaus i hadnt unpack ani kitchen stuff and had no clue where the box with silverwar was he told me that to save money tsing tao assum that all hous had their own utensil what the fuck chopstick and napkin cost almost noth you cheap bastard i have never had my chines order come without these simpl things

w ate our food with fuck steak knive until my chick came home from work i ask her to grab some plastic fork on the way

th food was downright terribl no flavor all the meat were overcook msg citi egg roll were raw insid all 3 of us agre that tsing tao was some of the worst chines we had ever experienc i dunno if it was becaus i had just eaten realli good chines the day befor desert jade or what but fuck yuk i will never give these cheap bastard my busi again all you fucker on here need to explor a littl bit more becaus noth that i tast was worth 2 star for realz mane tri desert jade then go back and tell me tsing tao is worth more than 2 stars

p the fortun in their cooki were garbag tooi was so excit to see anoth nonchain eateri open in our neighborhood my first visit was great and each time thereaft has gotten a bit wors 

visit 1  i order a blt  it was great  pile high with bacon and the fri were steakcut and cook perfect 

visit 2  i order a 4 chees flatbread over the phone she insist that she need my credit card number for phone order which i dont like do over the phone for secur purpos upon pick up my order i had to wait 15 minut to get to the counter to pick up my food becaus of the line by the time i got home i live 13 mile away my food was cold on top of the cold the flatbread was not cover with chees the outer inch and a half had no chees on it and was hard as a rock a 5 grab and go pizza from littl caesar which i dont like would have been better

visit 3 order the blt again becaus i want to eat someth i knew i like this time they onli had 2 piec of bacon on each half of the sandwich the bread to bacon ratio was far to low disappoint on top of that the fri were undercook and soggi doubli disappoint 

visit 4 i order the slider howev after tast my husband mac n chees dure our last visit i ask for the fri instead of the mac n chees the mac is dri clump togeth and bland and of cours they mess it up they substitut the onion straw for the fri instead of the mac so i got the fri and the mac the mac was gross just as it was the last visit and the fri were undercook and soggi also like the last visit 

three strike and your out the spot i shall not be returnhave previous rate this at 5star i want to updat my review to reflect my experi here the last time and explain whi i wont ever be go back

aft my girlfriend graduat she went with her friend to postino to celebr over a bottl of wine they left to do some shop and decid to go back to postino and have some food and second bottl of wine when they return the manag said they were drunk could smell liquor on them and refus to sell them a second bottl of wine it worth mention that this is a group of 4 who had onli had the first bottl of wine earlier and they even had a design driver when they explain that he either has them confus with someon els or is just overreact he was rude and extrem unprofession not to mention it was pretti embarrass for them to be treat like that

needless to say they left and went to joy ride next door but the stori doesnt end there the manag actual walk over to joy ride and talk to the staff in an attempt to get them to refus servic to them at joy ride thank they did not listen to him and they were abl to order food and drink this is when i met up with them and tri to enjoy what was left of what should have been a happi day

if i could chang my rate to zero star i would 


update

just move to temp and was realli excit to find a pho restaur so close was a littl weird out nobodi was there on a friday night waiter was nice and we order 3 bowl of pho and i got a smoothie

smoothi was made with expir rotten milk the waiter said oh well i smell it to check if it was okay and it seem fine he said i wouldnt have to pay for it so i order a drink from the bar instead took a peek in there and found a nice live bug float around on top 

at this point we were all sick to our stomach didnt eat ani of the pho they brought out becaus who know what is float around in there i told the waiter about the bug he sigh and said oh fuck i just told him we were leav and we still got charg for the pho we didnt eat

al around terribl experi got to hold my sister hair as she threw up from disgust when we got home thank pho caoso there i was

tri to get lunch with a coupl of friend a lunch that would never happen we drove up to find a rug look park lot with sign bar custom from drink liquor in the park lot and jäger bottl in the window that shouldv been the first red flag but we got out the car and saw a woman who said she was the health inspector who was here to inspect the place we laugh and made joke but still walk in 

we were greet by a waiter who seem to be the onli person work and there was onli one other tabl fill in the entir place we order a sandwich pho lemongrass chicken  spring roll we were never ask for our drink order kinda odd move for a bar that happen to serv food we were nibbl on our spring roll as we saw the health inspector announc herself and head into the kitchen near a half hour later we were onli serv my sandwich and the rest was still come we wait some more time and want to pay for the sandwich and leav when the owner came and bag my sandwich and hand it to me 

we were bewild and after ask some question it turn out their health inspect didnt go so well and they were get shut down the inspector didnt even let them make our lunch i cant say how the sandwich becaus i didnt exact feel like eat it my friend who ate the lionshar of the shrimp spring roll said they were okay except the lettuc and cabbag was old and brown and the shrimp tast of cardboard im write this at the end of the day and happili i can report that none of us experienc ani tummi troubl from the compromis food 

to my yelper i say i cant even tell you to skip this place becaus they got shut the hell downi have to say i am quit frustrat with the servic of the place this was around 1pm when my girl and i went there we had our seat and there were liter two other custom insid so there shouldnt have been a long wait time after we made our first order tuna poke we then had to wait 15 minut to just get that on the flip side all the other guest are be servic immedi we first thought that mayb they had a big order so we gave them the benefit of a doubt then afterward more custom were come in and all the chef start make their order 

  we soon notic that the chef would take our order from the waitress then place it to the side and then start make order for differ guest that have been wait a lot less time for everi one order we did get to the tabl which werent mani they would sling out 3 to four order to the other custom i wish i taken video of this this was just a bad experi from the begin to the end the waitress didnt even acknowledg that weve been wait a lot longer even when i polit ask about when the order would be readi all she said was soon and then walk away i didnt show ani sign of be mad we just paid our bill and left

  and come from the custom servic industri i am veri lenient i would happili pay more for good servic even if the food was not so greatafter read review on yelp i thought i would give this ayc a tri with 8 of my friend i was extrem disappoint we all order and the first thing i order was a spici tuna cut roll onc my friend start to receiv their order complic special roll  i was expect my order but it was no where to be seen i was veri patient and decid not to ask the waitress sinc i thought mine would be follow soon 

10 minut after my friend receiv their roll they start to order anoth round i then ask the waitress about my spici tuna hand cut roll and i cant make this up this is the respons i receiv you alreadi order that and it come so you want to order anoth one befor you get your first first of all i dont need an attitud i was just ask whi i havent receiv the one item i order in the past 20 minut onc everyon els start receiv their second roundi final get my order  

the rest of my parti was finish up eat so i didnt want to order ani more sushi instead i order green tea mochi ice cream you would think that should onli take a coupl of minut nope not at sushi koma so after 10 minut pass they bring us the bill and still no green tea mochi ice cream i ask the waitress and i got anoth smart respons you alreadi put that order in with the other waitress it come at that point i was furious and didnt say anyth becaus i didnt know what horribl word would come out of my mouth

obvious this place did not care about communic and custom servic to top that off the long await sandwich werent even that great 40 minut later i was out the door and was obvious dissatisfi dont go herei dont even know where to begin  we came in on wednesday and realli enjoy our food and servic  we enjoy it so much that we decid to return last night sunday  it was clear busier than it had been dure the day howev the experi was not what we had hope for  we check in with the hostess and were told the wait would be 1535 minut  we decid to put our name on the list and grab a drink at the bar  they dont have pager so we want to stick near by in hope a tabl would open up  it took near 10 minut for the bartend to notic us at the end of the bar wait to order a drink  i will say we all enjoy our margarita but the wait was a littl much  as we finish up our drink we realiz we had been wait for 45 minut at this point  check with the hostess stand and they said anoth 1015 minut  wait wait wait anoth 25 minut went by and then we were seat  we were surpris becaus we notic multipl vacant tabl where we were seat and wonder whi we had not been seat sooner know we could have been in and out by this point  we first thought perhap they were all reserv  but we did not see anyon sit at ani of these at ani point  we start off with the guacamol and then order our entre  our server return quit some time after we had order our entre and let us know one of the item we had order had been 86d for the night  we wonder whi it not onli took him this long to let us know but whi our entre order were be put in after so much time had elaps at this point there were three peopl at our tabl and one person order came out first  the server was apologet but she finish her entir meal befor mine and the other person came out  the time could not have been more off  the food was not as great as the first time and neither was our experi  our server was kind but full of excus  two of us at the tabl work in a restaur and understand thing happen and problem do occur  howev we both felt it could have been handl much better  we wont be rush back here anytim soon if at allthe food may be good but i wouldnt know sinc this place ask me to wait for over two hour to be seat for a tabl for three  to be fair we went in on a friday night around 700 with no reserv  there were quit a few peopl wait for tabl and the restaur was overflow with peopl  i place my name in with the hostess and was inform it would be a 4555 minut wait  fair enough  seem like a reason amount of time to wait on a friday with no reserv we wast time by walk around scottsdal quarter and have a juic drink at true food we ventur back to sol and were abl to find a spot at the bar  i had the skinni margarita which was tasti enough but noth special my guy had the hous margarita and he said it was averag  after an hour of wait i went to check on our tabl the hostess said it would be anoth 25 minut for our tabl to be readi  we were enjoy the peopl watch but grow hungri nonetheless we decid to wait sice we had alreadi wait this long  after anoth 35 minut my beau who is not as ration as i am went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet anoth half hour at this point we were look at a two hour wait with no end in sight how could we trust them not to ask us to wait anoth 30 minut we left but not befor my cranki guy chew out the manag mayb you could chalk this up to the grow pain of a new restaur or the inabl of a young staff to proper gaug the wait and manag their tabl but my experi left me thorough disappoint and i will not be go back to tri the food ani time soonworst servic and sandwich ive ever had at a subway  jare wouldnt come herei am realli a glutton for punish i suppos the coupl of time i have made the mistak in come here the onli reason i have even step foot into this store was becaus is super close to my hous i rememb the horrid smell of rot veget that stank in the produc section whoa i am glad i had an empti stomach otherwis i would have lost my belli junk 

stinki and the floor are constant dirti black mark all over the place they have clear just given up on ani sanitari decis regard store clean the employe are alway unfriend bitchi and sullen on all occas 

if i could kick my own as i would have for make the same mistak over and over by come back out of conveni well at this point i would drive 100 mile elsewher to get what i need to avoid this assault on the nose and horrid sour milk smell

smel bad bad bad bad it ef is so foul i would rather shove my face in a skunk juic box rather than inhal this funktitued

forg me i am just bitter the experi was scar and that badive heard lot of good thing about this place and sinc i was in the area today i thought i would swing in and grab a bite to see what all the hoopla was about  

the menu itself is ampl with a varieti of select but i swear i wait half a lifetim to place my order  i was hungri and we were the onli one stand there so im not sure what the holdup was but i start get ansi  eventu a ladi took our order and we sat and wait while our food was prepped

i went with the 3 chicken strip fri and a drink combo platter and my friend went with the wing plate himself  overal the food was good but i was a littl irrit with the long wait  

also part two of my experi was a combin of the crabbi ladi behind the counter who took our order and the bathroom situat they kind of go hand in hand  for starter she was kind of rude and cold to me  i wasnt sure whi but it got wors as the lunch went on  

mi break point with her was when i tri to use the ladi room onli to realiz they were out of toilet paper i came out to the counter to mention it to her and i basic got complet blown off  for starter the guy mix wing behind the counter total ignor me when i start talk  then the rude ladi heard me poke her head out from the back saw me and went back behind the wall to finish her convers on her i phone i couldnt wait ani longer so i went into the men room sinc appar whatev i had need was of no import to her

aft i was done i came back around to the counter and she was done talk on her cell phone i told her she was out of toilet paper in the ladi room and she scream over her shoulder to some guy to go take care of it

i can deal with a wait for the food but the crabbi ladi just make me think twice about come back here along with no toilet paper in the bathroom as well  the food is okay but i just dont know about do a drive down here again for this placeupdat lower my review to 1 star id give zero star if i could i explain in my first review how i purchas a gift certif through my work discount program for employe and a newli chang polici is to no longer charg the 18 gratuiti howev when i came to atl wing on friday they forc me to pay that gratuiti my work contact them about illeg charg me and atl wing actual gave push back now keep in mind the compani i work for is not some tini littl noth busi it the largest corpor in the world for it industri and atl wing is so arrog they think this may not effect them let me tell you atl wing in my build alon i work with near 2000 peopl who most of which resid in mesa gilbert and chandler word of mouth is a veri power tool this restaur is now be report to wwwrestaurantcom to be taken off of the program for employe to purcahs gift certif clear they have no respect for their custom they onli want as mani dollar as they can get even if this mean go against contract they sign with other compani and ignor polici that are givenlast updat  i got an email from restaurantcom this morn it offici sinc atl wing doesnt know how to respect  their custom and they ignor their contract and polici with restaurantcom they have been remov from the discount program i was allow to get anoth certif to a differ restaur in exchang for the hassl we went through 

atl wing my employ gave you the opportun to fix this but you decid that it more import to overcharg your custom with invalid fee just so you can keep the extra cash you took the gambl and you lost on this onewhere do i start i honest rare leav a bad review and never had a bad daili deal site coupon experi befor let start from the moment i walk in actual rewind befor that so you get the whole pictur after play a softbal game i was starv and did not want to cook at home so i pull out my trusti phone and wizz to my daili deal coupon app i had at humbl pie liter i drive across town to eat here with my mouth water as i walk in the door i get hit with a funki smell at first i thought it could of been me sinc i was play softbal in 110f weather but wait it wasnt  me the smell was sewag i pull up my pant said well i drove across town and i am starv so i will just ignor it after i wait for about 5 min no one came to seat me so i just sat myself at a tabl about 10 min after that i final had a waiter come over and take my order must of been a test to see if you realli could stand the smell like one of those hidden camera show  i went to the bathroom to wash my hand befor i got my meal the bathroom was below averag was not horribl but more like colleg dorm room bathroom where you are happi you have soap and roll toilet paper the food came out pretti quick after that the salad and pizza i thought were pretti small serv more like kid menu item but i did not care sinc i was starv but it tast alright at the end i waiv my waiter down to pay the bill i told him i had a daili deal site coupon and he said no problem sinc your bill was below 20 you just have to cover tax the waiter said he would have to get the manag to run the promot deal the waiter came back 5 min later and said well you order a special so you cant use your daili deal site coupon unless you pay full retail i was thrown back with this becaus i did not order special but just an everyday item i ask to speak to the manag the manag came over i told him what happen the manag was confront about the situat which total threw me off track i was like dude your place smell of sewag bathroom could be clean more than 1 time a day someon could greet you as you walk in and last  learn to  manag the situat better in the end i debat with the manag for about 5 min over the situat and paid the tab to get out of there so for over 5 disagr over the bill this compani has lost a custom for lifehit genghi few day ago with gf and three other  we were plan a wild and crazi night of bingo at the sunset station sinc the cash ball bonus was call my name  we get to the restaur at 530  place is busi so we opt to eat in the bar area  bingo is at 7 so this give us suffici time to go a few round  at least that what we thought  bartend was attent with the drink we even got lucki sinc there was an nfl game on so happi hour price on beer

sad we get up to the food line and it 10 deep sinc they onli have 1  buffet  line open  were told the 2nd line will open soon for the dinner rush  were stand in line at about 545  when doe the rush begin   6  7  sinc the place is pack at 530 here a crazi idea  open the 2nd line 

so we get through round one  onli complaint on food  they were low on a few item and my usual complaint about the place  small bowl  when we gave the bowl to the cook he ask if we want the food to go  we told him no

so time for second round  it 615  we figur we have a 12 hour to get our food eat then hit bingo  this time the line is about 15 deep  still onli one line of food avail  wtf   i ask the guy refil to ingredi  whos the manag of the place and he point to a guy man the grill   ill share my concern with him later  in the meantim the line is move at a snail pace  and of cours im mid way fill my bowl when they open the second line  thank thank a lot  

given time constraint when they ask if we want it to go we say yes  by the time we get our food we have 15 minut to pay and leav and get to bingo  while get our stuff togeth i ask the bartend for our bill  put the  with 20 tip in the bill folder even though not pleas about the time issu and the bs of onli one line

th manag come over to ask how everyth went  i express my disappoint about the one food line  she advis they open the 2nd line when the place get busi  the place was busi when we walk into the restaur  nice tri  she then inform us we cannot take the food to go sinc we got the bottomless bowl she had to make the smart remark it post in the restaur  it might be  i didnt see it nor was i look  then whi have the cook ask if we want it to go   they should ask if we have the bottomless option then ask about togo

if we cant take it to go then bill us for the one bowl option   thank she agre otherwis i was realli go to lose it   i get the bill folder and pull out the tip

f u genghi grill  youv lost my busithis place took forev  the whole wait staff was unprofession and disgust in appear  i wonder if they even wash their hand the kitchen staff had nice cloth and wore a smile  it took 40 minut to get our food the food was semi decent but not up to par bummergenghi grill has figur out a way for their server to do absolut noth alreadi there was no real kitchen for them to maneuv and now they dont even serv wateryou get it yourself they were also out of straw on the day i recent went realli your complet out of straw not even for the fishbowl drink you have that a mark of poor manag not keep simpl necess like straw in order 

i was sort of in a love affair with genghi grill when i first move here but realli it is not that good they have cut so mani corner sinc then that it not even fun to eat here i want full babi corn dammit not cut up that i can bare tast it or get it on my fork 

i would rather have panda express or pei wei than this crapola passso final they open a golden corral in our area  for the longest time those commerci actual made me want to visit one again  in texa they have golden corral everywher it no biggi  howev peopl here seem to think it a realli good place to check out  

mi advic is dont go unless you have 2 12 hour to wast  on top of that it so annoy becaus 4739827432798 kid are run around unattend make all kind of nois  the food wasnt even that great i onli went there think that they might have someth differ offer  after find out this locat is like everi other golden corral i was veri disappoint 

the steak were veri hard to eat after tri to insert my fork to begin cut a piec  the fork bent and felt like put a fork in a piec of rubber  the difficulti made my experi even wors especi becaus 5 kid kept bump into my chair and yell in my ear  i actual had to tell the parent to control their kids

i dont care how inexpens it is or how mani peopl said it was delici  becaus in that area there are plenti of nice restaur with no wait time and will fill you up the same way for 30 which i paid there  the pasta was disgust the sauc were not even right  there were a coupl thing they did well everyth that was a fri food and all the chicken  

i would stay away from this place if your not tri to eat salti or greasi  becaus a lot of the dish are heavili season and veri greasi  the worst was the spanish rice it was too salti to even digest  hope they improv their qualiti of the dish it shouldnt matter that a lot of peopl line up to eat there and the restaur is super busi  the food  servic should alway be good regardless of how mani peopl show up

food d
servic cmy hubbi and i have been want to tri gc sinc it open in our area he had rave about one he visit in or a coupl year ago and couldnt wait to take me 

we tri to visit a coupl time but were turn off by the insan looooong line so we left we figur that mayb our time was just offnop this place aaaaalway has a line out the door 

so we final decid to suck it up and stand in line tonight which wasnt as long as befor so the wait was semitoler we werent in line but 3 min when some guy who had step out for a smoke tri to excus himself through the front door to get back to his tabl and was stop by some big bur dudewithatud this guy was like 3 time the size of this littl old mani mean come on your serious go to pick a fight with a man who is just tryin to fin his way back to his famili so from the getgo the experi wasnt veri welcoming

aft wait approx 15 min an extrem short wait time for this place onli becaus it was just befor close time we paid and sat down the light was so bright i swear they use daylight bulb in the drop down lamp not exact the ambianc i would prefer while eat dinner out with my family

i sent my hubbi and babi to the buffet while i use the littl girl room to my horror none of the stall had sanitari toilet seat cover or toilet paper good thing i carri tissu in my purs but what about the other patron that dont ill leav that i your imaginationand statist about 35 of american dont wash their hand after use the toilet as if that isnt nasti enough while i was use the facil i was forc to listen to the woman in the stall next to me regurgit her dinner so gross 

tri to get past my disgust i sat back down at the tabl where my hubbi and babi were enjoy their dinner i told myself if they can enjoy it so can i besid we alreadi paid so i didnt realli have a choic 

so i heard the main reason peopl visit gc is for their steak but i cant eat red meat so there went that the other food was mediocr an most of the noodl dish were swim in goo 0

to top it all off befor i sat back down at the tabl i spot an ant crawl across the tabletop at that point i just choke down my food and tri to enjoy my famili compani 

overal not a place i will ever visit again nor will i recommend it if you enjoy wait in long line with low class peopl and dont mind wipe your butt with your handthi place might suit you otherwis steer clearthis place get crazi pack and the line are ridicul it out the door and when you final get insid the door there is anoth line wait i had to wait almost 1 1 12 hour just to eat here and it was all hype becaus this is the first golden corral to open up down here so of cours those entic commerci we see time to time on tv make peopl super excit for this one but from my experi here this is what i have to say about this place

 long line  ridicul wait
 overhyped
 drink are not includ with your meal
 understaf and they couldnt handl all the custom pour in
 area was not clean  dirti tabl were left around
 wait 30 minut one time to just get to the grill steaks
 peopl would be eat in the line barbar or kid will be run around with food in their hands
 peopl are rude but hey when your hungri you tend to get grumpy
 food is wayyyyy too salty
 dessert were tasteless and stale 

the onli good thing was their steak the chef cook it to a perfect medium rare but  after everyth i had to go through to get the steak no thankdisgust and unsanitary

i it possibl to give a restaur no stars

iv gone to this restaur a few time sinc incept at the puent hill mall locat and the more i come to eat the wors the custom base becom and the more disgust i get

whil peopl were stand in line to be seat they have alreadi start eat with their hand  that mean that bacteria they have on their hand will transfer to the serv spoon when to go for their second third fourth  then there these peopl who are so happili think how cool it is to hold their strawberri befor stick them to the chocol fountain again it call spread germ peopl  the staff see these issu and dont correct or replac the food

i will never go to this place again

manuel r is correct their name should be chang to ghetto corralgolden corral has grace las vega with it mediocr buffet in a citi that is known for everi casino on just about everi block that has a buffet

mi husband and i decid to throw in the towel and tri this place out after month of see the park lot full to the brim and line out the door we saw it wasnt too busi on a saturday afternoon

first impress you get your beverag befor you pay you are herd into the establish like cattl and lo and behold you enter complet and utter madness

pro  select is decent dessert are plentiful

con  food is mediocr the place is too small and it is a madhous 

appar the golden corral doe not do a good job tell it guest to corral their children although there are sign post that say children must be accompani by adult at all time this suggest is thrown out the window children run rampant in here without parent supervis knock into peopl plow their way into buffet line the adult here arent ani better there no rhyme or reason to how peopl get their food there no line to speak of it an allout brawl fest  almost

cleanli is an issu my husband and i search for a tabl and could not find a decent clean one we had to wipe one down and remov dirti napkin just so we could have a place to eat we also watch as a famili with two small infant allow these children to sloppili plow through food and fling said food all over the floor  it was gross

overal  never againlet me start this off by say my review should be a littl bit bias i was an invit guest of the casino have dinner with employe of the casino and have the meal along with my flight and stay paid for by the casino if we receiv ani special treatment at gordon ramsay i shudder at the thought of the treatment of the averag customer

th food as everyon els say is great sticki toffe pud beef wellington etc all wonder there not much to add here

th servic is some of the worst servic ive receiv in ani restaur anywher to receiv this level of servic in a fine dine restaur is a travesti it took us an hour and a half from our seat time to be serv bread 

the main reason for the one star is the spectacular handl of a terribl situat by our waiter denni after order he neglect to ask i told him i had a shellfish allergi he said my order should be fine my beef tortellini had some small piec of fish next to it so i assum the best took a bite it tast like scallop when denni came on by i ask him what it was the convers follows

denni oh yes those are scallops
m i have a shellfish allergi i told you i have a shellfish allergy
denni well just dont eat them
m it doesnt matter i alreadi did theyr right next to each other and i told you about it
denni oh it wasnt cook with it you should be fine just dont eat it

and walk away

thank my allergi is mild and onli make me nauseous i wasnt pay for the meal or i wouldv made a gigant scene no apolog were offer in fact that was the last we heard of itwalk in at 530 hope to grab an earli tabl with my fianc we were told noth was avail we ask if there was a wait list for cancel or miss reserv and was told in a veri arrog manor we are fulli commit for tonight and tomorrow night as well you can tri and eat at the bar

w agre and made our way in what a madhous at least a half dozen other parti walk around circl like vultur watch peopl eat judg how long they would be even if i like the idea of play music chair to get a tabl i defiant wouldnt want to be hassl the entir time i was eat by other do the same

th worst part of it was the dine room was half empti what a joke

th staff i spoke to was extrem rude and the bar area was one of the most disorgan place ive seen in vega had vibe i would describ as sheer panic

i use to have a lot of respect for chef ramsey he talk a lot about qualiti of food and servic but befor i could even tri the food the servic left a bad tast in my mouth im sure i will give this place anoth tri with a proper reserv but for now when peopl ask me this place is somewher to avoidcant tell you how much i was look forward to the dinner at grs  now let me let you know whi it is a must avoid

steak  order midrar and that is how it was cook  howev the steak was tougher than chuck norri on steroid  
side  roast fingerl potato  these were good but the fingerl doe not roast as well as other  and i hate purpl potato use for roastingthey look aweful
              mac and chees   not much flavor here  veri bland
              fri green bean   these were tasti  a bit salti but i like that
              onion soup   tasti  too small of a portion
              shrimp cocktail  this was possibl the worst ive ever had  no flavor and  
              complet overcooked

drink  rusti nail  bartend nail this  pun intended

sid note  my girlfriend cousin order a ribey midrar without char and it came out look like minecov in char

al in all not a good experi  the steak should have shine and it was no where close

sid note 2  the design of the restaur should be commend  the interior was greati love sushi pure and simpl i did not love this place even though i love the concept if you are a sushi fanat and want fresh melt in your mouth fish this is not the place for you 

i had three differ sushi dish  tuna salmon and whitefish  all the fish was dri and tast the same my husband pick up four differ roll  hawaii dragon spider and crunchi spici tuna  with except of the sauc they too tast the same we thought the seawe nori wrap was veri chewi and tast funni the gyoza and the inarizushi stuf tofu skin were actual the best thing we had 

servic was friend and effici i like how you know the price of the item by the color of the plate it is on  it is kind of like a revers cafeteria instead of go through the line the line goe to you  among the typic offer like sushi and roll they also have dessert tiramisu cream puff cheesecak jello and fruit salad

think and then think again befor you trek here weigh the choic    price vs qualiti the price was right the qualiti wasntoverpr overcook out of cole slaw out of corn bread and oh yeah i had to take wing becaus they were out of chicken  i got the 8 piec meal and it smell rancid  so bad my husband wouldnt let me eat it and threw it all out i ate one piec  a thigh  and the meat was dri and the skin was ooz greas sure sign that the greas was not hot enough when the chicken was cook  so sad i realli look forward to it cest la viedecid to tri this spot outi mean whi not flavor flav open it 
well let start out with yes the menu is veri limit i heard the cashier say that they are go to add on to the menu in the futur it is what i expect it to look like for a small take out chicken joint it could of had some more fun flavor flav custom to make it look betterbut it is what it is 
now on to my gripe  the menu is over price and to top it off the chicken wasnt even worth it my bf and i paid 15 for an 8 piec and it was so freakin salti like so damn salti i dont even know what to compar it to i guess if you just swallow a tablespoon of saltit was just that salti like omg even eat it with ketchup and hot sauc didnt help i had 1 piec and that was all the salt i could endur i just feel sorri for my boyfriend who had to eat the other 7 piec in the endi am realli disappoint i thought it would be a bang chicken joint but for me it wasnt i will stick to kfc or popey or harold chicken shack if that is still open hcs is more worth it for the price than this placei had no interest of even tri this place out until groupon had a special when i get there to cash it in they tell me that their waffl machin is broken i realli want the red velvet waffl dammit they offer a larg side so i took the mac n chees it was pretti goodbut
th chicken it tast like i was eat iodiz salt with a crispi skin chicken should never be that salti i will never step foot in that establish againhow doe this place have good review yuck this isnt custard i dont know how peopl think this is good custard me and the 5 peopl i went here with took a few bite and thew it out it leav a waxi tast in your mouth also the place was veri dirtya big turn offthi place has got to close in a matter of timethis was terribl the custard tast so artifici i could bare eat two bite the italian ice was so artifici and sweet it tast like food color and ice barf

luv it is still the best in townsometim you hit magic you know what i mean that holeinthewal joint that where you would never think to walk in the door but somehow for whatev reason you go in that door order some food and you experi some of  the most amaz food that youv had in a long time eg rollin smoke bbq fat choy etc

ok this is not one of those places

thi review is for the asianamerican cafe that is locat insid of the casino i hate to be the bearer of bad news but sometim it just need to happen if you dont believ me go in this place and check it out

i person thought that we have move past this type of food mayb like 20 year ago this might have been accept as mediocr food but now idont think so

i was think about give this place 2 star becaus the cashier ladi was so friend and she seem genuin concern about make sure that i was alright but the food was speak loud too me it was actual shout at me so here we go

5 pho ok let talk about the broth im talk top ramen here peep like water  powder soup base that it mental pictur here noodl pad thai noodl it look like they werent soak and cook proper or possibl they were old becaus they had that slight woodi tast the rare beef overcook well done mean past medium  thick slice of flavorless beef final cilantro on top that all folk plus ive had a tender stomach last night and the whole day today

th owner seem veri nice so it pain me to do this but i wouldnt recommend this place to anyon ive been veri fortun to hit a lot of bullsey in my foodi quest in vega ive also hit some duck along the way quack muthatruckin quacki also join del frisco for their complimentari lunch to help train their staff  i will go into the detail later but for the 20 tip that i left for the servic i would have rather had a sandwich at the local deli  first as you walk in you are greet by a throng of women wear rather short skirt  i had to ask if this was go to be a restaur known for their women server or their food  i think the former  if i want eye candi i would have gone to twin peak or the tilt kilt  anyway the menu was limit and your entir parti  had to share a plain paper menu  i was surpris that they couldnt afford to make copi so that the entir parti could have their own menu  that was the first red flag  then you had to share one appet no matter how larg your parti  so if you order the devil egg and you had 4 in your parti everyon would have 12 egg for their appet  btw their devil egg were veri ordinari  red flag number 2  then for your main entre the parti had to each pick differ entre and could not pick the same one  if this was trueli a train exercis  whi would it matter  i order the green chili burger that had no green chili on it and tast like a fanci big mac the fri were cold  my companion had the salmon which look and tast great  the entir lunch includ two drink would have cost 8000  i had other workmat that also had similar experi  a tabl of 4 had a bill over 14000  if this is suppos to be a trueli casual lunch spot henc the grill name then it is way over pricei rare if ever give 1 star so base you could onli imagin how horrend the food was

cam here with 2 friend and order the sisig lechon and sisig soft taco  

the lechon was so deepli fri it felt like i was eat greasi pork jerki  noth but fat greas and rock hard pork

mayb im not filipino enough to appreci sisig but i had some the other day at salo salo it was wonder and tast like heaven bliss  sisig at this place tast like mush up dog food  it was so mushi i actual contempl give it to my dog but i held back becaus i didnt want to feed him absolut crap

i feel veri bad for give the bad rate but this definit top my list of bad food experi  servic was fine the restaur decor was fine the food was just unaccept  as my friend quot this is also the onli place where we had to ask for box just to be nice sinc we left almost our entir meal on the tablive been here a few time as well as the locat in scottsdal both are alway tremend busi which i can typic deal with ive tri a few thing and realli the veggi  hous frittata are the onli thing on the menu which i feel arent overpr for what you get but their food is good so this is  was  an occasion stop for me 

today though after wait at the counter for near 5 minut someon final came to take my order onli to refus to make me the thing i want 

ye you read that correct he offer me someth els from the menu becaus the frittata appar take to long to make and were realli slam i was beyond stun and left out of pure principl i can think of 9 other better way to handl that situat even wors i think the guy help me was the manag here an idea advis me that there will be a long wait offer me a complimentari drink mayb even bump an order or two ahead of mine so it doesnt caus a backup it wasnt like i was in a hurri  i even brought a book to hang out for a while if an item on the menu is that much of an issu it shouldnt be on the menu 

i realli hope owner perus these review from time to time so they can address this sort of atroci custom servic not that ill ever be back to find out but they might like to know how their busi is be handlif your look for some vietnames cuisin near chandler blvd  rural rd take your first immedi avail uturn and head to pho dalat  my review is base on sage be a restaurant

sag had so much potenti  it locat near cafe krishna on the southeast corner of rural and chandler  a perfect locat to get the intel crowd for lunch  sage is hous in what use to be a few fail bar but it has been complet remodel  there are garag door ala postino style that open out to the front  the patio has been expand with more contemporari furnitur but my compliment stop there

walk in there a dart machin golden tee and jukebox to the right  in the middl of the restaur is a pool tabl  there larg rectangular hightop and a few low top  a weird mix  wait until you look over and see a couch meant for a patio that is cream color with brown stripe  the larg built in seat on the side is in red  the floor is a dark expos concret  the wall are this odd greenblu ting that remind me of avatar skin  we also were listen to some countri music which turn to hip hop which turn to some top 40 

to start off we order tea  whi is this import  they ran out of tea

w order the pork spring roll  they were nice size but the peanut sauc came in a plastic cup  the pork was super dri and i had to lace a lot of sauc on it  the spring roll were lack someth crisp  it couldv use more mint

w got the sage hous special and rare steak pho  the broth was a murki brown that was too sweet with a veri salti underton  i think the chef ad too much salt so tri to balanc with sugar  then ad too much sugar and ad more salt  rins and repeat  the meat was veri well done and chewi  the rice noodl were undercook 

the wors part was after we were done  i stare at the middl of the tabl and i didnt say anyth for a few minut  i was tri to decid if i had to throw up or not

th onli redeem qualiti of the place was the staff  they were attent and friend 

sage has the locat and it might be a great bar  but when it come to food i could put someth better togeth with a packag of instant pho and some beef  drop the vietnames cuisin off the name and add on asian fusion and well all forgiv the foodsoi work in the club industri as a general manag of anoth scottsdal spot i have been in the bar club and entertain scene for 18 year i would expect more from the manag at this placeto say the least the manag jeff at this place pretti much need to take a step back in time and rememb that we are in the hospit industri 

so for the most part i have heard good thing about this place that it was the new hot spot up north bigger then spanish fli and set up right 

well this sunday me and some friend decid we would check it out and decid we would get a cabana there now grant it was not under my name but it was me and my friend plan to go there and who ever got there first was go to get it

mi friend got there first so i show up alon in casual dress some basketbal short and a golf shirt and some nikeson my way in i get stop at the door the bouncer explain to me i can not wear basketbal short i explain that me and my friend were get a cabana by the pool they were alreadi insid and that i had no plan on hit the pool with basketbal short i mean this is a cantina patio bar  restaur right 

he still say he cant let me in so then i pull the industri card and explain that i am the gm of a club in old town scottsdal and even though we have a dress code except can be made usual for celebr or for vips

 i would consid myself a vipsinc i work the scene i dont go out much but when i do i usual spend moneycas in point last tab at el hefe 200 the mint 450 so it not like i am a one or two drink type of custom i will usual buy a bottl or two  i had alreadi explain that i had a cabana with friend wait insid so one would assum that i am there to spend money

so the bouncer say let me call the manag jeff who come up and say pretti much the same thing and that if he were to make an except for me someon would sure complain and it would not be fair and pretti soon everyon would be come in out of dress code
hello it a pool bardress coder i can go shirtlessbut my short are a problemr 

good thing i wasnt hungryi am assum you must need to wear a suit jacket to sit down in the restaurant

so to make a long stori short i went over to kierland spent 75 on short at tommi bahama and went back and got let in

i went in to check it out and meet my friend servic suckedhad three differ peopl walk by me at the bar when i first walk in befor some nice girl final saw that i had been wait at least 10 minut for a drink  8 for a margarita in a 10oz plastic cupreal 8 ridicul 

then i made my way over to the cabana my friend were at  to say the least they explain the cabana was 300 buck which seem descent but after they heard what happen to me they pretti much all said f this place and we pack up all our stuff and left they had alreadi spent about 160 we probabl would have pop some bottl i know i had plan on that befor i got there and we would of made a go of the place but the manag jeff drop the ball on this experience

thi is the hospit industri buddi to say the least i can guarante you i will not be back to this locat in fact i would like to say i am boycot all old town group busi but unfortun i love sushi at stingray biltmor to much to do this at least they got it right there hospitterribl place

w visit with a group peopl we had a good time in the resturaunt with mo and after drink we went in the back to play pool and chat eventu a differ terribl blond woman came back and complain that our group didnt leav a larg enough tip our bill was 300 and the tip was 50 she was a major bch about it too 

eventu they told us to leav and the same awesom blond woman call me a dick to my face on the way out we check our card the next morn and they overchar our card which is call fraud in most states

stay away from this placewe bought a groupon coupon for this restaur for 25 and it had a valu of 50
now we are local so we can eat all over town from between 1525 dollar   but i took a chanc and we went into this overpr tourist trap   it is locat in treasur island   

first of all we had our kid with us and when we walk through the casino to the restaur they said it would be about 15 min and that we could sit on the bench outsid the restaur   we sat down there and then one of the casino secur peopl came by to say that my children could not sit there that they had to stand in the restaur   i protest but he act like he wouldnt mind kick us out of the casino altogeth so we compli    

onc seat i told the waitress that we had a groupon coupon and that we want to spend 50  but no more and no less  she offer to let me know how much it was as the meal progress and i said great   well the place was fun and the sign on the ceil were fun to read and we were enjoy the tourist flavor of the place  we order but the menu was veri expens   appet were 28  slammer were 13 clam chowder was 8 and a coupl of beverag brought the tab to 67 dollars

then i had some troubl with the waitress take my cell phone then demand that i go onlin to the groupon siteso she could redeem my coupon  i went there after some awkward moment and it was alreadi redeem  then i ask for my bill and a to go box and she brought the bill but after that she went on to wait on other tabl and we had to go hunt for a to go box   

the food the food was ok but not hot the soup was lukewarm   the pepsi was in a tini littl mugth sauc were old and prepar in advanc so the guacamol was dark on top the sour cream had water around it so it was sit in a fridg for a few hour the whole experi was a dissapoint as i didnt expect to have to pay anoth 25 for the balanc of the tab and tip

i will not be return to this place   so after a  long drive to the strip have to park and walk a mile wait and be harrass by secur then find that  this place is price so high that even with a groupon coupon it is a rip offi dont recommend anyon go there   there are so mani great restaur off the strip we have gone to senor frog in mazatlan and puerto vallarta but i dont think their price were so high and at least they cook the food fresh and hotwell 

now keep in mind i have been a fine dine server for 14 year and a pretti darn good one at that i realli wish i could find other hospit staff as dedic to the guest as i am with my own guest definit couldnt find that here let me tell you what happened

not much to say besid this place was horribl i was in vega alon and crave some shrimp fajita when i walk in i ask the hostess if i could be seat outsid she ask how mani peopl i repli just me she said there a bar outsid where you can order food you can sit there if you want i repli umm so i cant get a tabl for one outsid she said no not for one 

now i dont know who this girl is turn down a person becaus they are onli one i tip as much as four peopl would and probabl wouldv tip more that night be i had just won 1300 10 minut befor walk into this place 

anyhow i said ok and made my way to the bar 

onc at the bar i took one of the onli seat availableit was near the end of the bar and appear to be near a servic station oh well i guess i have no choic 

it was a busi night and be i saw 3 peopl behind the bar i assum they would have the servic cover boy was i wrong i sat there with noth in front of me for a good 10 minut no exagger i actual look at my watch no acknowledg no eye contact noth i even said to the coupl next to me how has the servic been tonight they just shrug and said it look like theyr pretend that they havent seen you yet  and they laugh 

as much as i hate do this i wave my arm in the air as if in a tacki chines restaur i even said helllllllllllllllo  out loud final he come over and say yes 

i said hello how are you this even sorri to bother you but may i have a menu he gave me a drink menu and befor i had the chanc to correct him and request a dinner menu he was gone again like the wind then i sat anoth 10 minut wait for him to come back around again which he never did final i flag the other bartend down and said hi i want to see a dinner menu pleaseoh dont go away i alreadi know what i want 

i order the shrimp dish then i ask where the bathroom is his repli was your sit next to it and he laugh i wasnt amus he continu just kid it outsid in the casino i just nod unamused

when i got up and went to find it i never wound up go back 

so i left still starv and veri dissatisfi  asham of the horribl servic 

there wasnt a manag to be found either 

dont wast your time or energi on such a crap shootthis place suck i hate give bad review and more often than not if i dont want to leav a nice review i leav noth at all unless im piss off but this place just was realli bad unlik a coupl of other review experi our servic wasnt bad at all in fact that was probabl the best part of the whole experi 

the real problem 1 no drink less than 11and then the drink werent even good they were small weak and not even delici i had a spici mango margarita and it tast like a regular nonspici strawberri margarita and look like one too not a hint of spice and if that was mango then i dont know what strawberri is i was sooo look forward to that drink too but it wasnt veri good and so expens i wasnt about to order a differ one to see if it was better plus it annoy me especi when your pay that kind of price when restaurantsbar serv you drink in a plastic cup realli im pay 11 a drink and you cant even give me a glass we werent even sit outsid no excuses
2 the food suckednot good bland greasi dri chicken no real flavor

w knew when we went there not to have high expect especi for the food but it was wors than expect and the drink werent good our stomach hurt afterward never ever go backpass

whi is the food here so gosh darn aw such a prime locat with great view of the strip yet they cant give you a decent meal tsk tsk especi at these ridicul price my girlfriend came here for happi hour which is between 36pm no food special but their souvenir cup drink are buy one get one free so rough a yard would be anywher between 1015 for one dure hh 

we share an order of chicken quesadilla steak nacho and slider chicken quesadilla was good nice piec of grill chicken but for some reason it was hard keep it togeth not for the lack of chees but whatev chees they use didnt melt that well to glue the tortilla togeth steak nacho were aw hard ani steak and noth about it would make me want to order it again how can you mess up nacho so easi slider were aw dri dri dri the bun were so hard they were ined we realli should have sent it back come to think of it the patti look like someth that came out of the microwav are you serious 

senor frog has so much potenti such a cute theme and nice fun restaur would be a great place to day drink and have a shareabl meal unfortun it is just all crap if your look for a fun day time place to lunch on the strip id go to diablo at the mont carlo instead 

and what up with their serversbuss you cant promot a young hip restaur when everi is older than my momma

tourist trap take my advic and dont be a suckerwent to señor frog for dinner dure what we thought would be a peak time it turn out to be a terribl experi we order nacho and chees steak as well as a soda and one refill

to start the soda is 6 each the two pop i had were 2 less than my meal the cup were half fill with ice so the pop was veri water down we were offer the unbalanc cup to take home but they were heavili use and ding when get the bill i confront the waiter about the price and he didnt seem to care or make ani effort to resolv my concern

th food we order was terribl bland and i am disappoint this was my last dinner vega the nacho were soggi becaus they put all the top on top of the chip guacamol sour cream salsa fri bean the chees steak was terribl bland and dri with just a thin layer of beef

th restaur itself was empti although we went at dinner time this could be for a number of reason but it meant a restaur with blare music 5 server bother us everi minut and a friend note on the bill that said

tip not includ grasia

i will never return to this restaur and i will make sure that it is never recommend to anyon i ask

eek methink notthis place suckspoint blank period grow up on the east coast live amongst jamaicansi have had the opportun to eat real jamaican cuisineand this is not it the rice and pea tast like crapth textur was overcook and flavorless you cant tell me they didnt use 10 minut boil a bag rice the curri chicken was made with chicken breast not a whole chicken that give it flavor when it cut down to the bone marrow  the curri was bland my curri chicken tast wayyyyy better the cabbag was soggi and again the common bland i had high hope for this place i feel sorri for these poor phoenician who think this is authent island yard flavor will never go here againthis place doesnt even deserv the one star i shouldv known better and save my friend and i from eat here when i was about to check in on my phone but we were hungri and want to eat asap first off horribl servic my friend specif ask for someth to be not on her food and they mess up the order when my food came it was freez cold i never complain about food be cold but honest my food felt as though it was place in the fridg for an hour so i sent back my food to get reheat i could tell it was reheat and just sat there befor it was serv to me again becaus the tortilla for my taco were dri and crunchi yet the meat was still cold i didnt wanna wast anymor time here so i decid to shut up and just eat the horribl qualiti meat the chorizo was okay but the chicken tast fake to me yuck mind you our food took forev to come out the manag was kind enough to give us free chip and salsa guess ill give the one star to the manag other than that this place need to serious work on manag and food quality

oh yeah all of our water were empti for a good 2035 minut and nobodi came by to refil our drink so i liter got up and found a pitcher of water and refil all of our drink custom shouldnt be do thati realli wish i had seen the poor rate on yelp befor we decid to come eat here

th bad

1  we saw our waitress 2 time in the 2 hour we were there  the first time was after sit for 20 minut wait for her to come take our order and the second time was after wait 30 minut after finish eat to have her bring us the bill  no check up to see how the food was or to fill drink at all

2  the charli burrito tast like cheeseburg hamburg helper wrap in a tortilla

3  there is some stupid ladi who come up behind you and tri to put a hat on your head without ani warn or ask  she almost end up with my dinner knife in her leg when she just slam the hat on my head



th good

1  the guy who brought out our food brought out the food

2  the guy who made our guacamol made the guacamole



in realiti there is noth good about this place and i will not be backlet me begin this review by say the 1 star basic goe to manag for handl the situat myself and my niec were in a few night ago when we dine here befor go to see a movi i had never eaten here befor and i did inde check the review befor enter this place but i threw caution to the wind becaus they had less of a wait time than yard hous oh boy that where i went wrong

th hostess were pleasant and the wait realli was not that bad but then we were sat in this strang booth that was complet separ from the dine room and it was on the side of the bar but not a part of the bar either becaus there was a rail between us and the bar 

im not go to complet document our experi but i am go to highlight a few of the more deplor offens the waiter snif my drink to make sure it was dr pepper wtf moment number 1 we order pretti simpl dish becaus we were inde go to see a movi my niec order a blt with the dorito mac  chees side dish i order half a hous salad and the load bake potato with the pull pork we then proceed to wait for 45 minut befor our waiter arriv at our tabl to tell us there was a big parti take up the kitchen and our meal would be out veri soon so we miss our movi luckili there was anoth show an hour later

next we wait again for our food dure this time the manag came up to us and apolog comp our meal and gave us a free dessert

th meal final arriv they brought the incorrect sandwich to my niec she order a blt and it was a turkey club she had to wipe all the turkey off of it the salad was a poor excus for a salad with tini witherl of shave carrot the load bake potato were okay but the drizzl sauc they put all over it were not my thing the dorito mac  chees was serious one of the worst thing ive eaten in my entir life my niec and i both agre would wretch right there at the tabl if we had anoth bite

w then await our cooki minus the ice cream so we could take it to go we wait and wait and wait our server arriv to inform us it was still be cook we alreadi about to be late to the second movi show i decid to leav so we walk out the door our waiter run met us at the door of the movi theater to give us our absolut cold and disgust cookie

sad excus for a place it will not lastthis place is a disast sat at the bar a few night ago and was not impress the bartend are terribl no person and down right rude they even charg me for someon els drink then argu with me when i complain about my bill this place wont last long especi with all the competit in town squarare you kid me  i was disappoint after see all the good review it is fast food bbq if you want a mcrib and mcdonald is not serv them go here do not go here if you want real bbq this place sucktonight was actual our second night at the brat haus  the first time we went for a few beer a game of washer and to tri the bavarian pretzel  they were absolut delici that night  so we decid to go backand soon

w had a veri differ experi tonight  after be seat we wait for 1015 minut befor a server greet us  he said that he would figur out who our server was but took our beer order  when our server arriv she didnt apolog nor did she introduc herself she drop off our beer quick took our order and was off  it was anoth 4550 minut befor our food arriv  my husband order a beer brat someth he grew up with in wisconsin and has made himself time to time  he said that it was pepperi and had no beer flavor and he didnt enjoy it at all  he made better beer brat himself last weekend and the man is no chef  i had order the vegan grain sausag and what i was present with was a soft veggi burger  i was a littl confus but ate it anyway it was rather bland and the burger part of it not at all crisp  i was realli excit for my fake brat so that was a disappoint and frank should be list under the burger section if that is the sausag  we order the fri as well which were ok  we would have love to get them a littl earlier if wed known it was go to take so long to prepar our meals

aft dinner we had anoth round of beer and order anoth pretzel  this time the pretzel we receiv was rock hard and not at all enjoy to eat  we had ask for honey mustard and curri ketchup and receiv honey on the plate  after 2 hour we had final paid our bill and walk quick away from a bad dine experience

th onli posit thing i can say about this place at this point is that the beer is decent but it not the onli place in phoenix with decent beer

im not sure what was go on with this place tonight but i hope they figur thing out  this is exact the kind of concept of a place we would go to regular but after tonight my husband said he wont go backa lousi hot dog stand with expens beer
four of us went for lunch sunday server was great but servic was slow becaus she had tabl outsid and we were insid order brat and they were sever overlook and bad the spici one was so bad that it was hard all the way thru the cook ought to go to ted to see how good brat are cooked

h walk over to chit chat with the bartend girl and then drift over to hang out with anoth waitress he just lean his ass against the counter the counter with a huge stack of pizza box and then got all excit when he got anoth tabl seat  
he tend to them took their drink order and brought their drink and onli then got around to bring us the box that he was ask for 15 minut before


mi review had been 2 star and sinc the same exact thing happen again i took one more awayi use to love this place until i went in for my bbq chicken salad ate half then found a live cockroach crawl around in the salad i call over there and they did noth for me but offer me my money back so i brought the box over and the cockroach crawl out of the box on the counter i work at an offic build a block away with 450 employe which most would go to zupa for lunch sinc they werent take care of a custom find a huge cockroach in their salad i decid to let my whole offic know about it they lost a lot of biz i hope they dont treat you the way they treat meit look like all of the bogus orang head 5 star review couldnt save this place i saw that the sign was no longer there and the place was close for lunch on fridayuse to be a huge jamba fan but now i have found better local las vega place they use to have the chocol mood which they discontinu about 6 year ago but it was still around and consid a secret menu item was quit disappoint when i ask if they had it and they said no becaus they are franchis not corporate

ord the rest of the famili their juic and then tri to use a coupon that jamba juic had sent me a coupon for 2 buck off their new fit and fare smoothi tri to use it sinc they didnt have my chocol mood and they cashier yet again gave me the same excus maam we are franchis not corpor we do not accept coupon wow so what the point of have your name jamba juic if your not complet associ with them 

it would have been more accept if the cashier actual smile or seem sorri that she could not help me with the drink i want or not accept the coupon she was personalityless 

i wont be back to this jamba juicmy husband and i have our favorit italian place but decid to give christina a tri what a mistak that was sinc i had suggest we tri there i felt terribl and apolog to the hubbi yes it that bad

upon read the menu on their websit it look promis we alreadi had a few thing in mind wed like to tri this place is a hole in the wall it look like an old build someon just move into not a problem some of the best food ive ever had was in hole in the wall insid was clean with outdat everyth the tabl are possibl the cheapest thing they could find and cloth chair uncomfort but okay i can deal with that 

we were seat within minut upon arriv and notic onli michell was wait tabl there were 2 other tabl but they left as soon as we got there from the time we order our drink to the time we got our check we were the onli tabl it took her more than 5 minut to come get our order so she was slow but that okay no big deal 

we order fri ravioli to start he had the stuf haddock and i had the chicken primavera let talk about drink happi hour beer price is great alcohol price is compar to ani other restaur i had water which tast like it came straight out of a tap and hubbi got a soda which michell kept forget what kind it was despit the fact that we were the onli one there i felt the food was a bit prici for the restaur but if it good i wouldnt have care 

mi meal came with a garden salad they call that a salad it was ice berg lettuc 3 strip of bitter green pepper and 2 chunk of tomato i got it with their homemad ranch which was realli runni and warm i never use a lot of dress but i had to pour the entir littl cup just to get some flavor with my lettuc i onli ate half of it as the bottom was swim in ranch of cours but still no flavor 

the ravioli the homemad pasta was good and use good bread the insid howev was noth but ricotta and parsley it would be okay if they use some spice but nope just those two it lack flavor like the ranch dress it came with their marinara sauc for dip and hubbi and i took one bite and that was it their red sauc tast and look like noth but can of crush tomato sugar and littl bit of garlic red sauc is stapl of good italian eat hubbi and i end up talk about what kind of jar sauc wed rather have i make my own so that say a lot

michell brought our food and she actual got my order wrong so had to send it back she check her notepad and she had written down the right dish but somehow she told the kitchen the wrong one im certain it was her mistak not the kitchen will explain in a bit his stuf haddock came with two side so he got the sausag and saute spinach the sausag was swim in the red sauc so he had to scrape off as much as he could it was veri tender great textur but again lack ani flavor i tast meat that it the spinach oh dear good it was swim in lemon juic and butter and when he took a bite he made a realli bad face i took a bite while say how bad could spi and stop talk ive never had such bitter spinach his haddock it was small thin and swim in sauc that look cloudi and had develop a nasti skin on top he said the crab stuf was okay but like everyth els just lack flavor the haddock itself wasnt fishi which is good but again no real flavor 

when he got done i final got my right dish the veggi were small and thin slice and altern between okay bite and bitter bite judg by the bitter and how soggi they were im certain they use frozen veget which is not okay the white wine sauc was just butter with splash of wine it been near 3 hour sinc i ate and i can still tast the butter 

small restaur are better than chain but not this one it is complet unaccept to use frozen veget especi for the price they charg when our meal was over she brought the check and there was a 20 gratuiti ad onto it i ask her to take it off as there was no way i was give her a 20 tip but i had to go up front to ask her to do that as after she drop off the check she didnt come back for 20 minut 

oh and how i know she screw up my order  when we were done anoth tabl came in and one of them order a sauvignon blanc but she brought a cabernet she admit she heard sauvignon and brought the cabernet she doesnt pay attent basically

i feel like we complet wast our money on this place im all for tri new place but experi like this make me want to just stick to my usual italian place so run do not walk away from christinai wish they had a zero star option ive been out to arizona from california a few time now last month i went to mill ave and had an awesom time but last night i went to this place and wow appar look caucasian and classi get you treat horribl by the other patron i cant even describ the amount of ghetto that surround me a girl tri to fight me over hold a seat while my friend step away for 3 minut peopl were open smoke weed on the patio and i saw 2 fight almost happen in the bathroom on top of that when you tri to strike up casual convers with men or women you get either crazi look or attitud i think the onli reason peopl dont get stab or shot in here is becaus they use the metal detector wand at the door and obvious for a reason consid their type of custom oh and one of the bartend was rude an old white guy side note i help my boyfriend run a busi for quit a few year and im pretti shock that the yelp owner for this busi left a sarcast comment in respons to someon review here first im serious confus that so mani peopl give this place a good review and second as a busi owner you should never respond to custom like that veri immatur and definit indic of whi your busi is the second most ghetto place ive ever walk in to consid i spent quit a bit of time in south central la that say someth about your establish and customlove the idea  vegan mexican have tri to eat there twice both time check their fb page for hour both time they were close call their phone number no one answer no sign no explan on fb pathetok so i read the bad review on here but i still want to give this place a tri sinc it a new place for revlov sushi also i want to compar and see if it was better than teharu sushi in temp 

well i was not impress at allthey realli need more varieti of sushi roll the whole time i was there i was just wait and hope to see if differ roll would be come my way but nope it was the same california roll salmon roll or vega roll just rotat in circl i dont want to be eat the same roll over and over so becaus of thismi friend and i order sushi off the menu each roll it took them more than 3040 min to make and this place wasnt even pack there were total of 3 sushi chef in the kitchen make sushi tooughi think i was at the restaur for a good 2 and half hours

th sushi itself was noth special i onli like one of their roll and i onli saw that type of roll rotat around once

honest i would not go back here ever againif you want the whole revolv sushi experi go to teharu sushi just sayini dont understand whi there are alway sooo mani peopl in this store i mean cmon peopl it an extrem overpr and unecessarili bedazzl candi store a lollipop with a bejewel stick for 30 lord know im gonna just throw that bejewel stick away after i finish the loliipop who care if kim kardashian is on the box not worth itthis establish is an absolut shame to the other barrio restaur  this was my third and final attempt first time they said they couldnt scrambl egg  i could get over easi but not scrambl the waitress said the cook told her it take to long   make no sens as an over easi egg take longer to make 

second tri they ran out of the bread for the french toast 

today i ask for appl juic  they said they dont carri it   that was fine but when i said i will just have water the waitress was beyond rude to me she roll her eye and gave me a veri sarcast sorri and chuckl  i dont need attitud to eat an overpr 13 dollar burrito   did i mention that i had to go find a hostess all three time  one time she was on her cell  

do not eat here  walk to c gate for the same meal for half the price at fox sport grilldo you think two month of advanc plan would at least get you in the door here  think again

i book our dinner here for a bachelor parti of 14 peopl two month in advanc and coordin with their sale and market manag kristi mendenhal  she provid a contract which i sign to final our reserv and i stay in contact with her up until the event to make sure we were good

on month out they made a minor chang and kick us from our reserv man cave onto mainfloor seating

th night of the even we show up 15 minut prior to our schedul arriv time we didnt even make it in the front door becaus of their unprofession and dismiss secur guard who refus to listen to me eventu the general manag open the front door and i told him about our reserv the manag said he would have to check but never came back we went elsewher to eat that night

in summari we sign a contract two month in advanc 14 peopl drove from out of state for this event and never even got in the door

i even gave them the opportun to make up for the mistak befor take it further and write ani review  kristi mendenhal apolog and said she would send gift certif to make up for the mistak she told me this three month ago and still no gift certif have arriv stay away if you are plan an event here

th good news is after we were turn down at the door we walk down the escal to pbr rock bar  grill where they were happi to accommod us and provid excel custom servicas we went flee from hiscor we ran into one of my cowork who had final gotten there after mass traffic on the 215 well we didnt want her to feel bad and i want to hang out with her some so we tri the next door properti to hiscor the player club

if hiscor is the unnecessari sequel to insert coin the player club is the veri unnecessari sequel to that it is the adventur of lolo 3 of the barcades

w were told the player club was meant to be a more loungey suav version of hiscor and when we walk in it did have a veri mancav feel with cushi chairs

but unfortun the problem was it was too much like hiscor the menu was exact the same the game area was even smaller with a few foosbal tabl and pinbal machines

th kicker was when i order a red bull  vodka i swear this is what went down

m ill have a red bull  vodka
sh is there a certain type of vodka you want
m pleas by this sure can i get skyy
sh okay well get that started
few minutes
sh we dont have red bull we have monster though
m oh that fine
few more minutes
sh um we dont have skyy would you like grey goos belvedere
m realli uh grey goos i guess

so my red bull  skyy has turn into a monster  grey goos fine whatev par for the cours for the night a few more minut pass and im still not kid the dingi server bring me a shot of grey goos and half a lowbal of monster no ice

i hate you i hate you i hate you how do you screw up a red bull  vodka

i actual had to go up to the bartend and ask for a glass of ice i took it back to the tabl threw the shot over it then pour the monster on top and when they bill me i was bill a 7 vodka shot with a 2 monster bump

if they thought they had ani shot of me come back that got bump right off the tablguess i shouldv wore my hater proof shirtloli was sooooo mad when i left heresorri cassi you were total awesom if you ever reloc look me up on yelp and ill go eat  where do i start oh ya sobobbi q messag me after my last expieri apolog about my food and explain they had the wrong oil deliv and to pleas come in ask for him and see their real hospit i thought his messag was awesom so tonight i call ask for the owner and a girl answer the phone and seem soooooo nice told me the owner werent there and so i ask to place a to go order again and thought well if they dont know im a yelper they will show their real color omg and that they did i made my order for myself and my hubbi and then ask if they had a children menu she veri polit repli oh no but what a great idea thank super sweet right so i get there and walk in and it the same ghost town no bodi in sight onli this time there wasnt even a bartend to askbut when i walk into the bar area after wait a while at 857pm i peak around the corner into the kitchen and saw a girl later to be name stephani on her cell phone so i wait some more and decid to give up so i call my hubbi to see if he want someth differ to eat and while i was explain to him i dont know how im suppos to give a good yelp reveiw when histori repeat itself stephani walk out i finish my convers with gotta go babe she final came out  stephani storm over to me and loud say oh i finnal came out huh i was just blown away i ask what the problem was she told me i was rude for say that becaus she had just walk out of the back and i was lie about wait but mayb i should go yelp about that  i told her to check her camera and told her i dont need her attitud and to keep the food im leav then cassi ran out to me and beg for me not to leav while stephani was scream run around the restur say how i had been there befor i was that btch who wrote the yelp review and she didnt need to take my sht cassi told me she had made my food and was new there and she apolog for stephani behavior told me she doesnt know what is wrong with her and after about 5 min i came in hand stephani my money stupid took my food and cassi walk me out and apoog again and as she was do that this crazi girl open the door and ask me if i want my 36cent chang i thought she was go to throw it at me i told her to keep it and told cassi i was go to tri not to write a reveiw but contact the ownersooooo i get in my car and feel bad for not tip cassi so i walk back in to her and heard stephani on her phone say i dont need this sht and your the one who told her to come back so now i question how sincer the owner respons was to me and how sincer they are at all hospit what a joke i tip cassi and left  the food you ask  let just say this couldv been a great review updat  to bad so sad jealousi  or someth is what i chop it up to with stephani she was soooo nice both time on the phone til she saw me sorri not everyon is as bless as me that doesnt mean you have to treat us like sht they might have fix the food problem but they need to work on there night time hospitalitysorri cassi i will never be back and to the ownersi wouldv rather had food like the last time than be badger by your hostess and as a busi owner i would never allow my employe to talk to me or anyon like that this was like an awesom episod of kitchen nightmarummmwhat is go on 

now theyr close on sundays
smoothi menu has gotten cut in half popular smoothi like coco cat cow is no longer on the menu look at my recent pic i post of the menu
drink are split into two separ price now 800900 depend on what is in that smoothi when i first join vega hot about a year agosmoothi were onli like700
no more 100 off discount if you took a class or check in to social media


hav been stop here after my class for about a month now and i dont plan to anytim soon until they chang this ridiculi prefer to think they chose the name tipsi becaus they stay consist drunk enough to tell themselv their food are alright

yum they have excel commerci grade high lecithin amalgam qualiti chocol heck whi bothereven nestl has a higher qualiti chocol mix so i might as well get my chocol fix from a gas station and for cheaper 

i know that most peopl dont understand that white chocol isnt actual sheet white but an ivori color from the high percentag of cocao butter this is crappi knockoff gross high in palm oil that i cant believ vegasian would enjoyar they all drunk too

old sandwich not made in hous too i guess i should tri their coffe but i dont think sothos can be found next to my nestl at the gas barif i could give zero star i probabl would for a varieti of reason  first of all there are mani mani upscal steakhous to choos from in the scottsdal area and noth about ben  jack would convinc me to choos them over other such as mastro capit grill citi hall dominick etc  also have actual eaten at peter luger in brooklyn mani time it was actual depress see this place so poor tri to copi a legendari restaur from the way they serv their steak to the veri weak knockoff of luger steak sauc  

now onto our meal  we had a decent size group last  night for a friend birthday and spent exact 1050 befor tip and about 500 of that was on  wine the other half almost all on the steak  the calamari appet we had was probabl some of the worst calamari ive had in year with capit grill be the best  they convinc us to do 2 order of steak for four which just bare serv the 8 peopl who were eat it  we would have been much better off had we all just order our own steak  it was also undercook which seem like it should be a tough thing to do sinc they slice it befor they bring it to the tabl luger style   the side we had were all mediocr at best includ cream spinach german potato homefri and mash potato  

now for the part that realli shock me  one slice of cheesecak was serv with a candl in it for our friend birthday and that dessert was not comp  i dont think ive ever been to a meal with a bill of that size for a birthday dinner and not had the dessert for the birthday celebr taken care of  it not about the 10 for the slice of bad cheescak it pure principl  

pleas pleas go elsewher if your look for a good steakhous in scottsdal or phoenix  dont wast your money here when there are so mani other good options

the bad order the turkey burger becaus the waitress high recommend it i love turkey burger so i was super excit she promis that it was like omg so good it wasnt it was horribl  i am convinc that they were tri to get rid of soon to be expir turkey or that she get some kind of turkey burger bonus 

the ugli we order nacho for the tabl  they brought the nacho out and we start eat they came back a few minut later and said that our plate was actual a special order for anoth tabl  they took our partial eaten plate of naco and gave them to the right tabl  i wish i was kid but this actual happen you could tell that our plate had been pick at as well  

that has to be the craziest thing that ever happen to me at a restaur  none of us could believ that happen  so grossread is pure on servic 

visit vega to see my famili they all said we need to go to eat becaus of the food wish we would have had a chanc to tri the food this is how thing play out 

1130 am call to make a reserv for a group of 10 at 100 pm i was told that they dont take reserv but sinc i call in with enough notic they would work it out for us to be seat 

1220 pm i arriv earli with my husband to the restaur to put our name on the wait list my husband was told we will see what we can do in regard to seat our group 

1230 pm i confirm with the hostess that we would be seat and the owner came by at the same time and said we would be seat at 100 pm happi to hear this

1250 pm my enter parti arriv and three tabl are open two right next to each other and one in a separ corner and the rest of my group arrives

100 pm other peopl are seat that came in after us

110 pm no updat from the hostess about us be seat and more peopl are be seat that arriv after us 

115 pm my brother call la comida just one block up and one block over from eat to see if they can seat us they said yes i told the hostess we were leav and we all walk over to la comida

veri disappoint on the custom servic and lack of communic grant the locat is small but if i was told when i origin call they couldnt seat such a larg group we would have never wast our time waitkitchen dropout  servic dropout  bartend dropout  absolut no one graduat from this white trash university

a group of about 15 of us came here for a busi lunch which bring up an import point here this is not a busi appropri place  extrem loud music and a meal take about two 2 hour to complete

thre of us left without ever receiv our meal  or an explan  there was no manag on duti and just a coupl potenti intox server and busboy left to look dumbfound as we ask for water

th whole experi was like an episod of jerri springer unfold befor my eye but with ined chees fondu and spoil artichok  

make no mistak this is overpr pool food except it wretch  it just reek of desper  there not much left to sayok so i was so pump about this place that i went a second time and took my famili that was visit from hawai sure the wait was 2hour long but i told them it was go to be worth it yes 3700 was push it which was what we paid the last time we came but i told them theyd get their money worth 

we final get to the front where we pay for out entranc and the ladi said it was 44  automat im think holi crap we were just here and the price was not 44 she said the price chang a few day ago well they should have put up a sign or someth how was i to know that the 3700 was still plaster all over the websit i figur fine we alreadi wait 2 hour we might as well  i ask for a parti of 8 and she said they couldnt do more than 4 per tabl i was in shock i mean i knew that they were busi but one of the ting i love about this buffet when i was there the last time was the big huge round tabl they had to accommod larg group right then and there i ask to speak with a supervisor and even she was rude  she said and i quot  maam you can clear see were busi we cant take big parti on one tabl i told her id be will to wait and she told me it was go to be anoth 2 hour i was upset so i just took it and said fine give us 2 separ tables

so we get to our tabl and get this they sit us near 4 empti huge tabl that seat a part of 8 i was livid i went up to the front and told them about it and they said that they didnt have a server for the section even though it was 2 feet away from us 

oh and it get wors so weve alreadi wait 2 hour in line right just the line alon to get to the food was ridicul i wait for 15 in just for crab leg when i went to the asian section to get the roast duck that i want it was complet empti and had to wait for that too and a lot of the stuff they use to have when i first went there was gone

overal 44 for a buffet bad servic not enough food long wait sooooo overr i wont ever go back i can get way better food for 44 and wayyy better servic and not have to wait as long  wick spoon at the  cosmo is now my new number 1negat 5 stars

mi famili and i got in line around 3ish pm on thanksgiv day  there was a long line alreadi and they told us the wait would be around 3 to 35hr  that not great but was expect that whi we got in line earli  we figur we could still get in befor 7  appar the employe there miscalcul the wait time

th line was move along until around 5ish  that when they allow the express ppl to cut in line  caesar palac want to make extra buck so they creat an express line  20 per person in addit to the 50 price they alreadi rais on thanksgiv day  we wouldv left if we knew the wait was this long  but by the 2nd and 3rd hour we thought we were almost there when we were pretti close to the cashier  but that where the real wait began  we wait and wait and wait and we were not go to leav the line after the 3rd hour of wait  and it would sound ridicul if we paid extra to get into the express line after wait for that long

when i told one of the hostess we wait six hour she was shock  she said shes been tell all her guest the wait was onli 3 to 4 hour  couldnt the employe be more dilig and not made up a wait time  and after 6 hour of wait they told us we would have to wait even more if we decid to sit togeth  so we end up split our parti into two tabl  yeap after a 6hour wait my famili was seat separ on thanksgiv day

with the long wait i expect great food and servic anoth big disappointment

food what happen to the macaroon they alway advertis  there were no crab claw  the cocktail shrimp were soggi  even the sushi was gross  we saw the sushi chef took premad sushi out from saran wrap  that show you how fresh the sushi was  everyth was mediocr  definit not worth 50 and the long wait

servic not great  one of the chair was soak wet caus by previous custom when we got to our tabl  our waiter simpli put a towel on top and told us to just sit on it  realli  it would have soak right thru the towel and to my jean becaus the chair was so wet  i had to switch out the chair myself becaus the waiter didnt even stay for more than a sec  and he basic disappear that night too

in conclus never come back to this place againokso the food realli deserv a 35 or 4 star for a buffet
butbait and switch alert peopl  bait and switch

oki came here about a month after open for a yelp elit event  it was free  it was glorious  now it chalk full of problems
1 no monta ramen  for tourist this is a local ramen joint that is veri popular with the foodi  they hire someon from there to help them with their ramen  it was close to the real deal  last night  gone gone gone  at the yelp event they even had the head buffet chef walk around brag about how much troubl they were to for the ramen  i believ him  so what happen  good thing i didnt pay 50 for this buffet expect this ramen  oh wait50 it was
2 whoever manag this buffet need a demot stat  at even the premium buffet in town you expect to wait for seafood  crab leg etc  most the crab leg take a lot of work and it a bottleneck  fine  
at bacchan they had combin the seafood and carv station line into one gigant line  gigant move slower than molass in the winter too  not onli did that make carv station onli patron wait a veri long time for some meat that were readi to go the long line obscur about 25 of the buffet offer  and most of the good stuff if were be honest  basic if you want fri chicken or ani of the potato ani bread a whole host of thing  you had to squeez your way in between the dirti look of peopl who thought you might be cut in line  how about separ the line  oh waitthey did end up separ  after i complain to a manag and was told im not kid just go ahead and walk up to the carv station and ask for what you need  just bypass the line  whatchu talkin bout willi despit my misgiv  i tri that assum the peopl were all in line for seafood  they werent  i almost got murder by the peopl in line 
on my cat like reflex save me  
also they had 1 chef at the carv station  all the while a huge line was continu to build  here a hint  have anoth person there carv while anoth person take order and serv it up  the ladi in front of me liter took and i time this 3 minut to get 3 differ kind of meat  with like 30 peopl behind her and grow  the line is long and the meat is not go to sit there more than a minut if you cut it earli  it alreadi rest  it fine  good thing i didnt pay 50 for this buffet  oh waiti did
when i went befor they obvious had separ line  it took me to get them to separ it despit the serious angri patron  and no surpris thing went much smoother afterward  hey caesar palac  where my paycheck i manag your buffet for one night gari lovemanceo of caesars
3 no fresh fruit except for blackberri  they use to have great chocol cover strawberri  we were told they had been out sinc 2 day ago  thank god i didnt pay someth outrag like 50 for this buffet onli to have them run out of the most popular fruit in exist  oh waiti did pay 50  fk me  great ill get some rasberri  no  no rasberri either  wellw are in the desert  at least i didnt pay
4 dish at the tabl took a good long while to be clear  not the biggest deal in the world  but when your tabl is full it doe get a big messy
on the positives
1 for our group we paid 15 extra each to skip the line to get in  well worth it if your will to shell out the 15  look like at least an hour wait if not more  wish other place would have that option
2 the carv station meat were pretti good  sausag was spici and delici  bbq rib were tender and flavor  and the ribey was solid  the brisket howev was aw dri as a bone and realli overcooked
3 dessert were nice  i didnt eat much but the kona coffe mochi was veri veri good  one of my friend had a crepe and she thought it was one of the best shes had  so big thumb up for the dessert station  oh yeahand no wait  haha
4 temperatur was fine in the buffet  also no fire flood nuclear explos etc  hmmstruggl to think of thing to come up with in this section  no terrorists

in a nutshel if your alreadi at caesar and 50 isnt a ton of cash for you to spend then go for it  it perfect fine

if your make a special trip to a buffet then id recommend bellagio or wynn over this one  

just disappoint to see them pull out all the stop initi to generat that good public  then just bend you over and stick it in rough like this  it brutal  realli i should give this kind of crap the 1 star treatment  you know what  i will  drop to 1 star 

honest pay  dishonesti shouldnt  john h out

edit let me add one thing bleu chees dress constant get stuck in open of hard plastic bottl cant squeez it  thus it unus lolwe were excit to check out this new restaur we were left extrem underwhelm we sat in the bar to watch mnf it would have been nice to be abl to hear the game over the discord pop rock music at a mexican establish but i understand that you are not a sport bar it was monday night and with the except of a larg group  of blue hair celebr secretari day the place was empti  the bar area manag to fill up becaus the cardin were on tv and it seem as thought the high top and patio were busi as well 

our bartend amanda was veri polit and eager to up sell us their flavor tequila and specialti cocktail you can tell she was a littl wet behind the ear but she was do her best noth a littl train and experi cant fix the wait time to receiv a cocktail was excruci long though be a former bartend i understand the complex that new bar go though to develop new and uniqu cocktail  we order the pumpkin margarita i applaud the attempt but person it tast like puré babi food 

i was feel veri open mind and want to experi as much as i could that tqla had to offer so we order the salsa trio and chicken tortilla soup  

queso dip cold
habanero dip sweet with a swift kick afterward not bad
guacamol good but was gone after 2 bite i guess they feel if they place the guacamol on a bed of green shred lettuc it will look like there is more than deliv fail

chicken tortilla soup thick tomato soup with dri dark meat chicken chunk mayb it is just me but i prefer a more broth base ck tort soup and juici whitedark meat chicken bleh amanda offer to remov it off our bill but i insist on finish mine becaus i was hungri my gf push her to the side dnf 

meanwhil whilst experi our starter we manag without ani silverwar or napkin and at this point amanda be the onli bartend on manag to becom flood with specialti cocktail in the well thus not be abl to proper overse her patron at the bar needl to say our drink were empti our plate monkey dish empti bowl of chip 2 cup of bland tortilla soup saucer and wrinkl up black beverag napkin use in the place of the real one were all tatter on the edg of the bar eager anticip a bus boy to remov them 

onto the entrees

i order the carn asada steak  my girlfriend tri the habanero chicken platter they were deliv by tqla manag joe whom decid pull himself from enjoy the footbal game to expedit some food he crept up behind us and shuffl the entre platter in front of our face after we spread our dirti dish closer to the edg of the bar and polit stack them for our fictici busboygirl to remov them proper now in my histori with manag a decent manag would offer to remov the collect of dish but instead he decid to ask us if we need anyth els sinc the look on our face was disgust instead we opt to inform joe that we would enjoy our meal a littl better with silverwar and napkin  he acknowledg that was a novel concept and proceed to fetch us a pair joe wasnt six step away befor he was interrupt by a member of the waitstaff who inform him that what she need was more import than deliv two setup to some first time custom so they could enjoy their ever increas cold food  at this point my girlfriend temper got the best of her and she jump up and retriev her own silverwar off of a tabl in front of joe and eager waitress to salvag ani heat that might have been left in our entre 

we dig in  

carn asada was tender but lack the wow factor 

habanero chicken tast like a chicken breast smother in their warm fire roast salsa what happen to the habanero  where is the heat bland

i hope they get better but until then nando all the way never saw joe touch ani tabl never offer to help out a bartend who was swim lap in an olymp size pool occasion the wait staff would come behind the bar and help out  this is about the time that our appet chip soup and entre were all remov from the bartop fyi joe the hostess stand can hold itself up on it own you dont have to stand there and hold it up keep an eye on your staff and custom and offer help where they need it so peopl will be happi to come back and give you a second shotwatch the restaur imposs involv the mapl tree locat on spring mountain  i havent been to that locat sinc they chang owner  in the past i was a fan  i check the food network websit and notic they were open in a few more locat within exist bar  i then found out they are in my neck of the wood at lucki on jones

sorrithe place suuuuucccckkkss  fine the waitress said she couldnt close my bar tab after check with the bartend while she was get our drink and she didnt even ask my name to make a good attempt at pretend fine it was an hour and a half wait to get fri after order them fine the onion ring came out cold after wait one hour fine the hameggchees sandwich came out cold probabl sat at the window for a bit less than an hour fine the medrar burger came out medwel fine when i tri to leav to eat at local bistro they offer to comp my food if i left that i never receiv i went back as waitress said food was almost done my big mistak fine they compd desert i didnt want that came out undercook and had to  wait again for them to make a second attempt fine they drop and shatter a plate on one of the guest at our tabl at least we got 25 10 off the bill  cant wait to go back and flush 3 hour of my life down the drainawesom  ohalso the 1 pbr special fine u lie and not one of the five we order was 1 at least food was better than mcdonald but at least there u get food within an hour that is cook and they actual charg you the advertis price grant whether mcdonald is qualiti food well it a person choic  i choos to eat low qualiti food that will take 2 hour off my life rather than the 3 hour the grind  greyhawk took off my lifeso i love this place as a restaur but my opinion for their event has complet chang  just to clarifi this review is about their event not their restaur  the restaur day to day i love

i went to their new year eve parti  i was just not impress  first of all i did a reserv tabl  there was one server for three tabl  perfect  looov eric  i thought it was aw that the tabl next to us which was for four peopl realli had him serv like ten of their friend as well  this made our servic slow and he was overworked

th special bottl of champagn we receiv with the tabl was aw  as a wine and champagn lover i could not even drink it  it was disgust  

the music was bore  it was suppos to be great danc music with some 80s mix in  it was techno version of great song  everi time a person put in a request the djs girlfriend laugh about it and then they ignor it  it was aw  they were boring

when i read about the drink packag and call for further inform we were told that cocktail would includ rail option and a select premium number of item  my friend could not even get an amaretto and coke as part of her 65 ticket  kind of terribl  huh

i would not go there for event  they are price goug and it is just not worth it  oh and i spoke to three peopl about the music  suck  i am use veri nonproduct word  i get it  howev i am unabl to accur express myself over my disappointwow so i receiv a comment about by poor review  it explain that the champagn which i did not like sell for 100  it is funni that peopl believ becaus cost a great deal then it must be good  

i am clear offend that becaus i wrote in a review that i did not like the flavor a busi would remind me of it cost  pleas read with sarcasm if someth has a larg price tag then it must be good

not to mention none of the other issu mention were addressthe skinni lower than averag food 2 with shtti servic 0 and stay away stay far far away 1

okay  confess my hub and i total look for new place to tri out in town on eater vega one of the more anticip open this month was seafood shack which replac isla the mexican restaur in ti so we check out there websit which advertis the bogo entre promot sold i cant help it im asian and i cant help a good deal we were go the first tuesday of the grand opening

so we were get a tabl of 3 and i was the first to arriv i got seat around 615 and wait for the rest of the parti to arriv the bus girl come by fill the water and leav me alon fine 

as my parti trickl in i still had no idea who my server was by this time it around 650 befor she decid to saunter to our tabl and even acknowledg our presenc dead serious no ask if i want a drink no wonder if i want to order an appi or anyth yeah it was that bad

i was watch her like a hawk too  she liter disappear for a signific portion of the time unlik the other server around the restaur we liter saw her onc to take our order onc when our entre came she ask us how they were when we didnt even get a chanc to take a bite onc to take the dessert order which i had to flag her down  she mumbl under her breath in a minut and three time final to get our bill right

yeah you guy heard me three frking time to get the bill right she lost our bogo coupon neglect to take off a discount item gave us anoth person bill  i couldv taken off with anoth dude credit card  yeah that bad that ad anoth 30 minut of playtim at the seafood shacki was begin to think it should be renam seafood inn becaus at the rate we were go i thought we might have to sleep in our chair we were strand there for 2 hour god forbid if you actual had show or someth to catch

alreadi the servic or lack thereof would be enough to detract most peopl add to the fact that the food was subpar at best made the insult even more pronounced

i order a crab louie salad which is not difficult to do well as long as the ingredi are good the crab meat was sever below expect the crab was all macer and lack the sweet good qualiti meat ad to the fact that there were bit of the clear shell and outer shell piec mix in it was no es bueno throw in a few mealli tomato and some rather generic thousand island dress you have yourself a shti experi for 1695

we order 2 order of the fish and chip 1795 which were put appar on the same plate for reason unknown that was annoy becaus we were out with a friend and he obvious didnt want to eat off of our plate plus they onli provid half of the serv of chip but doubl the fri not that the fri were that great to begin with but come on the fish itself was greasi over batter and quit frank noth i would order again again the tartar sauc was some generic stuff you could get at ani groceri market

our pal order a clam chowder come in a bread bowl 895 and the linguin with clam 1695 but neither was anyth special accord to him

bi now i should have known better and quit while i was ahead howev i am a sucker for key lime pie and notic it was on the menu so think that there had to be some sort of redeem qualiti about this establish i order that to share with the hub while our pal got an appl pie a la mode 695 each

okay  let me get this straight  if your key lime pie is fking lime green you know it came out of a box and that there no freak way there ani sort of real lime in there let alon key lime the ohso soggi crust accompani by the rather solid bright green fill from a generic jello box was a full on textur assault and violat would not do this again i notic as well our friend appl pie  he left most of his pie crust on his plate and it look like a limp doughi mass

in general i do not have a lot of one star review and i realli hate write one unless it is realli realli bad on all front howev seafood shack  youv just 1ed yourself in my 1 star club 1 star reviewalway more secur as state on their shirt than actual staff and everi time ive been there which has been three time now everi one of them is bark order at you  form a line  get away from there  step back  with the mood light and custom decor the place seem to be tri to be swanki but even if their patron are a group of well dress mid30 year old theyr treat like cattl  realli who want to be serv drink by a riot squad  iron this place is bicycl theme and a local bicycl organ im involv in made it one of our stop on an organ ride  we took about fifti peopl there on bike after contact the manag and make arrang  the welcom was far from warm go around  you cant come in this way but as we were stage our rider to leav secur basic flip out on us act like they were readi to attack us scream at us and run around like angri ape becaus we couldnt queue all of rider to leav instant  one guy scream you arent even move  i told you to get off of our fenc  we had three rider that had squeez up next to the fenc to allow a crowd to go by in front and the other 30 odd that were readi were between the bush on the other side of the sidewalk to keep a clear path  bizarr bar secur was be hostil possess of the sidewalk that wasnt even what they are leas  our entir stop was 45 minut  there was no loiter  i have a friend who work here and who i consid to be good with peopl  if i were go to be bias it would be in favor of the place  all of the rider move as soon as the gaggl of peopl go down the sidewalk had pass  we were a group of grown adult but not even colleg student should be treat this way  im old enough to rememb when colleg student on mill avenu werent  long wong which requir physic intervent on occas never conduct itself like this befor it mill ave locat was bulldoz  even casey moor is pretti good at be more level head than their patron rather than tri to out dickhead them  give me your money and do what we say never sat well with me  there are way too mani other place that are actual good  better beer better beer select better price and run not like a prison that i can go to  if this get suggest for ride in the futur im veto itis there a zero star  

awesom a beer garden in downtown temp  sign me up  we get the menu and they have a decent select of good craft beer  awesom again

ther are 6 of us at the tabl this night saturday prior to this review and out of the 6 beer we order they are out of 4  ummm thud  oh let me rephras they were out of 5 caus when they brought one of the beer they said they had they realli didnt have it and chang his order to a kiltlift without ask  thud again

how doe a beer garden on a saturday night not have beer

onto the food  i love sausag and they have 4 of them on the menu i think two or three burger and a few salad  like 7 item total  so a brat and beer sound good  ohwer out of all sausag  thud

enough for me

7 menu item out of 4 beer garden out of at least 5 beer on tap could have been more who know tell me all i need to know

buh byeso im not tri to be funni when i say this but i wish i could have gave this place  zero star as far as the servic it wasnt that great but l ill give them the benefit of the doubt sinc it new and they have teen work up front it was my first time go there so i wish she told me i could have a flavor crust she told the two peopl after me thou and one of them got there pizza befor me not sure how that happen the pizza wasnt good at all to be honest but  500 larg 1 top pizza  you cant expect great but i do expect better then that now on to the philli cheesesteak hand down one of the worst cheesesteak ive had if not the worst i had the philli cheesesteak  with grill onion and chees sauc there was not one good thing about it the bread was nasti and hard there wasnt enough meat not sure if it was the chees or the meat but it was was veri salti it over price also 7 buck for a 8in if was just want a cheap pizza and dont care about tast ill say got for it but do not wast your money on the philli cheesesteakno star this place suck ball manag was rude with us and even took it upon himself to get in my face and cuss me out when his lil secur boy came up  long stori short they kick us out and didnt want to give me back my credit card until i was out of the bar def worst place on mill we have alreadi contact the corpor offic and they seem veri shock and offer for us to back with free drink and food but we declin dont wast your time herewe walk in on a tuesday night with our child the yelp info said it was kid friend it most certain was not we felt like we walk into an american apparel ad or an of montreal concert the place was pack with 1824 yearold drunk kid  the onli thing miss face paint and glow sticks

w had about a 15 min wait as we were be taken to our seat one of the waitress said who bring their babi to a restaur  to which i repli we do you ass  noth like a 22yearold punk with a holierthanthou attitud tri to ruin your night

th food was onli mediocr  we all agre that the taco were over greasi and all kind of had the same flavor  margarita are margarita  the empanada were not empanada i have ever had  they most resembl empanadashap eggrol  the best part of the meal was the chip and salsa they also charg extra for a refil of the salsa  ive alway thought it was lame to charg extra for a condiment

overal the food is not bad for a cheap taco tuesday  id keep the kiddo at home next time howev if i decid to bring her somewher it will be my deces and not up for review by some blond jerkoff waitressthank you veri much i give it one star becaus of the rude staff even just that one girl i dont have time for poor servic and bad attitud when i am pay for food that i can make better at homei will never patron this place again if it the last eateri on earth for a meal

bagel were ok but the attitud and recept from the owner is a minus 5 but that grade is not possibl but definit warrant for this owner and her establishment
i live in the estrella mountain and onli minut from this place so the wife and i frequent the store for week hope to patron local eateri and establish and one thing becam veri appar each and everi time we went thereth owner of the establish complet ignor us 

at first my wife and i thought mayb she was busi and didnt notic us but be such a small place you get to know everyon relat quick especi if they frequent your busi each and everi weekend  so we decid to say hello to her on one of our week saturday visit to and see if we read it incorrect and give her the benefit of the doubt but sure enough she never acknowledg us at all  not even a smile  but it get wors she walk pass us to greet anoth custom sit next to us that arriv after we were seat so i look at my wife and said it couldnt be becaus we are a interraci coupl huh  oh mayb we were invis or cover in manur it just had to be someth we ourselv could not see or notic ourselv  i realli didnt get it

so we went a few more time becaus this just couldnt be the case in the 21st centuri with a black presid  heck no  sure enough a few more saturday pass and not even a look in our direct  

i truli wish i could express how i feel about such peopl but i want this messag be read and the messag get out that this is our discoveri deal with this store never to spend anoth dime with them again  ripthis place is a dump when i walk in i notic that there was not a soul there yet all the tabl were dirti and the staff were sit at the dine tabl play on their laptop i order fri chicken and sweet potato and after wait 25 minut for my food to arriv i realiz they gave me collard green instead of sweet potato  i was also serv warm water becaus they ran out of ice so one of the employe went to get ice from the basha right around the corner and when he return he had to turn around and go right back becaus they also ran out of chang  needless to say i will not be return although the chicken was decent  i cant see this place last more than a coupl more monthmore like gigi frost  be a cupcak addict i had to tri the newest place in town sad they werent satisfi and i wont be return becaus i love cupcak not frosting

and the big kicker the price even with a buy 3 get 1 free coupon it was 12 3 per cupcak no thank 

as you probabl guess alreadi gigi overload their cupcak with frost there is more frost than cupcak liter  i end up scrape off 34 of the frost and stuck it in the freezer to frost my own treat  it thick heavi super sweet frost too 

of the 4 differ cupcak they all tast similar it was almost as though they had no origin then again mayb it was becaus of all the frost  

the cake itself was not dri nor was it moist but rather inbetween except for the strawberri one which had turn the cake into mush all around the strawberri eww

bottom line youll be pay top dollar for subpar cupcak mayb if they put as much effort into their cupcak as they do their packag and pretti pink deliveri van realli they might produc someth delishthe skinni came on a tuesday after have a 2 star meal experienc the bathroom olymp with the hub avoid 1 servic slight zealous server who want to know what we want right away3 valu there is no real posit valu when your head is in the toilet 0

okay it was my fault after be without sushi for 3 month i had a big crave so after look at the review onlin we settl at this place for lunch

w came for lunch to check thing out we were kind of leeri about make a huge commit to order the ayc option first of all we werent that hungri and we had a yelp event plan later in the even second the ayc menu is 21 for lunch consist larg of carb heavi roll and cook item which didnt realli appeal to us there is no sashimi on the ayc menu

our server was slight over attent to the point where she was check everi 23 minut of us get seat to put in our order

w end up order 2 lunch special i got the sushi combo which come with 4 piec of nigiri and a choic of spici tuna or california roll plus miso soup 1095the hub got the bento box with a spici tuna roll tempura salad and miso soup995

our food came out suspici fast  like definit not in a good way kind of fast like liter within 5 minut of get our soup 

the miso soup tast like bilg water the littl tofu swim in there look like the dehydr stuff you reconstitut from the small miso soup packets

mi sushi combo was suppos to be salmon red snapper tuna the fish tast veri ummmfishi in an unpleas way with a slight mushier textur than expect for sushi grade product the rice was not season well and was too firm the maki spici tuna roll incorpor way too much hot sauc so it suspici mask whatev flavor of fish that was in there more on that later

th hub experi with his spici tuna roll was the same as mine abov his tempura was over batter and thick the salad was a tad sweet but was otherwis okay

overal at that point we were think 2 star joint noth too offens but not great either definit not a repeat experi we figur hey it was onli like a 10 meal per person and didnt set us back too much

that is until we got home and the vomit began 

how i heav into my toilet betwixt me and my belov hubbi we were out for the count we were total bum that we had to miss out on a yelp event due to the the food poisoning

at the time of write this review the bile is still rise in my throat from the thought of what i ate for lunch deep down i think perhap the spici tuna is the culprit as it was the onli common denomin for my hub and i

so for that umiya youv join my 1clubsad i am break one of the cardin rule that i set for myself when i start yelp i espous onli say good thing about good place with the marketplac take care of the bad places

mi wife and i had errand to run and took the veri scenic drive north on scottsdal rd toward carefreecav creek we stop at the plummit in the hope that it would be a good new place it has been around for just a bit as evidenc by the notic of applic for alcohol beverag licens  anyhoo we look at the menu when we walk into the front door saw 7 empti tabl and ask the young girl aka greeter for a tabl we were told there would be a 15 minut wait i chuckl as i look at the empti tabl and mention to the greeter that it appear that there was some avail i wasnt rude i just ask  what i heard was the sound ofcricket  nothingjustth wait will be 15 minut  the menu appear to be good basic foodwhich is just peachi howev if the level of custom servic in the back end is the same as the face of the restaur the greeter in the front end i doubt that i will be yelp the food  i realli hope that this was just a glitchbut i like wont return becaus the level of competit is high and custom servic is as high on my wish list as most anyth els  if you go i hope that your experi is better than oursand that you can be seat in a room with ampl empti tabl  dr bsuper disappoint in javier after last night and not sure that we would ever return to the restaur after the way guillermo the manag handl our situat and treat us while we were there  
we were a group of 4 all local dine befor a show  two of us got there earli and order drink from the bar  the bartend cara was veri accommod realli nice and made us martini that were not on the menu  she took an idea of the flavor that we were look for and she made a perfect martini  the other two in our parti arriv we close out our tab with cara 14 per drink and we were seat  
lui was our waiter dure dinner and did a fantast job  we order food and continu to order the same martini at dinner we told lui to go to cara sinc she had made the origin martini  dinner was good and then we receiv the bill  the martini were now 17 instead of the 14 that we were charg at the bar  i question lui and he said that we were charg the wrong price at the bar and that 17 was the new and correct price  i explain that it wasnt right to charg 14 at the bar and then 17 at dinner   we thought that they were 14 and happili paid that at the bar and continu to order becaus we thought that they were 14   he offer to get the manag guillermo  guillermo came over and we explain the situat that we had a coupl martini at the bar for 14 and then at dinner they were 17  guillermo said that 17 was the right and a fair price for the martini and that he would not chang it  i explain that it was not our fault if they charg us the wrong price at the bar but sinc we had alreadi start drink the martini at one price didnt he think it would be fair that night to let us have the other two that we order at the same price  he said no  we explain that we were local frequent the restaur and were disappoint in the way that he was handl the situat sinc we were now argu over 6 and he said that he would not adjust the price for the martini that was their price and it was a fair price for the martini  he then went on to tell us that he would be write up the bartend who made us the drink and she would be disciplin  what manag doe that  whi in the world would he tell us about his disciplinari action toward his employe  i made sure to tell them that even though cara may have made a mistak on the price she was certain a veri good bartend and she should not be written up  we then told him that we would never return to that restaur and he said that was fine and walk away  i was astonish that a manag at a restaur of that calib would talk to us that way give us his disciplinari action detail and not adjust the price of their martini to a price that we had alreadi been pay and argu with us over 6  our argument was base sole on principlewhen you charg a custom one price for someth and then less than one hour later charg them more for the same item that is wrong and he could not and would not see that or chang it  what if the differ had been more than 6  what if it had been food  i just cant see how you can run a restaur that way and we were certain not look for freebi or handoutsw were just look for a manag to do what was right  
we ask our waiter lui for ani other manag name so that we could make a complaint later and he gave us a coupl of other name and we paid our bill and were about to leav  
as we were about to leav the general manag mois came over and ask what the problem was  we explain again and he understood and offer us a drink at the bar sinc we had alreadi paid our bill  while we were explain the situat to mois the peopl dine next to us were frustrat too and spoke upso at that point i think javier had two tabl of four peopl that were not happi at all  we had to be at the show in 15 minut and could not accept his offer for a drink so he gave us his card and said to call him befor dine there again   the problem is that i am not sure that i want to dine there again and i am not sure what he would even do to make this a better experi   i realli have a bad tast in my mouth from the manag guillermo and how he handl their custom   i have never seen a manag handl a situat like that befor and was super disappoint and we have all been in the industri in the past as well  in my opinion i think guillermo need some addit train on custom servic befor they allow him to deal with peopl in the futurgave them a tri 102212 best of luck to a beginn stab at a restaur i doubt they will be around long

in detail
when we enter we notic the place had been complet revamp   pictur big hip pizza joint smell clean and look clean   brick wall stamp metal ceil chalkboard décor great light fun music nice furnitur etc  it look like a trendi sport restaur  great for after work with friend and also for the famili   

it wasnt busi at all tonight  we sat at the bar and this is when everyth went down hill  as we look around we notic most of the staff were chat with friend or each other  we wait about 5 minut befor someon greet us  when we were final greet there was no hi  welcom to meatbal spotw are known for  instead it was a simpl what would you like to drink  after we order our drink we borrow a menu from the peopl next to us  when we got our drink we order the four meatbal assum that would be their specialti  that when we were told that the four meatbal item print on the menu would onli come with three   huh   her respons was we are new and just open   whi not reprint the menus  so we sat at the bar wait for the food to arriv and analyz   what was go to make this restaur surviv  so far we determin it would not be the servic  when our food came didnt take long we still had not receiv our set up fork napkin share plate etc so we ask for them  it took three attempt for them to provid me a clean plate  we had order  beef meatbal with spici sauc and ad provolon on top and a side of mac  chees  the meatbal were ok but extrem greasi  the mac  chees was kind of bland   as we ate our food we had mani staff member stand in front of us behind the bar with their back to us  rude  to our surpris one was even the manag tall  bald head guy  mind you there were mayb 15 peopl seat at a 30 seat bar   three of the 15 peopl at the bar were actual staff who had appar just gotten off work and still had their solid black shirt on   when we were done a differ bartend ask us how our food was   she could tell someth was wrong and she ask me to be honest so i was  i mention the greasi of the meatbal and didnt get a chanc to mention the mac  chees befor she apolog and said she would take them off the bill   still the manag never came over to introduc himself    we hope to hear good feedback about this place in the futur befor we returnomg i am speechless what came out of the manag mouth  my boyfriend and i were think of tri out this place but i heard a custom ask about the four meatbal advertis vs peopl onli get three meatbal question and the manag repli was i just told you 2 second ago is three and not four  horribl attitud and servic in my opinion from manag for that we walk away  my money is better spend somewher els if not for food is for the great servic  the rate for that is a big fat zeroive had better servic at the rudest mcdonald i went there with the hope intent of a milkshak and ice cream sandwich what happen instead was a display of the worst custom servic i have ever had when i walk in i was almost plow into by the hostess with a breathi tabl for 2 no hello no welcom we then approach the bar area where we went to order two milkshak we were then told that they didnt have enough glass to serv milkshak ok fine ill give you that they just open but if they didnt have everyth then they shouldnt have open 

mi fiance and i then went to yogurtland and on our return to sit on the bench by doubl helix i see someon sit at the front of the restaur with a suspici look drink i approach the woman and ask if that was a milkshak and she repli yes i then becom quit offend and as i walk in and ask for a manag he overheard my question and then proceed to offer to make us milkshak mind you he is stand in front of the regist readi to ring up my order while we are hold two full yogurtland cup 

instead of apolog and offer for us to come back we were met with the offer of pay near 12 for two addit desert that would have been serv with a side of disdain and well you caught us here a shake 

ive gotten bad servic befor but for the life of me i cant imag a place not want to take my 12 

if you are think about go to this place pleas take your money and rip it up and flush it down the toilet at least the experi will be more satisfi than spend even 10 minut in this custom servic hellthought wed tri this place out becaus of the reput of chef carla pelligrino and we were veri dissapointed

th hostess sat us at 515pm which was befor the major saturday night rush  upon sit us at the tabl she notic onli one set of silverwar in which she said ill go get you a second set  that would have been fine but she never brought us a second set  our server arriv short after to take our drink order  michelob ultra and a water pleas   the menu look great  hope the food is as great as it sounds

th waiter came back and took our order  not friend at all  while take our order he was peroccupi with someonesometh els in the restaur and did not make eye contact with us onc   my wife order the chop salad which list a bunch of fresh veggi in the mix  the waiter warn us that the salad did not actual come with ani salad  no green salad just top  ok that sound like an interest concept but that was fine as the toppingsveggi on a salad are alway great  i order three turkey meatbal and a peanut butter milkshake

stil no silverware

a few passesbi by the waiter while servic other tabl and he final stop briefli to tell us they were out of michelob ultra  ok  bring anoth beer please

anoth quick stop by i forgot what type of milkshak you order  peanut butter  thanks

food was deliv by a server  look good to me  we ask the server to bring us a second set of silverwar  ok ill be right back

th salad was not a salad  sure the waiter told us there was no green salad in the salad but this is ridicul  a bowl full of crispi thing and a few i mean few green salad item a few onion a few avacado a few tomato  ugh  this is a bowl of crispi stuff with a littl dressing

no silverwar  anoth waiter walk by and i ask him for a set  he decid to pick it up from anoth preset tabl and give to us becaus he say were out of silverwar they are wash in the back of hous right now  use these  ok  admir 

the turkey meatbal were good but not spectacular  id eat them again and again but id rather make them at home myself  noth  special that call for a trip back  the side of steam broccoli that i order was ok but too much garlic for most people

m is done  the waiter apolog for the salad and offer to take if off of our bill  ok  that was nice  the waiter joke about our visit and ask if we need anyth els befor we leav would you like some more crispi salad  ok he has a sens of humor

but unfortun we wont be come back to this place  be forewarn the servic and restaur prepar was horribl the food  bwow this place suck  the servic was bad the meatbal were bland and dri and other than the bread the food was just terribl  let me start off with say that the best meatbal ive had is from lavo  it moist juici and has this sauc that is just to die for  after wait for 20 minut without either a drink order or anyth we final had someon come up to us and tell us that our server would be with us in a moment  five minut later the server arriv to take our order  i joke around with the server to ask if his meatbal were just as good but he said that he didnt know  

anyway i order the hidden menu item spaghetti and meatbal with the spici meat sauc and my buddi had the meatbal parm sandwich  when my meal arriv i was disappoint with the portion size  first it pastaso what kind of restaur give a small portion of it  second after i cut into the meatbal i could see how dri it was  when i ask the server if it was suppos to be like that he said yes the meat is veri lean  he also admit that the first time he ate one he was also surpris how dri it was  it should go without say that a dri meatbal is flavorless and has a bad mouth textur  combin that with the insipid sauc it was just a huge disappoint meal  

anyway if you want a place with bad servic flavorless food and an overal disappoint experi meatbal spot is the place for you  also the menu has all these add on that you need for each thing you order so the price point isnt all that competit  hope this place improv but ill never know sinc im never go back and will tell all my friend how lousi this place isi was realli excit becaus this look like a realli cute place but the servic was aw i came in and stood by the hostess stand wait for my parti no one greet me or came to the front the manag and the bartend also ignor me even though i was 3 feet from them when the hostess final came it was to tell me she would be with me in 10 mns like i was bother her then we sat at our tabl for 15 mns befor anyon came over food was good horribl servicthis place doesnt realli deserv 1 star but i need to balanc out the inflat score other peopl are give it has been so incred hype up that peopl who cant tell the differ between great food and averag food will be compel to give it 5 star base on ambienc and reput alon  
ye the atmospher was farmchic but that also bring an air of snobbi when your close to summerlin that justifi them serv up extrem overpr dish that are averag at best
dont get me wrongim will to spend the money for qualiti food ive paid 1800 for a sushi meal for two befor that i felt was worth everi dollar but the whole experi here left a sour tast in my mouthwe come here even though jenni pho is closer for all our hangov need but this past sunday visit just might be our last walk into the restaur and was not even greet for over 5 minut even though there were worker here and there just look at us my man final walk up to a server and ask if we could sit in one of the empti booth we sit take anoth 10 minut just to get water and menus after a few more minut pass my boyfriend tri to get one of the server attent but we are told to hold on at this point we are so irrit we walk out he get a cheeeeeburg from next door and i got my pho from jenni pho ughhhhh the restaur is small and was not even that busi   

anni you need to step up your game becaus the servic here get a big fat fhi yall

i want to first say i will be tri and support the food truck and go to more in the future

thi one star is about the organ and the polic that basic creat a fiasco at the open on sunday

did you all get a chanc to tri out the food truck that weekend  guess what after a less than stellar day on saturday  we decid to tri out the place again  yep i felt sinc we gave it a 25 star round to 2 we would tri it again becaus we may have been a bit judgment or just mental


1  orang wrist band  decid to wear these for anoth 24 hour nice orang and wear it on a warm day make for mani convers  guess what i was sell it tell all to come to the silverton all about the truck and the varieti of food and etc 

2  confirm  oh yeah ask the organ and secur how we can reenter on sunday and they said come in through the exit line and bypass the regular line for the onlin and the cash pay attend  the long line

3  sunday  got there at 1130 the regular line was alreadi about 120 yard long and get longer church everyon  come on it is sunday

4 to band or not to band so we stood in the line with the other orang wrist band peep which was about 100 peopl compar to the mani hundr in the pay line we were near the entranc and the other were line  on the side  we had a few peep in the front of the regular line who must have been there for hour  i think the first 20 yard of peopl in the pay line were there for hours

5  the copper  the sun burn white castl devote in the front of the line were complain about all us return wrist band folk  we did not respond but just all explain what the organ and secur were tell us from the day befor just follow the instruct and the rule and the benefit of buy the wristband the cop came up and advis us in the exit line to dispers  we advis them of the organ rule and so the cop said okay sorri we just got here  then after minut they spoke to the organ and the organ also made comment to the crowd  now we were realli set the all the wrist band peep line up a bit tighter and the other line were not happy

6  the decis   the cop did not like the 12 peopl in front of the regular line who were sun burn and vocal  mean that these folk were complain that they were there for hour and it was not fair and all that  the copper made a decis to allow 10 of the wrist band folk to enter the exit line as normal and the rest of us had to go to the back of the line  i ask the cop whi make that decis to satisfi 12 peopl out of 100 of peopl who were follow the rule he said i am make a command decis  not sure  but when doe a respect decis includ make one to suit 12 peopl who are not follow the rule against 100 who follow the rule  he said sorri just made a decis go to the back of the other line  well that was the law  we pay for that  veri interesting

7  the organ  they retreat back to their cashier line they did not stick up for their word we look at them and all we saw were their back as they were walk away to count their cash  we head to our car in the park lot  all the park attend and secur were tell the incom crowd with wristband to go to the exit line  where the cop were direct them against all logic and rule to the back of the other line funny


non of this matter  i apolog for rant and a 1 star  it is just that organ and support are key to ani event and this was not accept 

the food is great the truck are fantast  i give the food the vendor a 5 star and will alway support them  

the organ and the attend  shame on you for not support all of us that support you shame on us for pay for and accept your rule and follow them

th cop i am afraid to comment on your abil other than fact that i have been to mani communist countri for work and all i can say is hmmmmm

gk say continu to support the food truck  this is capit in action you get a great product for what you pay for  5 star for them  yeahnasti my wife was addict to this place when it first open but they are open locat around town so fast that consist is a major issu the burger here tast frozen and cook too long when i place an order onlin i still end up wait 15 plus minut for my food after arriv serious mcds tast better my last order was wrong and yet again burnt i will say that the eat area is alway clean but the food and servic should be more on parthis was the worst dine experi i have ever had ever i am a giant fan of fox restaur concept and the first time i went to the yard  i was so excit conceptu the design is stellar howev i will not be return i call to set a reserv of 12 for my birthday this past saturday i was told they did not take reserv turn out they do i have had sever friend that have been told they do not take reserv and anoth set of friend that say that they have actual made reserv i found out upon my arriv they do inde take reserv they need to get their stori straight

anyway we show up at 315pm and put our name on a list for 12 we were told 1 hour to 15 hour wait no problem we went to the bar while at the bar the staff was liter fumbl over one anoth and it was not even that busi the entir bar peopl we did not even know were all complain about the time it took to order one drink due to the lack of attent from the bar staff 

at 430 i go to check in with the hostess they had sat a differ group at our tabl and said they would tri to find us a new tabl this was a result of their miscommun as a staff they were not abl to clear a tabl for us right away to rectifi their own mistak so they sat us in a loung area about 10 minut later until they could find us a tabl howev we would have to vacat the loung area by 6pm becaus wait for it  someon had a reserv for the loung area at 6 my onli prayer was that we certain wouldnt still be wait for a tabl at 6pm near 3 hour later 

the waitress for our loung area was so incred rude that i cannot put it into word i have never had that poor of an attitud from a staff member at ani restaur especi fox after the biggest let down of give our tabl away i was hope perhap they would offer to buy us a pitcher of beer or some appet we receiv one bowl of chip and one fondu dishfor the entir group we had to wait over 15 minut for one round of drink that we were charg full price for it was not until the time was near 530pm that the manag seem to get proactiv about find us a tabl fast forward to 545pm 25 hour after arriv and there is no tabl that even seem to be in sight for us to be seat at and we are still receiv horrend servic we decid to go down the street to zipp where they could seat us immedi can you imagin how hungri we are arriv at 315pm readi to eat

th manag notic we were leav and came over to tri and get us to stay i had been so incred respect nice and understand throughout the entir process until i hit my break point as we were leav i explain that peopl liter spent money to fli in for this birthday becaus it was a veri special birthday and we chose the yard for a reason howev the experi at the yard ruin my birthday upon unload on the manag they took care of one of my 7 drink woohoo and he sent me on my way with a free browni 

it truli seem as if they onli hire for look at this restaur becaus everyon that we encount may have been good look but seem had never work in the restauranthospitalityservic industri i have never been so disappoint in a dine experi the manag ask for my email address so that they could invit us back and give us a special experi it took him four day to send that follow up email i receiv it this morningprompt this review ani profession would have sent a sincer apolog within 24 hour which is typic busi practic 

is there a chanc that my group was the except to the rule possibl howev i am not will to return and find out in fact i will not be return to ani fox concept for quit a while disappoint doe not begin to describ my experi at the yard possibl patron bewarthis place had me confus from the get go first off no park except for valet which even though is free you still alway tip so it not free is this phoenix az or los angel ca the neighbor around this place must be piss if you dont use valet you have to park in front of their hous the valet lot is tini so they run out of room veri quickly

second is this a nice restaur a sport bar or a playground for children i was greet with a line of about 20 peopl befor we could even speak to a hostess so we just walk into the barplayground area on our own after wander around look for a seat a littl tabl open up and we took it uncomfort littl metal stool and a ricketi wood top was what we had to deal with there was no wait staff come around to ani of these tabl so we got a beer from the corner beer bucket girl 525 for a can of fat tire a can not veri impress i suppos i could have walk up to the bar area but it was stack 2 deep with peopl wait to get their drink as well so i decid to go for the easi way out

th shuffleboard game was be use by some 6 year old kid who were play with the sand and not the puck but the board itself look like a cheap one and was not veri long we decid to pass up that game and hope to play ping pong sinc there were two tabl empti when we went up front to get the paddl the hostess said i guess the peopl who have those paddl are eat or someth and we were not allow to play the tabl sat empti until we left i notic on the two tabl that were go that there were mani instanc where peopl walk down the path were almost hit by the pong player ping pong doesnt seem like a good fit for the small space they put it in bean bag perhap shuffleboard sure ping pong no

i cant comment on the food becaus we never had a chanc to order ani and the wait for get insid the restaur was over an hour i am sure the food is descent sinc it is a fox establish but the price i saw seem a bit steep 

again i am not sure what this place is all about but it definit didnt feel right to me i dont want to be hang out with my friend drink adult beverag and dodg 5 year old kid who are scream and run around with no supervis is this place meant for famili with small kid is it mean for colleg peopl is it made for jock girl that like to get all dress up older folk local i saw all of these peopl there and everyon look out of place to me 

it will be interest to see how it work dure the summer time i didnt see ani mister in that outdoor game area good luck yard i doubt i will make it back thoughmy wife and i love thai food  we have eaten at mani of the thai restaur in the phoenix area  we were so happi to see a thai restaur open in surpris  we eager await the day we could tri it out and had the greatest of expect for it as we had peer in the window befor it open and thought that the place look nice

wel it look nice but we have had anyth but a good experi eat here  we have now been to this restaur twice hope that the first bad experi was just grand open pain  unfortun it is not

w went the end of the second week after it open  the food was decent but the servic was terribl  veri slow and veri disorgan  it seem to take forev befor anyon came to our tabl after we sat down  eventu we order our drink an appet and our main cours  our main cours were eventu brought to the tabl onli to have the appet follow the serv of our main cours  when we point this out they took our main cours away and left the appet  i told them i did not want my food brought back to the tabl cold but when it was brought back after we finish the appet it was anyth but hot  it took an act of congress to get a drink refil  

okay we thought  it is just grand open problem  well tri it again sometim in the future

that futur was today  plenti of time for them to iron out their problem  my wife and i went to the restaur with a friend  we were not greet when we came in the restaur and a custom look up at us and told us to just sit where we want  so now the custom are give other custom advis as to where to sit  how love  never mind we found a tabl and sat down  we were given menus right away and a man took our drink order  we then sat there for a good 15 minut wait for someon to take our food order  we spot a waitress who sat a coupl down immedi took their drink order then immedi took their appet order and i final stop her when she brought out the other tabl appet  it was obvious from the way she talk with this other coupl that they were regular  i guess be not a regular we didnt seem to matter  okay so we gave her our order  

mi wife and i order the same dish her complet mild and mine with medium heat  our friend place his order  after about 10 minut the waitress brought out my friend order and took my drink away ask what i would like in my refil  my friend began eat and i anticip our order would be out within second  after he had finish about a quarter of his meal i saw our waitress with two dish sit up on the counter and she was prepar take out order  we didnt have our food and i never got my drink  after a bit i was begin to get veri annoy and i final got up and ask what was go on  turn out that the food that was sit on the counter for a long while were our order  she brought them over then went and got me my drink  this was a bit much  our food was anyth was hotin fact it was room temp but i was sure not go to send it back  i was alreadi upset  a man came over and told me that he would frank one of our meal  i could care less about thati just want my food and decent servic  now here come the cherri on the top  my wife meal was as spici as mine  they obvious didnt prepar her mild just made them both up in the same wok and what they make is what you get  to top it off the veri last bite of chicken i put in my mouth i spit out as it was almost raw  i want to throw up

avoid this restaur  you have been warn  i wouldnt go back if the food was free  

grant i never write to yelp about place i like but i hard have ever written to complain either  for me to do this write up you know it is badhigh unrecommend business

i will not return to this busi even with manageri action plan or intervent 

i am disappoint with this compani rate 055 star for bad busi but a clean storeif yelp had an evil twin equival of the rotd review of the day this would win hand down to the reader i am not take respons for your well be if you still choos to eat here especi after read this review

let start from the begin i bring my wife and two boy i order 4 pastor taco for me and my oldest a chees quesadilla for my youngest and an order of asada fri for all of us to share

so the food come out it all look good but look can be deceiv you know when peopl say dont judg a good book by it cover well this cover look good but onc you read the first page it will make you want to rip it in half and burn it

for starter the pastor was dri like it has been on the spit for day that realli funni becaus there was oil liter pour out of the tortilla when i pick it up my guess is that they dip it in hot oil befor throw it in the tortilla i should of took pictur of the plate it was on becaus it was liter transpar from all the grease

th quesadilla should of been call a greasadilla my youngest onli took a coupl bite befor he had to stop becaus of greas run down his chin and fore arm the tortilla itself was alreadi soggi 

as for the asada fri i was hope that would be the save grace to this horribl experi so far i was wrong boy was i wrong i took a pictur of it and post it on here it look decent but when we start eat it we notic they had use nacho chees instead of shred cheddar for nacho that might be ok but for fri that a major no no the meat was also greasi like they dip it in oil to bring it to life the onli decent thing about it was the sour cream and guacamole

w ate or should i say tri to eat at least half of our food but it seem like with everi bite our stomach were scream bloodi murder but ala we had to dump it in the trash 

so in close memo to pepe can you pleas cut down on the greas and at least make the taco just a tad bit bigger onc you do that then mayb i will give you guy anoth trimy grandma and i stumbl in here for lunch while run errand and it was our first time

w were definit turn off a bit by the menu as it made us feel like we were at cheesecak factori where there were numer type of cuisin and no direct if it is suppos to be asian fusion it should be innov and have onli chines inspir food it seem strang to have so mani differ type of food togeth such as guacamol and lettuc wrap orang chicken and flatbread and etc i know it an ideal set to go when you go with a big group and everyon is picki about certain thing but there is alway someth on the menu for those picki eater so do not worri about what they would order but refocus your menu like the review mention on the other yelp

a i know we critiqu have weird combin on the menu we decid to tri the margarita flatbread and the evil jungl princess rice dish with shrimp while we are wait for our food our waiter bring us both hot tea and i did not order a hot tea but he disappear for awhil so i couldnt tell him that i onli want ice water i decid to have hot tea becaus we did not have our water yet final he came back and we told him about the water and he took our food order the funni thing is we ask him for his opinion and like the one review said they do not know the menu veri well to explain or even offer some favorit 

the reason behind this bad review is becaus of the actual food we thought we would get the flatbread first but it came with the rice dish as well we did not make a big deal and decid to eat both at the same time the flatbread had so much balsam vinegar that it was hard to tast the tomato and the chees it was ined the shrimp in the evil jungl rice dish was disgust it tast like imit crab but with shrimp it did not tast like shrimp at all my grandma and i liter lost our appetit the rice itself had potenti but did not have much veget like the menu describ there were onli four piec of shrimp but we each did not finish our first shrimp becaus it was tasteless and not shrimp

i realli hope they listen to all of our review and chang it and actual get their food fresh and not frozen seafood or whatev that shrimp wasthis place was horrend in everi way possibl  i like to keep an open mind go to new place frequent buy groupon to place i havent gone to yet to tri them out and explor eateri wherev i may be  this was so bad i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy

let me start to say that the place was not too busi arriv at 615pm  there was nobodi wait in line as there were a number of empti tabl  it appear there were veri few employe there  dure our visit it appear there was onli 1 person to take order and ring up ticket 1 person to get drink and clean tabl and 1 person in the kitchen there may have been more in the kitchen but onli saw one person from the kitchen carri out food as sinc the other half was so understaf she was run out order here and there becaus nobodi was pick them up  this spell disast already

mi guest and i order a brisket meal and a pull pork meal  it took near 45 minut to get our order onli after ask what was take so long  the onli good aspect is that for the price of the meal the pull pork meal had plenti of meat for the price the brisket meal on the other hand was the sever opposit veri littl meat for the higher price paid  except for the bake bean on one meal side the rest of the food was not hot  the brisket was slight warm but the pull pork and the famous sweet potato casserol side dish both meal got were all cold  we didnt want to send anyth back as it alreadi took 45 minut to get our food to begin with

everybodi food was take forev  we overheard other patron complain  also the servic staff is sever cold and rude  they never ever came over to see if the food was ok  just final went to get it when we ask what was take so long drop it off then we had to wave her down again just to get our check  refil of drink ask if everyth was ok with the order  haha not go to happen at this place  the server even had the gall to tell a patron seat behind me to come back again without a groupon next time  how rude they were visibl upset

th regular sauc is ok noth to write home to mom about and if you like spici food the hot sauc is pretti hot even my asian friend who love hot food comment it was a littl too hot for a bbq place

i will not return and if it keep up the tone it had tonight i would expect this dive to close soonwas not impress at all i wouldnt call this a gourmet burger and they are expens didnt like the way the meat tast too salti and the french fri were ok we order the rosemaryol oil and garlic fri my husband love burger but we will not go back   this was the second time we had tri them

i will say the staff was great too bad their burger are not great 

we would rather go to in in out or five guy 
 
they have realli loud music play also which is not veri pleasant my husband and i could bare hear each other talk i cannot believ the follow messag that i receiv from the owner of this place  here is the yelp messag word for word

heard you were in my pizzeria
w polit ask you not to ask for xtra wet ingredi as this will make the pizza soggi becaus it is a true wet dough pizza
w train in napl itali not california like the abov mentioned
w like to tell our custom to watch youtub video of da michel pizzeria
then they know what we are do and thank god for the thousand of custom we have each week that appreci the fresh and qualiti that we bring at such a low low price
thank for tri us but you seem to like the american version better

first of all it obvious that mr classi lack basic read comprehens becaus most of his messag doesnt even fit with my review  for exampl he polit lol polit sure ask me not to ask for extra wet ingredi notwithstand the fact that all my pizza had was sauc and chees  notic he doesnt say anyth about my remark regard disgust mozzarella and too much oil  im sure that authent napoli style riiiiight  

i stand by my review which wasnt meanspirit in the least and it a shame that this busi owner lack the class and decenc to actual take feedback from custom and do someth construct  instead he decid to send a privat messag act like i am the one with an issu  serious  someon has his undi in a bunch and seem upset with the fact that settebello is far superior  here a hint if you want your busi to thrive then you might actual focus on make peopl experi more posit rather than just insult them  geezchef marcne to be at the centenni location10 custom walk out my pizza was black on the bottom and burn on top you had one pizza guy and 2 other ladi work the counter   i return my pizza  they remad it for me but it was as good as i had it 4 month ago veri disappoint get some more helpsome of the most delect sweet treat i have had in las vega have come from pinkbox but the experi i had there recent pretti much negat all of that i order a dozen and got a mix of classic and fanci schmanci gourmet to be specific
3 glazed
3 croissant style w cinnamon and sugar
1 smores
2 mapl bacon
2fat elvis
1 appl pie
they were swamp i got my box of goodi and left now when i got them the glaze were still warm and i thought that was a good thing i was so wrong when i got to the offic and everyon dug in we realiz the glaze and the cronut were raw not kinda doughi straight up not cook i was surpris and kinda gross out so i call the person i spoke to did not give there name but identifi themselv as the manag he told me that i was wrong was rude dismiss and with a rude littl quip about not have time for thishung up i follow up with an email and never heard back it left a realli bad tast in my mouth so here it is in a nutshell
if you patron them do so cautious if they screw up they will yell at youther are ton of establish that do care they appar do notover ambiti cafeteria style food  with a big name to back it

w were raw had the textur of someth frozen no juici and aw asian inspir sauc 

pork belli bun was just as bad dri bun came with the driest piec of pork belli i ever had

mi burger which is appar grill over applewood had no tast of wood smoke or juici the bun was stale and dry

whi would gordon ramsay put his name behind such a place clear he hasnt tri the food

i lay here after a weekend in vega on the verg of a cold from parti all night at marque i could definit have use my last meal in vega to get some sort of vitamin or just a littl bit of emot uplift from the food instead i left vega cold empti deject and miserable

damn you vega and damn you gordon ramsayfood was great after we final receiv it we order pork bao bun to start then order fri  a burger to split and share

w were serv all three item at the same time almost one hour after place our order  we told the server we were in a hurri when we sat down  instead her servic was less than stellar though the food was good even though we had to rush  gulf it down as to not be late for our show appointment

aft we were present with the check we sign and complet the transact  i then order two togo shake it took 30 minut to receiv not onli did it take 30 minut from the time we place the order the server charg me 6900 for two shake she then present me with a new check for 1900 say she credit my credit card for the 6900  after review my bank account she charg me for both 6900 and for the 1900  there was no credit issu whatsoever

our entir dine time took one hour and 30 minutes

i give the cuisin 9

for the serviceappal   even a 1 is way too generousworst servic ever i request a quesadilla when i ask the server what was in the quesadilla she explain how it had beef in it i ask if i could get it without meat i was told no that they would not i said then ill have to cancel my order she roll her eye and storm off my friend and i just cancel the whole order and walk out mani more option at the airportthe one star in my review is for the quick smile and greet we receiv immedi upon enter after say hello the hostess ask if we had a reserv nope i repli just want to stop in she then ask if we would prefer to sit at a tabl or the bar a tabl would be great i said well respond the hostess were veri busi tonight which i total got i mean the bar and the dine room were complet empti so we do ask that you be respect of that excus me im sorri i dont understand i ask look for clarif oh never mind would you prefer a tabl or a booth umm how about neither sorri ladi not so confid the food at this establish will wash away that bad tast you just put in my mouth mayb i was just realli hungri and easili irrit but that enough to put me off this place for a good long while in the meantim guess ill just hop over to the reliabl chinatown when im in the mood for asian goodnot impress thus far and i didnt even get to tri their food

it the 21st centuryget with the program peopleupd your websit open tabl and yelp  im pretti sure it not that difficult to chang the time from 10 am to 1130am  we got there a littl bit earli but sinc we saw that they open at 10 am we figur it would be ok to be earli for our 11 am reserv we end up walk around until 11 becaus it didnt look open at 1050 am  we were excit when we heard the clock chime 11 time so we hurri walk over to poppi den some other ladi was talk to what look like the manag but long stori short the stori the manag gave me was that they are go through chang and have not had a chanc to updat anyth in ani case i couldnt wait anoth 30 minutesi was starv we never get to go out without the babi and this was our chanc so we left disappoint and me a bit angri 

will i give poppi den anoth chanc perhap but their food better be amaz when i go my husband told me there noth like a hungri woman scorn aint that the truthnever again will i come here as a piec of wood end up in my roll taco im usual a forgiv person when it come to stuff like this but one of my front teeth is fake and probabl could have bust bite down on a piec of wood no thank robbi ill just have to find somewher els for my late night postwork food need ewwe had come here onc befor and had a good experi  this past saturday night we were in the area and pho sound good  sinc we like this place befor we were look forward to come back
walk in the door we wait a few minut without be acknowledg this was as about three staff member walk through the room and just ignor us i was just about to leav when the girl in the seahawk jersey acknowledg us from across the room with a what is it now look on her face  practic roll her eye she said two and sat us without say anoth word no ill be right back or anyth at all no glass of water  noth we wait anoth few minut with no servic and just walk out there are lot of other pho option around that are more than will to serv their custom so we went elsewheri am most conflict i have met sheridan su and he is a great guy but the restaur chris and joseph went to recent was nowher close to the restaur i ate at hey it great to have friend write puff review but in the long term it truli doe sheridan a disservice

first the good the pot sticker yes they were good and tasti but onc the order was place they took 30 minut to come out  and there were onli a hand of peopl in the restaur  plus i saw sheridan and anoth cook in the kitchen  doe this neighborhood realli support five small pot sticker sell for seven bucks
 
this is my major beef with fat choy there is a total disconnect with the menu and the neighborhood exampl they open for breakfast at 8amthi is a work class areath work class is at work at 8amalso pancak and egg sell for eight bucksagain mayb that work but not here how about a breakfast special to draw peopl inthi is not robuchons

back to the meal i order  beer and i believ they brought me someth close to a 40ozi laughedlargest bottl beer i have ever had with dinnerwho came up with that

pork belli blti was excit to tri this unfortun the pork belli was more like bacon bitsther were hard ani therei ask for extra sriracha mayo and there was not enough to even tasteand the bread was total soak in grill greaseabsolut brutal execution

pleas understand i want noth but success for sheridan but i have never walk out of a restaur feel the owner had such a disconnect with concept and present as what sheridan has done with fat choy an intervent is need without which fat choy will be gone by junewe got a vegetarian take out yesterday night  the paneer kati roll was good the aloo mutter and naan were ok noth to write home about the ras malai was just aw it was like the milk was burnt
but the worst part of our night was that when we had order paneer tikka masala we were given chicken tikka masala we went home and start to cut the suppos paneer in the entre onli to realiz it was chicken now it is understand that the order got mix up but what irk me was that when i call them to tell about it the owner act like it not possibl and that i was mistaken even though we are vegetarian we know what chicken look like he was extrem rude and ask me to come all the way back to the restaur to examin the dish himself or to email photo of it i decid to do neither coz i was complet piss at the way this was handl i wouldnt have mind if i hadnt gotten my money back but to treat a custom like this all for 10 is unaccept for me terribl way to run a busi and that too when it is new
anyway were never go back and recommend that peopl check their dish befor eat it coz they are never go to accept their mistakthis is easili the most disappoint experi weve had this year 

frustrat make us sign in by give them our phone number which theyr alreadi text to get us to sign up for their mail list
frustr overpr mediocr food
frustr a server who was more interest in the game than in our order
frustr wait all night for our order
frustr get our entre complet wrong
frustr apolog by buy us a kiltlift then charg us 7 for it
frustr wait ten minut in a disorgan crowd for a valet to let us leave

if a restaur that wont let you in or out wont give you the food you order cant cook decent food lie to you and top it off by spam you succeed in cenpho becaus the ambienc is trendi then it reflect poor on all of us here were better than thisi wont be go back as a person of japanes descent i was offend when i pronounc the item proper and my waiter didnt understand me and correct me resay the word with a veri americanenglish pronunci my friend and i order about 8 differ tapa which they brought out all at onc our tabl was so crowd and the manag had told us that they were a veri new restaur and ask for suggest or comment i told her that i felt the plate were too big for the tabl sinc we had no room instead of say to the affect of note or thank you she say to us well the plate are meant to be order one at a time so that they can be focus on one by one to which i said i understand that but as a foodi i like a blend of various flavor or how about if they know that plate should be focus on one by one how about you onli bring the tabl one or two plate at a time till we finish and then bring us the new dish as we finish them how dare they ask me for an opinion or comment then tell me someth like that i ask for green tea and was serv mugicha barley tea which is fine but if for exampl i order a hamburg and you serv me a tofu burger it two differ thing my waiter didnt know the differ yet he told us how he live in japan for year i realiz this is modern fusion food but i onli like one item out of 8 we order 

yonaka mean midnight as in 0000 hour blank slate begin of someth new person opinion was not my kind of fusion or restaurthey have fresh fish that is for sure and i think that they have capabl and compet sushi team  it start off pretti well  i was prompt greet and then given a detail overview of there philosophi around onli serv one item at a time to fulli enjoy each serv  in essenc to focus on the course

i can appreci the desir for a zen experi around the serv  certain at mani of the finer establish i have been to this has been the case

howev they are still go through the grow pain of a new restaur which i found to be surpris  the space is much too big a space for their abil to put out consist and reliabl food  the friend woman manag the front of the hous doe a great job explain the concept they are go for  

howev they are soooo concern with pace so i can focus on one dish at a time that it took 70 minut between my app and my first piec of fish  i had all that time to focus on no food and crappi servic which over shadow the origin they were go for  what littl i got tast great but i would never go back again

a a note to the fellow from austin that rather snobbish insult about everyon he could  you should be embarrass to compar this place to jiro ono and his busi in the ginza tokio subway station  yonaka wasnt consist between prepar of the same dish at the same station let alon over decad  most certain yonaka is not even worthi of a las vega gamerss din award let alon a michelin star

again fresh fish which most can get at their local uwajimaya market ranch 99 or similar market  they also have an interest concept of a fulli prepar bite with the ideal flavor combin but they have a veri long way to go  frank if im get fulli on water while i wait they arent go to sell me veri much food  so whatev success might be found is go to start with figur out a pace of food and a consist qualiti product while they still have the appeal of be newunfortun my last experi has realli chang my mind about return to this busi i was an incred loyal custom but now i will not be go back 
   i was encourag by their employe to download their epoxi app which act as a stamp card give you credit for purchas and then lead up to them offer you a free purchas onc all of the requir amount of stamp are collect 
   today i purchas a larg acai bowl with mix nut which is an extra charg i larg smoothi with a 99 addit ingredi a bagel and cream chees and a child smoothi and peanut butter sandwich it is advertis that kid eat free alway with full purchas and that is veri generous howev i paid full price for all my other item which came out to over 20 when i present the stamp card i was told i am not entitl to a stamp for ani of my purchas due to the child meal be on the hous and that i cant receiv two offer at onc i was not redeem my stamp card i was simpli request a stamp for the purchas i paid full price for also i was never inform nor is it post anywher that i will not receiv a stamp if kid item are part of my purchas also the kid eat free is perman on the menu so i dont understand how that a special offer
  when talk to the owner regard the situat he told me im the onli one in town who is this generous this is as good as it get i was realli shock at his attitud i have brought him busi refer so mani of my friend written posit review in the past and gone out of my way to check in on social media 
  if you are go to have a loyalti card program shouldnt you be reward those custom who are in fact loyal i wasnt ask for anyth special mere a stamp on a virtual card for item i paid full price for if you have limit post them clear verbal them to your custom and pleas dont allow your ego to destroy a great custom relationship i regret to say i wont be back this loyal custom appar isnt worth a 60 stampi have now been there 3 time and each time is it get wors and wors  they could possibl have the worst servic of ani restaur i have ever been to

last time i sat at the bar with a friend and watch our food sit on the counter for 10 minut when the bartend final turn around and realiz there was food on the counter

today we went and sat on the roof we order at 1215 and by 100 we were still wait for our mac and chees burrito  the server told us they had a big parti while the owner then came over and told us the health inspector shut the kitchen down for a half hour  either way i will not be back

on good if you have at least 2 hour to kill for lunchholi crap so i ran in pat run yesterday as part of a group of about 30 come here was plan ahead of time and we had the whole top patio reserv for us it was fun lot of good peopl the weather was perfect we were all high on endorphin so were there everyon hungri and eager to relax have a drink and eat some good food i was starv like readi to gnaw my own arm off for a bit of protein
so we discov there is one server for our parti and wait patient for our order to be taken final it come to our turn  im not sure if i some how offend our server or piss her off but she did not like me i dont know whi i was sit there talk with friend the whole time i wasnt loud wasnt complain about anyth this was in fact the first interact i had with her we were all dress the same so it not like she could say my outfit offend her  i just dont know what her deal was she took the order of the three peopl on my right then the person direct across from me and then the two peopl on my left and start to walk off i said excus me twice and was not acknowledg someon els at in the group i was sit with had to physic tap her on the shoulder and tell her to take my order she did not apolog or even ask what she could get me she stood there and stare at me i place my order and she walk off a  few of us went down to the bar and order drink and then drank them and then stood there and waitedand waitedand wait about 45 minut after we order we notic that peopl that order after us were get their food the food look realli good too big sandwich big burrito and big bowl which is what i order the bowl was serv in one of those chines take out box and consist of egg meat bacon ham or chorizo potato onion and pepper and were full to the brim so final our server come around and take our drink order anoth 15 minut go by and we got food well everyon i was sit with got food i did not i had start to notic that the portion were get smaller and smaller so everyon start to eat and our drink come out again everyon but mine 
final my food come out after everyon i was with had finish their meal 75 minut after i order i final had my foodth chines takeout box was less than half full and was get cold the bacon was limp and clump togeth the food was bland and tasteless no salt and pepper no flavor even the bacon was bland the bacon was bland bacon ughi ate half still had no drink by this point i was grumpi hungri and defeat i dont get it i dont know what the deal was but  it is safe to say that i would never come back herei saw beaver choic profil a long time ago on eden eat and alway want to tri it  i was drive to work one day and drove right past the new place and was so excit  it is liter 3 minut from my hous and about 5 minut from where i work  heck i even email the owner to ask when it would be open  and got a veri nice email back too  

so last saturday me my daughter and my friend went in and got seat right away  the waiter was pretti good too  good start

w got the fri with chees and gravi to start  it was ok but most import fresh and hot  then our dinner came and it was a differ stori  

i got the stuf chicken mash potato salad and cole slaw  my daughter got a hamburg medium and salad  and my friend got meatbal mash potato and cole slaw  the mash potato were cold  my daughter hamburg was well done and the bun was ice cold  the dress on the salad was tasteless as well  not horribl but definit room for improvement

so we have cold food and an incorrect cook meat  but you know what the clencher was  we call the owner over and told her the food was cold  she didnt say a word and walk away never to return  didnt offer to reheat the food mayb throw in a dessert noth  but she was sure greet peopl with hug when they walk in the door prior custom i think   youd think shed work a littl harder to keep new custom  after all wasnt that whi she move to expand her business

guess what  i live close and also work at a veri close and larg offic build  we go out to lunch a lot  you better believ i wont be back and wont bring ani of my friend and cowork in either   there never an excus for poor custom servic especi by the owner of the restaur  a waiter usual noth to lose  the owner has everyth to lose  i hope she read thisi give it one star for their custom service

i went to this restaur on their open day after read an article

panchero mexican grill a fastcasu mexican restaur is open jan 29 in chandler and theyll sell 1 burrito to mark the occasion

burrito will be avail for a buck a week later 4 pm to 6 pm feb 5 at 2051 w chandler blvd suit 1

after be told to come back feb 5th  i show the employe the articl and she said no it was written wrong i drove over 20 minut to get here i told her and ask for the manag she said he was busyr too busi to talk to an happi custom 

i am not unreason after i left i can see their ad was poor written and easili misunderstood i would expect a manag to come out and speak with me and explain what happen in the least or act like they care about their custom 

i dont like to give one star but in the few case that i have it is usual for bad servic i would have paid full price for their burrito but after the way they handl the situat i have no choicyuck 

i saw this place open up not too long ago and was excit to tri it out i went in tonight with low expect keep in mind that this is still a fastfood type place but the food was just aw i am not a panda express fan so i wouldnt suggest you go there but you may as well consid what they serv here

i order vietnames beef pho kung pao chicken and a vietnames ice coffee

th ice coffe was premix and pour into my cup from a larg plastic contain you could get better premix ice coffe from 711 at half the cost dont be deceiv this is not what vietnames ice coffe should tast like

th pho was veri bland and ined and is the worst ive tast in my life no exagger the broth was complet flavorless i believ they just use the water they boil the noodl in the noodl were thick and mushi the beef was in cut in chunk notslic and was veri tough i just couldnt get myself to finish this

th kung pao chicken didnt tast as bad as the other two item but was pathet for what you pay the portion is small there are onli a few piec of chicken with veri littl veget the contain was most sauc and rice

avoidso much potenti so much lame 

arriv saturday morn about 1130 with a starv famili in tow great at door by sour face teenag hostess told 1520 minut wait that is accept the rest of the experi was not accept at the door i could see 5 open tabl with 3 group wait oh well wait 20 min was call by sour face and offer a tabl in the main walk path at front of the restur i request a tabl out of the path of everi one point to at 3 tabl put togeth next to the window her respons was that is for 6 peopl she then roll eye pull the tabl apart threw the menus in the middl of the tabl and left we sat wait for 10 minut for a server to take the order she seem pleasant enough i order the ham benidict and ask that she insur the egg be poach soft we then wait for 30 min for the food to show after ask for her to check on the food i check the egg one was undercook runni egg white the other poach hard i then ask to see her she return i said i ask that the egg be cook to my like soft poach she said they arei respond that a hard yolk is not soft she respond what do you want me to do i ran out patienc just like this run on sentanc and ask that she take the plate and remov the charg 1098 she offer to take the charg off and remak i said i was not interest in a new plate i did not want to wait and i do not complain to get free food she walk away it actual was kinda of a strang interact 

now it becom an irritat experi a woman approach the tabl doe not introduc herself and start interrog me about the egg i said they were not cook to my spec i would rather not have anoth order i would rather not discuss it ani further i told her that i would pay for what i order she state that she was sent by her director of oper to state that they thought the egg were fine i then restat i would pay for the food otherwis she was make me and my famili uncomfort she interrupt state that she did not want to make me uncomfort i repli that it was too late and request she leav me alon she walk away no addit follow up no refil on the drink check drop the charg for my food remov my famili thought their food was ok 

mi wife comment as we left was that was too bad we need a local breakfast place i must agree

mi predict is this place will last for about 6 month mani restur have come and go in that particular busi park 

if the owner would be interest in some advic you might want to invest in some custom servic train that would elev your staff compet level to match a ten dollar plate of bacon and eggok  so my friend and i use to go to twin peak in scottsdal  it was fun but it took 30 minut to get there so we didnt go veri often  the food was decent and the wait staff was friend and abl to get our order correct  it was also pack everi day for lunch which is general a good sign

so imagin our reaction when a new tp open up on camelback  awesome

mi friend went there while i was out of town and said the food and servic were aw  mayb they order wrong  mayb they had a bad server  who knows

so we went there last week so i could do a qualiti check  there were 6 of us  everyon got their food at differ time  i order fish taco which was my go to choic at the scottsdal locat  the first one was ok the second one was bad  i stop eat after one bite  at least at this time the server was nice and apolog for all the problem in the kitchen

and today  you can see that i realli gave this place a chanc  we had more peopl from out of town that want to go for a long lunch  so despit my friend origin bad experi and anoth one the week befor we decid to dare the peak again

mistake

on guy recommend wing as he had them at anoth tp and said they were decent  at this point decent was all i was hope for  so i order the wing  anoth person order grill chicken strip  same usual fire drill  long wait for the food and then everyon receiv their meal at differ time  the waitress told my friend with the chicken strip dont worri your chicken taco will be out soon  um that not what i order  i dont want to imagin what happen when she ran away from the tabl  

well the wing were aw  i challeng myself to eat 3 of them the most cook look one i could see and stole some fri from other  

when the grill chicken strip final arriv they look disgust  like someon had microwav some chicken strip and then tri to put some grill mark on them  i told my friend not to eat them

and then  oh there an and then  whi yes there is  the check  there were 8 of us  one guy was pay for 3 peopl and everyon els was pay separ  we do this almost daili without issu  the waitress came back to the tabl about 4 time befor everyth was final correct and sign  

the one thing i will say is that it doesnt seem to be the fault of the wait staff  this place clear suffer from bad manag  i will never go backi liter had the worst restaur experi in the past 10 year last night if you like be call rude by the manag have your appet show up 30 min after you order them and your beer forgotten you should go here if you dont like that sort of thing you should go somewher els 

i also found it interest that our first waitress attitud chang as soon as she figur out we were a tabl of gay cant help but feel as though that had someth to do with the crappi servic we receiv from her

her are more detail even after out waitress left our tabl mid drink order to get anoth tabl drink when he ask her for it we were never rude to her onc nor call her out for that action howev when i ask where my beer was 15 min after order it all other had been deliv and when we told her we want to wait to order dinner until our last parti member show up appar that was rude a new waitress show up and said she didnt know whi she was assign to us right after her one of the manag show up and ask if everyth was okay and we told her that we were wait for our appet and my beer we ask where our other waitress went and the manag told us that she was taken off the tabl becaus she said we were be rude to her what whi would a manag tell you this even if it was true needless to say we drank our beer ate the appet and left the experi as we were leav with manag 2 is even more shock but sinc i didnt experi it first hand ill leav it to other member of our parti to explain in a post of their own

do not go here  there are better qualiti establish in the same area with better food and better servici hate to say it but i was veri disappoint with my experi 

befor i go deeper i will say that the guac is veri good but that doe not save this place in ani way 

let start with the food i order what is their version of fajita now i saw chees on the list of ingredi for the dish and to me meat and chees is not a bad thing what i did not expect is meali textur meat as if defrost wrong meat cook on a flat iron that had no flavor of it own and a puddl of salti oili chees that was disgust the flavor were out of balanc and one of the worst dish i have ever seen or tast the tortilla were wet and sticki on one side and dri on the other i mean how do you screw that up

servic start out good there was a delay in get our first and second round of drink but i can understand a busi bar the fact that our server fill up an ice tea a tabl away and did not bother to fill my water glass when it was empti was not good but when she lean across a rail that was behind me to ask me if i want anoth drink is where it went down hill three step more and she could have been tabl side so now we forward to me tell our server about my main cours she take it away i never see a manag and befor we could consid order desert coffe or even finish our second round of drink she plop the check in front of my face the ask oh you didnt want ani thing els did you  wow i have never been so insult of felt like i was be told to get the hell out in my life i was so mad i could not speak and no manag ever bother to follow up with us about dinner

i am in the servic industri and have work in everi thing from chevi to michelin star rate establish and this by far was the worst experi i have ever had i will never return to this placeit too bad you cant give negat star for a palc like wildsid grill

first i want to address the 5 star and posit review which are post by the owner and their friend i call bs as no one has a good time at this overpr small portion and horribl manag place

a coupl of the server are veri nice but the manag suck they dont care about how bad the food is as they just want the local drunk to come in

w arriv on a saturday night at 6 and though the place had onli 10 peopl in it we had to wait 10 minut till anyon greet us and took us to a booth after anoth 15 minut a server came by and took our drink order and then we wait anoth 15 minut for her to come back with our drink and a menu and i mean a menu even though there was three of us at the tabl we tri to keep her at the tabl so we could order but she left becaus the manag was yell at her across the place to come over to him he was a jerk we could hear him scream at the girl about how she screw up his friend order and she told him she didnt even take their order as it was anoth girl guy was foul mouth and so unprofessional

so after 10 minut she came back to our tabl and we could tell she had been cri she took our order and this is where the fun realli begin not we wait 30 minut and watch other tabl who came in after us get better servic and their food we had order two burger and the salmon dish final our food came or we thought as the now male server had brought anoth tabl order to our tabl we watch him go to 5 tabl befor find that lucki tabl that had to watch their food travel around the place 10 minut after that he brought our order and the food was pathet both burger were way overcook as in bad burnt we had order medium not charcoal the salmon was small and dri as in veri dryover cook we told the male server we want to talk to the manger and he said he would tri but that he was busi and might be abl to come over  realli  we watch him sit by the bar talk to a girl for 10 more minut 

at this point we had had enough and got up to leav and he race to the door to stop us think we were run out on the check we told hiim everyth we went through and he final move with no apolog just a stupid look on his face and then he said guess you wont be back

boy is he right and anyon that is stupid enough to go here need mental help

thi place is pathet and should be close one star becaus no star is not an option

thi is the exact email i sent to the breweri after leav this establish about my experi which has yet to be acknowledg 

pretti disappoint by last night experi or lack there of we got to the breweri a few minut befor what i was told was our reserv time and just short after a parti of 4 had gotten there i heard the host tell the parti that sinc they did not have a reserv it would be about a 3040 minut wait the parti move asid to discuss if they want to wait or not the host then ignor my husband and i for 5 minut while she convers with 3 other employe all who seem to not have a care in the world when we final got her attent she found our name on the reserv list and inform us it would still be at least 3045 minut befor we could be sat now longer than the group who walk in befor us that didnt have a reserv we have no problem over look minor servic issuesespeci at a new place when dine out but when it come at the expens of wast our entir even that just inexcus whi bother take reserv scratch that whi email me and ask me if id like to have a reserv for your establish if you have no intent of honor it sure you mayb think we were go to honor it just 45 minut late which mean it would take me how long to get food and beer after arriv at this imaginari tabl also 3045 minut lame

i stop there to get some cupcak a few day befor valentin day i pull up around 630pm after work not know what time they close the light were still on so i was glad to be there befor they close 

i park my car and start walk up just as a woman walk out of showboy with a box of cupcak the guy who was help her held the door look at me walk up and then close and lock the door i was liter feet away i went up to the door and knock readi to ask to just quick go in and choos and leav but there was no respons i knock sever time but the guy was nowher to be seen 

realli lamei was soo excit to tri this place base on the plethora of review plus i love dessert  it just didnt stack up on it own or compar to other local bakeri 

i might be miss someth but this is not the amaz cupcak placebakeri it hype up to be i will start with the pros the decor is cute a littl overdon but cute 
servic was pleasant and friendlythey had a sour appl sampl which we tri it tast like a green jolli rancher was lime green in color and left an after tast 

cupcak we order the carrot cake cupcak with an orang frost the strawberri cupcak the chocol with peanut butter and the chocol with salt caramel the carrot cake was realli dens and the frost was reminisc of orang flavor you know like tang the strawberri had no flavor and didnt tast like strawberri howev it was a hot red color which was slight off put consid all the dye use to probabl achiev that color the chocol cupcak was redeem but it wasnt amaz just ok the frost again howev was just not good the intens of the flavor leav a strang after tast in your mouth 

the macaroon  i feel bad review them but they sell them and we bought them so here goe we had two flavor the green appl and the salt caramel textur not a macaroon at all they are hard and not airi like the usual macaroon flavor were off they actual remind me of a shortbread cooki with ice between them as small as they are we  didnt even eat finish them 250 or 275  for one i cant rememb exact but that crazi for how bad they werei had high hope but stay away ive been here twice hope my first tri was a bad night for them as other have said the staff is not experienc not friend and almost pissi that they are work 
we walk in and the bar tender just stare at me and my hub a patron had to tell us to find our own seat thenther was a shard of glass in my margarita the manag handl it poor blame dishwasher

1st vist

loc on 5th street and roosevelt right smack dab in the middl of the art district  

outdoor seatingpatio with a great view of downtown

th din room has tabl and barstool seat with an ultra modern motif

and i just had the best omelet in my life 
not kidding
mi drip coffe was hot strong and smooth i love itrespons to benji
thi guy benji the owner is clueless i write a review detail exact what happen  to me and he is flat out call me a liar how bout your a liar benji the dog and your bar is a mess and you and your goon squad will be out of busi short adio liar and bad managbad bad bad

first of all let me prefac by say my fianc and i have been to mani of the zip around town and enjoy the food and atmospher but this new locat in chandler is a horribl  we sat down at the bar on a saturday even for a few brew and munchi and to watch some game but we never got wait on  the regular bar tender pass us by at least 3 time and the blond behind the bar was do dish and just ignor us complet  some young guy walk up a few stool down and she practic ran to help them pass us by again  we were blown away on how terribl the servic is at the chandler locat we walk out after 30 minut have never been wait on  we have a home in chandler and we will never be back to this god aw restaur again  fire the entir staffi went with the star of the menu the kobe burger with a brioch bun truffl aioli sear foie gras frizzl onion watercress cherri tomato and a fri quail egg despit all those top i was brought out a burger that was complet flavorless and sad disappoint the meat on it own had no season at all and was just lost in the burger the patti was not form well for the size of the bun and was way too narrow and thick it was also quit dri despit the mess of greas that form on my plate earli on or mayb that where all the moistur went it was also cook more than the medium rare that i order which i heard mani time prior to my meal that this is a consist problem here the brioch bun was also dri and actual cold to the touch when brought out the foie gras was nonexist except for mayb one or two bite and the quail egg wasnt notic at ani point the cherri tomato were the onli stand out flavor and it was a travesti when my girlfriend accident drop one when i hand her my burger to sampl it dryness im not quit sure what the frizzl onion is as they werent notic either 

the fri were even more horribl raw soggi and cold with the tast of raw potato the fat fri were actual fair hot upon arriv and even cook a bit more than our skinni fri but still not near enough to make them edibl the skinni fri with parmesan were liter just fri with a huge clump of shred parmesan pile on also neither accompani aioli was brought out initi onli a small cup of ketchup we had to ask for the item that are suppos to come with the fri this is an issu i also saw a coupl time in their comment book that was hand to us with the bill the garlic aioli a redund statement tast more like ranch than anyth the truffl aioli was decent enough to mask the raw potato flavor but still wasnt that great

if this meal couldnt get ani wors let me tell you about our groupon deal which is a total scheme on the part of the restaur the deal is 49 for suppos 100 worth of food and includ two burger with side one share dessert and one bottl of wine onc our meal was done and my groupon was scan we were still brought a check for 2584 which was instant confus on the check they list a 99 not 100 groupon meal sale tax for the full 99 amount and an 18  gratuiti bring the total to 12484 they then subtract 99 for the valu of the groupon not 100 and expect 2584 from you to complet the meal first of all after do some research i have found some specif tax law about this such as if a restaur offer a patron upon present of a coupon two meal for the usual price of one the price of the free meal is exclud from the meal tax the tax is due on onli the actual amount the restaur charg the patron mean that theyv charg me more tax than theyr legal allow to second of all i have no problem tip my waiter on the entir valu of our meal as oppos to the groupon price but forc me to pay 18 minimum for two peopl regardless of my experi is absolut absurd a gratuiti is 100 option with all meal sure it would be a total dick move not to tip a waiter especi if theyv been great but for this to be a mandatori portion of my bill is absolut infuri so without ani choic of my own my 49 groupon by default is 7484 or a clever way for the restaur to get anoth 25 out of each groupon deal and who know how much of that 18 actual went to my waiter

with all that be said how do i even sum this up forget about the groupon for a minut if i had paid the full price of 100 for this meal i would have been so horribl disappoint that i would not have walk out of there until both of our burger and fri were replac with absolut perfect version of what we order if this is possibl of achiev  if we had paid just the 49 plus a tip that i deem appropri i would still be complet disappoint with this meal as such a claim gourmet restaur should be spot on everi time and this clear wasnt but now factor in some question charg on my bill and you have all the ingredi for a veri low score horribl overpr overcook inconsist burger and almost raw ined fri serv without their proper side leav me with no choic but to give this an extrem low score and my highest recommend to stay as far away as you can from this place until they can mayb get their act togeth if your look for a good night out in summerlin with some fun food better atmospher and one of the best burger ive had in vega go to view wine bar down the streetthis is a must not burger joint unless you want to overpay for a burger   my famili and i sat down at a picnic tabl albeit a fanci one which was alreadi occupi by anoth famili  this didnt bother me as much as my first glanc at the menu  when i saw the regular burger was 10 plain then 2 addit for each item includ that of ketchup i couldnt take it ani longer and walk out  unfortun my wife just order a glass of wine and the calamari so she and my daughter stuck around  we came separ to the restaur so leav was not a big deal  i was later told the calamari was horribl  she did say howev that the wine was good  henc the reason for the one star
al i have to say is what is this owner think  yes you are in summerlin but if you do not make chang soon you wont be here much longerugh this was realli bad terribl servic that took way too long for our order to be taken when there were onli 3 parti 2 server and a manag in the front of house

food was as bad actual wors when you factor in the price my burger came with onion rings4 of them they were the frozen one youd expect at ani chain restaur and inexplic they came out 5 min befor the burger

i tri the lamb burger it was suppos to be medium but was well done i cut it in half and the next thing i know my plate was swim in water the untoast potato bun was soggi and limp and the burger was dri top on the burger were feta and guacamol i must have miss the guacamol when i saw it on the menu otherwis i wouldnt have order it i love guacamol but it has no place on a lamb burger mix in with feta cheese

definit not go back especi sinc 2 minut in either direct i can be at lbs bachi burger or smashburgthirti two buck for two fish taco two icedtea and an order of fish and chips
im open with this in order to partial explain the low star count

mi spous enjoy the fish taco which did live up to all the hype sad i had a basket of fish and chip and it did not
of the three piec of fish the first piec sampl was foul reek of spoil fish and tast like jack mackerel one of the fishiest flavor in all seven seas

th second piec was delight compar to the first while the third had me on the edg of my seat wonder whether it was spoil or flavor 
i took a small bite to test the water it was neither somewher in the middl with it fishi odor and complet lack of flavor 

i should have sent it back but didnt sinc id just gotten into an argument with my spous over what to order and need to prove she didnt outord me
so i ate this stinki load o bait by coat it with ketchup hold my nose and swallow it whole like i was a fuck sea lion or something
fast forward four hours

im sit here with a bad case of heartburn a sick stomach a wallet that thirti two dollar lighter and a spous who cant wait to go back
wel she can go back and eat the whole damn place out of fish taco for all i care but im never go back fuck that i have principl and one of them is this

if im go to eat out it should never be a mysteri at the veri least i have certain expect and albeit low theyr expect just the same one such is to not get blindsid by know munch on anyth stinkier than all fucktri out this joint sinc im a real ramen lover this ramen place is definit one of the bad one in this town ive eaten at lot of ramen hous but this honest is just a let down to the ramen world i order the miso ramen and it was over season with salt hope the fri rice was a good one it was just as salti as the broth a littl hint of salti wouldnt hurt but this just beat the whole flavor we came in on a friday afternoon and the server at that time wasnt realli of ani help toward our complain if you want an authent tast of ramen and rice bowl take my advic and tri the other ramen place in town theyr more than a hand out thereif i could i would give this shit whole negat 3 star we order at 1030 and they got here at 115 am our food was cold they gave us a chees pizza when we order pepperoni their excus was that they had too mani order at that time bitch pleaspho temp hold the crown as the absolut worst dine experi of my life asid from have bland beef pho and a forgett attempt at banh mi pho temp was filthi and doom by poor service

i call to ask when the restaur would close on a monday night and the man on the phone was imposs to understand he said someth about 9 pm he also said someth about 10 

is it open from 9 am to 10 pm lobbi open till 9 and carryout till 10

to be safe i hop on grubhub and submit my order while drive to the restaur 

when i arriv i explain i would like to use a groupon to pay for my order the woman work at the restaur in broken english told me i couldnt use my groupon for a carryout order 

that fine i told her we could just save the groupon for anoth time 

she told me to just eat the meal there and all would be ok

so i sat down and was brought a menu she ask me to order i told her i just want what i alreadi had order on grubhub she said to forget about the grubhub order and just order again 

i ask if the onlin order would be cancel she said yes so i order and halfway through my meal out came a second meal in togo containers

so there i was full of food and stare at the same meal pack for later the woman alreadi had redeem my groupon and she expect payment for the second meal 

put in a terribl situat by her inabl to communic or find a compromis i simpli tip well and walk out on the togo order

th entir experi was so upset i wont return to pho temp1 waaaaay over price 
2 after be sat we were ignor for over 15 minut we left no water no waitress noth and it wasnt even busi it was 12 full at best so a tabl of 9 just got up and left

but  terribl servic asid no small bowl of guacamol is worth 11 it just not and their drink are the same stori for what they were offer it was way too much i can and did go around the corner for some delici thai food and a beer for what it would have cost me to have just 1 of their premium read midlevel margarita 

and if your think im just a cheapskat your woefulli mistaken go hunt down the laundri room i was drink there the night befor and the cocktail were worth everi pennione word over price  ok two word went there on open day two 7 dollar for a corona 1100 for guaq yeah authent mex food what is not authent are the price care about gentrifi yourself out of exist hip and cool will not keep the door openwed walk by the restaur to peek in and talk to the girl out front about a menu and ani question we had a friend ask if they use lard in their refri bean but she said she didnt know he ask about vegetarianvegan option on the menu she didnt know

w made the mistak of go in the next day for lunch aw servic and high price and the music was a littl loud i was in with a larg parti that got seat fair prompt and just as prompt ignor no contact past the door the restaur was bare half full and there were clear wait staff that werent realli all that busi 

the food i saw around the room was tini portion especi for the high price i wasnt keen on pay 8 for a bottl of corona go here if you hate servic and yourself and if you like spend a lot of money on be cool after about 1520 minut of no contact from the staff our parti march outhow do you say this place suck in spanish muy mala seem too nice first their servic is all about sale want to start with our most overpr and unsatisfi menu item becaus if not well judg you that sort of thing i did enjoy the well margarita but for 9 more than five sip over ice would be nice 

and the food puta madr la comida was beyond bad it is actual mean to serv food this dull and charg this much for it the carnita taco were dri flavorless and lazi the mole was a onenot past over dri chicken enchilada both astound overpr funni how often fanci mexican place make you nostalg for cheap one this place is all style no substancmy girlfriend and i have come in here a lot late but never again bug bug were crawl out from under the fish case at the bar never have i been so disgust in my life to add insult they offer us a discount of 10 and even wors a tabl of 9 and a tabl of 4 just walk in they continu to use food out of that cooler and serv it to peopl disgust aw degrading

to top it off as were leav the waitress told us and i quot this doesnt happen veri oftenoh taco guild  

i bitter resent have to give you a singl star  pretti much everyth is a disast from hightop stool design by torquemada to the brazen over price drink fetch by sur independ wealthi cocktail server  our server look like a lumberjack yet act like serg from bever hill cop  

i had two taco torn lettuc cup  what i got was half a head of wet butter lettuc with a neat tablespoon of sodium soak protein in the middl  the pork adobo was indistinguish from the coffe brais brisket  truli stun for 395 each  i have eaten more satisfi fare out of an mre packet  

it is loud insid which amplifi the horrif choic to put a jukebox in a restaur  there is a ton of servic staff none of which will make eye contact with a patron beg for a drink  

the chip were fresh and crunchi and the salsa offer were not bad  perhap that merit the singl star i was forc to givethis buffet just open friday in the spot were hibachi grill use to be and it look the same with the realli funni resteroom sign that i tri to photo but couldnt sad i left hungri with an upset stomach over the food i tri i start with some sushi that sort of look dri out and when i tri a piec the rice wasnt season and was just gooey and fell aparti was hope for some tasti seafood sinc this is a seafood buffet im not sure i did see food but i saw cod and what they call salmon that was a white flesh fish here i realli like fish and i wasnt abl to eat either of them the tast was too offens i put some veget on my plate but the broccoli was mushi and had a strang tast to it

 they had one salad that wasnt complet aw but it tast like old fish it was the seawe with cucumb and radish i was abl to pull out the radish and eat the radish but the rest tast veri fishy

w were here on the last night it was a casino and were disgust by the flock of zapponian all dress exact the same like a cult play bad wed music on the jukebox and have a grand old time celebr the fact that their dear leader was about to put a bunch of peopl out of a job

mor recent i liter spent a halfhour attempt to track down anyon who want to take my money for the diet coke i order a person who valu their time wouldv just walk out it 4 cent worth of syrup for christ sake but theyv got promin secur everywher presum to keep the old regular and other charact from the neighborhood out we cant have ani of those scum in toni new downtown can we

for a place back by a compani with an outspoken devot to servic the servic here is realli atrocious

unfortun despit all of it flaw and the fact that im basic support the evil empir destroy downtown by go there i will probabl be back when i get sick of work in my windowless offic in the ogden ill definit sit at the bar next time lest they forget about meagainthis place is like my worst nightmar i had an open mind come here even though i kinda knew the jist of this place was a loungebar with board game i hate board game in fact i loath them this was like be stuck on a cruis ship and the onli thing to do is board game 

mi jameson  ginger ale tast like toilet water  i assum it was the ginger ale from the gun and the bartend was less than friend not to mention the park lot was a joke liter 30 space mayb one way onli so get in and out was a delight i never want to come here againhi gold spike im a nativ downtown and your establish seem to put a bad tast in my mouth everi time i set foot in it

get your staff in check ive eaten at your diner mani time sinc youv reopen never to be acknowledg in order to be seat and wind up seat myself and my friend at the bar insid the diner after a solid amount of wait time and attempt eye contact with a server then still get no menu it like everyon who work here is overwhelm and that your fault not your employe especi  over at the bar hes in a veri bad mood and not realli tri hard to hide it 

you suck i serious hate the gold spike ever sinc you guy took over major bummer heard you pay the band well though too bad i dont even want to watch my friend play when you book them becaus it such a colleg frat underemploy hipster nightmar 
everi time all the timei was wait to tri this new spot so i final did

a you can tell im not a fan

im not a hater nor a guy who has a bad experi and open an account just to trash a place so this is my opinion base on my visit

servic pretti bad it was like a bizarr play with two waiter who didnt know what the other was do thing like one bring more salsa and the other ask if we want more salsa or one took off to the kitchen after take the order and the other show up ask if we were readi to order awkward 

decor this is probabl the onli highlight of the place nice decor differ flare pretti interest artwork on the walls

ambi the music was super loud the light was extrem soft flashlight recommend and the music play was hideous but come on everyth start with the name joyrid realli ayfkm what has that to do with a mexican restaur the wheel on the wall might give the feel of a joyrid to nowhere

food the onli dish that bare approv was the beet salad not that mexican though the cochinita taco unev plus it a huge pet peev for me that restaur use name to call dish that have noth to do with the real thing carn asada taco meh plus the tortilla was break and everyth was fall apart the street corn was a tragedi pack with butter i tri the strawberri fresh water wich was actual pretti good although super sweet mayb order one and water it down would be the right way to go the almond horchata same thing with the cochinita they label someth with a name that is so far away from the real thing that it doesnt make sens at all the rice was also gooey and hard not well done and it seem that they were stir it while cooking

pric omfg are you kid me now 350 for a taco and that the less expens one everyth is super expens special for what you get

sorri to the team who brought this concept but there a lot of work to do if they want to be there for the long runi gave this place two triesi thought the first time was just a hiccup becaus they were newli open and they need to get their groov togeth 
but i was wrong

when i pickup a takeout order i alway look in each box to make sure everyth is right i fail to do so this time  i took a quick peek at a few box seem to be right but i was wrong
when i got back to the offic we open our box and two out of four were wrong  the two that were wrong were mix up  i drove back they remad it but did not seem concern about the qualiti of their servic 
one staff member tri to bring me a left over smoothi to help out cool dudeleft over  uggh no thank 

about a week later the offic want to tri it again so this time i made sure to look in the boxeswel 3 out of 4 were right  of cours mine was the one they mess up on again  i even look in the box and it seem to look good 

i did the make your own bowl  but i guess what i had ask for was too complic for them becaus they end up make a signatur bowl they alreadi offer  

on the ticketreceipt it is list correct so i do not know who is be lazi in the kitchen  

i did not go back to fix it it just wasnt worth my time 

i probabl will not tri this place again unless i am forc towent in for breakfast this morn and had a great meal  i had the pancak with egg whiteswond meal  my husband had the breakfast burrito and realli enjoy it  everyth is fresh prepar and made to order 

we were realli enjoy our time until we were readi to leav  at this time i watch as one of the employe climb onto the food prep counter to grab a contain of protein powder that was abov her reach  she stood on the food prep counter with her shoe onyuck  would not have been that big of a dealbut she didnt disinfect the counter or even wipe it off befor she start use the exact same surfac to prepar a smoothi for the next custom  she put fresh fruit and veget on the counter in the exact spot she was just stand  she saw me watch her and didnt seem to think it was a big deal  

i would assum this would violat a dozen or so health code  the bottom of shoe are fill with all kind of disgust thing and belong no where near food prep  after see this i wont be back  i dont think i can trust the cleanli of the establishment

thi revel make me sad as i have alway enjoy my food here and rave about itwow we were so surpris by the qualiti of food we order deliveri for the onetop 12 medium buffalo wing and 2 liter of coke 

the pizza was a thin limp greasi sad specimen that easili split into a congeal latticework of chees and bread there was no tomato sauc 

the wing were cook hard and were so plain we had to go on a buffalo sauc search we found about a teaspoon worth most of it stuck on the backsid of the foil 

dip sauc came with the wing it wasnt blue chees it wasnt ranch it actual remind me of the homemad french onion powder you mix with sour cream 

the onli thing i wasnt disappoint with was the coke 

we took pictur so you wouldnt think we were lying

upd on
 april 21 2014 i was notifi by yelp that my photo of the pizza and wing had been remov becaus the photo and caption werent general repres of the busi im hope that mean my terribl experi was oneina millionmay i give negat star  after a long week of coordin 700 state test for my school i felt that i had earn a nice break so happi hour at the attic it was  my friend doe barr class nearbi and suggest the place  i had high expect i could say i was disappoint but that would be an understat  when i left there i had intim knowledg of what it feel like to be treat like a third class citizen my friend and i were blatant disrespect by not one not two but three differ employe they didnt even tri to feign ani sort of semblanc of custom servic ive been to some pretti subpar place with soso food and crappi servic but this by far was the worst experi i have ever had anywher   it took me a good week to stop be aggress  piss off i cant say anyth to the qualiti of the food becaus we never got that far but i can say that if your feel masochist this is a great choic  your truli a great lover of a good glass of pinot gasp left an almost full glass there to be pour down the drain  the saddest part of my whole experi is that they dont even care the older blond hostess who look to be the manag didnt even tri to pretend to care this is not some 5 star elit restaurantand ive been to some and they certain dont treat peopl like this   i feel it is my duti to warn peopl to stay away from this place  check out ohso or postino or even chick fil a for that matter  trust me youll be glad you did   still piss and it been a coupl week   i live in this area and trust me i will never set foot in this place again ever


someon request to know more of the stori here is a kind of synopsis
let see how to trim down the convolut stori here it is is a nutshel  
they know and rather arrog decid to seat anoth coupl befor us the gentleman was wear scrub read  doctor  then they argu about it two peopl  i saw the coupl actual walk up the stair and my friend name was alreadi written on their chalkboard  but no they were right  not the coupl mind you the employees
th waitressbartend threw our chang at us liter and said some snarki comment as she walk away mind you this is all while were sit on the wait bench  the manag and the other hostess open talk about us and point at us and proceed to argu with us as we walk out  as we final made a smart decis and left  when i left and the valet guy ask how our night was i ask him if we were on a hidden camera show  
i told one of my other friend about it and she found a blog call how i becam a douchebag diner  googl it that pretti much is a parallel to our feel as we left but of cours more eloqu puti had low expect walk in here i had read the review and had my friend tell me avoid the place  i was will to give the place a chanc and what better than happi hour  right i mean staff should be on top of thing and  there should be a good crowd on a saturday

boy was i wrong place was empti that should have been a sign to turn and run but i sat at the bar and hope it was just a off day 

the servic suck  suck  suck   the drink and food was over price for happi hour sure they are pack on ladi night but if a irish bar has to resort to give away the hous to surviv then it not a irish bar  hell the barmaid mix up my drink twice and then told me she didnt normal work happi hour so she had no clue what was on offer and then seem piss off that she wasnt work a good shift 

trust me i know about irish bar i was born and rais in ireland  ive live in vega sinc 97 so ive seen all the bar come and go and unless the owner not the manag  doe someth this pub is not go to last  

i wont be back and neither will ani of my friend  

if you are go to town squar  hit yard hous or the english bar on the same level as this bar 

or if you want a decent irish pub hit up rira at mandalay bay and ask for junior or fitzi  local get 40 off food on friday  


sorri mc fs you are more of a plastic paddi pub than a real irish pub fix your menu staff and price not to mention your atmospher it like walk into a cave not a good cave either like the bat cave more of a the hill have eye cavea friend and i were go to have lunch at paul pelmeni today  after see the lack of sanitari food handl by the lone employe we decid to eat elsewher  get a case of gastroenter was not on my to do list

i watch the employe handl green and other food item with his bare hand  i then saw him take a few order handl the cash use the credit card machin and answer the telephon  he then went back to handl the food with his bare hand without wash them

mi friend and i were at the restaur at 1pm on a weekday  there were onli a few peopl in there and onli one person work  with such an appal  lack of sanitari food handl i can see whi there were so few custom  i would never consid eat here after what i sawoverr overpr underwhelmed

3 word to describ my dine experi at max tonight

cam here for dinner with my mom and a coupl of her cowork we came just as they open for dinner 5pm as state on the sign at the door  howev there were so mani peopl seat and eat alreadi when we got there  so much for a 5pm dinner time

anyway on to the food we order pansit bihon lechon kawali pork sisig nilagang baka and the famous whole chicken

i was so unimpress with everyth we order i felt there was a definit lack of tast and flavor to all the dish we order as for their famous chicken mehhh ill take jollibe fri chicken ani day  i was most disappoint with the nilagang baka  we went to max restaur in san francisco a coupl week back and it was one of the best nilagang baka i ever had but sad this locat could not replic that same great tast soup 

the price to me seem a bit steep as well for food that not all that great the onli posit thing i have to say about tonight dine experi was the servic our server was friend and attent the space of the restaur is not half bad either 

will i come back mayb onc the open hoopla die down and they get the food right but i dont forse it happen in the near futurultim disappoint bar none

mi hope were high hope to partak in all the love get thrown around about this place but it fell as flat as a sixti year old biker chick tit and it didnt polish my belt buckl one bit

w walk in and are veri overdress be one of the few not wear flip flop or ass hole short so when we final seat ourselv and are approach  by a wonderbra  ugg wear young ladi who suggest we take the train wheel off and have a craft beer i look at her and wonder if she realiz i spend more on craft beer annual than she spent on her boob job hell ive been drink craft beer long befor she got out of her train bra i know craft beer i age craft beer ive been to numer breweri hell ive made homemad craft beer so dont talk to me like im some yuppi slum at an over smokey over pricey hipster bar

i order an item form their bourbon menu an elijah craig 18 more on that later

w also order a ballast point habenero sculpin and a epic brainless on peach they bring these and im look at these glass think nice sampler glass but oh no these diminut glass are the actual serv glass they charg 6 a draw for they are bare half a bottl worth and they have no head  spotti glass retain littl head  beer server 101 fail  and the girl had us give her the number from the beer list as she didnt know the name of the beer well enough to place an order without them weak 

and we wait and wait and wait for the appet meanwhil observ the waitress art dodg the drunken featheri hand of glass eye patron who think and theyr correct that them play furious air guitar is amus it is but not for the reason they think it is

i have to say the chef that night was much more talent than ace deserv all the bar food  mean the fri onion ring pizza bit and pretzel  was veri veri good not the usual barf food that pass for bar food gotta give them credit for that it would have been nice to not have to scroung utensil and napkin from anoth tabl though 
 
and who the hell decid to charg their outlandish price for beer a fing genius that who abyss for 40 a bottl the bottl price are insan their tap list was decent but not the great thing peopl rave about most can be had at total wine for a fraction of the price guess that pay for all the tv screen you can shake a best buy at

and that elijah craig 18 they didnt have it but they did pad it onto my bill good thing im not the usual drunken sot who doesnt look and just pay so that whi they kept come over and ask if id like more beer

so what we have isnt the craft brew mecca peopl claim but rather an averag place that make a kill off the craft brew nametoday is offici the day i give it a one star everi time i come here it alway someth differ one time he didnt add ani boba i ask are you guy out of boba he said oh i didnt know you want boba on the menu it say it come with boba he couldnt add it at that time becaus i ad green tea ice cream on top so it wasnt worth do the whole thing all over again so i let it go major of the time they are out of someth green tea ice cream is most out and the last time here was earlier today he almost did everyth right except for the part where he left to go to the back and left my drink in the blend machin blend for more than two minut i order a slush not a milk tea if i wasnt in a rush i would tell him to make it all over again last time come here it good to come her to check it out at least onc if they have all the flavor of ice cream they say they provid and make the drink right either that or they need to hire someon new who can make the drink righthabit burger a habit i do not want

tonight after shop up a storm with the mrs buy up scottsdal for christma we were famish raven hungri starv and run on empti we thought let tri that new burger place 

so after the umteenth jewelri store it was late real late we jump into the famili truckster and gun it over to cactus befor it bluehair could cut us off onc again in their mad dash of the xmas frenzi weve battl all day pull into a welcom empti lot and slid into habit burger it was new clean and look appeal i was excit 

i order the tritip sandwich with bbq sauc that i had to walk back up to get later sweet potato fri and a chocol shake no whip for that how i roll and the mrs went for the grill chicken salad

i ate what i could except for the big ol grizzli piec of hard sinew that was found in my sandwich i took it up to the counter to let them know and do i get a sorri or what can we do to make it better hell no the counter person just say ok what did i hear you right okay that it well fine i go to leav and as i turn at the door just in time to wit the counter girl show the piec i left with her to her store manag and they both give me an evil look as i exit

okay no it not okay i want someon just to say were sorri they obvious are not you just lost a custom for life and ill make it a habit never to return

eek methink not i wish you luck with serv sublevel product to the masssaw a buddi check in here and decid to give it a shot

went with the combo a 1175 2 fish catfish 7 oyster and two side the oyster were a bit saltybrini not fresh and the catfish didnt impress everyth look and tast like they use the same batter and seasoningjust ok overal  i wouldnt say it was horriblebut it wasnt good either  i did enjoy the hushpuppi though

th food took surpris long to get to our tablewhich is kind of a good thing  id rather it be cookedfri up fresh but we were the onli one in heredoesnt take that long to fri up food  

now for the bad

peach cobbler 199 this was not goodit was not even hot i am pretti sure this was cook the day befor left in the fridg and put in the microwaveand still wasnt heat up thorough eva end up get sick right at the tabl  not sure if it was due to the green bean i didnt eat those or the cobbler not work with her

if you cant keep it fresh or do it right keep it off the menu

i read anoth review where they state their fri were microwavedi would have turn it away and ask for a refund at that point  at least it was onli the dessert and green bean that were microwav for us

good luckand listen up for your microwav food to beepi am stun by the high rate of this place my friend and i came here for a late dinner on friday night we were seat after about 10 min we had a larg group of about 12 peopl the restaur was pretti empti we got a realli big tabl the dine room look realli neat our waitress greet us nice she show us how to use the drink menu  they had a realli cool select of drink they were innov but pricey i got the rum cocktail forgot the name it was realli good the drink was strong but the flavor was realli great

w order quit a few thing from the menu the food took forev they mess up on 14th of our order it was just one hot mess the food was not worth the wait by the time our food came everyon was in a bad mood the food was not aw but not great either the kitchen need to pay a littl more attent to what theyr do it made no sens to us whi they were mess up so bad on a slow day leav bit of  duck bone in the duck lettuc wrap is a big nono the experi left us with veri littl to smile about 

the onli dish that i was realli impress with was the green tea panna cotta it was such a great refresh dessert i love the textur of the top and the li hing mui work so well with the matcha flavor this is probabl the onli thing id recommend at the rx boiler room 

it realli suck that we had to pay a huge gratuiti bc of the size of the parti the servic just turn aw by the end of our night we were clear frustrat and the staff didnt handl this frustrat veri well they look just as piss off at us as we were at them they offer noth to appeas us instead some of my veri frustrat friend had to ask them if they were go to do anyth about what happen they brought out like half a dozen of small cooki but it just felt realli forc and a littl too late everyon in our parti left in a foul mood that night it realli put a damper on the start of our vega trip

definit not come back here there is no shortag of amaz food in vega rx boiler room need to step it up or els theyll be off the strip in no timescumbag move of the day goe to jimmi john store 2311 9985 s eastern ave 100 ivica and i left the offic to grab a coupl sandwich where there was a homeless teenag kid with a tini dog stand outsid under the overhang sinc it rain heavili today kid wasnt even ask for money grant there was a sign on his suitcas that said anyth will help well befor i could buy the poor kid a sandwich they had call henderson pd on him which if anyon know these cop theyd probabl arrest him and hed never see his dog again fortun i dont think they found him bottom line  your a collect of low life scumbag and ill be damn if you ever get ani of my or my compani busi ever againyes the new vee quiva casino has a buffet  yes it one star at least for right now

thi new cafebuffet open on juli 2nd  this is juli 5th so theyv had four day to iron out the problem associ with a new open  with that in mind i stop in here to enjoy some nice buffet today at around 1130 am  the hostess gave me a pager  said it would be about 15 minut which seem odd sinc the restaur was onli about 13 full

aft wait half an hour  be told that i was 4 on the list and that it would be a while longer i gave up  left  anoth weird thing was that i was told to stay with my pager within 20 feet of the front of the restaur or i would be out of rang  what the point of the pager

ther is absolut no excus for ani restaur to be off to such a pisspoor start especi by the fourth day

thi breakfast buffet serv from 6 am to 2 pm is also price way too high at 1095  consid what they had out today it should cost about half that

on star all around     osterl spoon cafe what doe that mean

definit of sterl n
bing dictionary
british currenc the currenc in pound and penc use in the unit kingdom
of sterl silver made of sterl silver
admir admir or valuable

just want to make sure the definit i know did not chang they sure as hell dont do british currenc unlik the definit this place is not admir or valuabl yes they have certain meal deal that are good and cheap but the servic or lack there of complet cancel out ani special they might have i havnt even mention what i end up get and it was not good at all

so i get my player card downstair and proceed to go up the escal toward the cafe wait time to sit down was about 10 minut which was not bad at all

unfortun everyth went downhil from there 

after get our drink from the drink person we all knew what we want to get alreadi without even have to look at the menu after about 15 minut our server final got around to take our order origin  i want to get the half rack of rib and 10 hot wing for 777 deal with player card but the ladi said that was over and it was now steak n egg for 999 that stupid becaus just earlier one of my friend said that they saw the 777 deal advertis on one of the cab even still she would not honor it and act like we were wast her time it was obvious that she did not like her job the bad vibe i was get from her almost made me want to get up and leav 

so i order the prime rib special for 999 sinc i saw somebodi receiv their order earlier from that point on it seem forev for our order to come out when i got my order it look decent to begin with but when i took my first bite the meat was bland and luke warm like it had been sit out dip it in the au jus that came with it help a littl the onion ring that came with it were alreadi soggi how doe that happen when she just brought it out the mash potato tast like card board fail

besid the bad servic and bad food the main thing that realli bother me was the smoke factor the whole time we were there in the cafe all we smell was cigarett smoke like a whole group of peopl were sit next to us smoke one cigarett after another

in close to reiter my experi in a nut shell bad food bad servic bad ventil and just overal failur in ambienc i am definit not come back here no matter what food deal they have for get treat poor and the possiblil of get lung cancer 

yelp 2014 365 review challeng 138 walk in healthi and hungri walk out with lung cancer and that unsatisfi feel in your stomachwith all the rave review and our previous fivestar experi at akira back yellowtail at the bellagio we had high hope for our dinner at kumi on saturday night we had reserv for 845 pm after the michael jackson one 7 pm show see separ review and we arriv prompt at 845 pm we were told by a veri sweet hostess that they were run behind and we would be seat within ten minut  that should have been a warn for what was to come 

as request on open tabl we were seat at a semicircular booth in the back room or upstair as the hostess refer to it it could be an incred room except that the light is so dim you cant read the menu thank heaven we had read the menu and alreadi knew what we want to order it was quit disconcert that we were ask by two differ waiter what we want to order for drink and then we were ask again by two waiter what we want to order to start the waiter were initi friend but then they seem to be rush us    and that was strang becaus the room was not even remot fill with diner at that point  mayb they were play catch up as the hostess did say they were run behind when we arriv  for a new restaur they should have spent a littl more time explain the menu make suggest etc 

we order in stage so that all the food didnt arriv at onc we start with the japanes eggplant    one japanes eggplant cut in half    delici but not worth the 12 price tag  we follow that with the miso black cod now this is one of our favorit dish and we have had this at some of the best restaur in las vega most notabl nobu and my husband and i both agre that nobu has the best around id put kumi close to the middl of the pack not just for it tast but also it valu at 29 then i thought about the portion and tast of the chilean sea bass i had the previous even at mastro ocean club 45 for a huge piec with the price we paid  for the black cod similar price fish and we felt rook  we took the advic of previous review and had the hot mess roll and the 007 octopussi both were tasti but we have had much better roll at social hous and by the way good luck see what you order in the dim lit room  i had to take a pictur with my iphon flash on to see how the plate was presented

th straw that broke the camel back was that we ultim wait over 30 minut to get our check we want to sign to our room at bellagio and appar accord to our waiter their system was down he came back to inform us that his manag would be take care of it short fifteen minut later we receiv our check and it was inaccur so back it went our server look ever so stress out came over to say they were still experienc issu and that a manag would again be take care of thing  twenti minut later the manag came over with our check he did not apolog for the wait or that the check was wrong    he just walk off  at that point my husband gave me the bill and told me that he could not bare to fill it out and said you do it  neither of us were sure if it was the waiter or the manag who was at fault but i call the manag over again and explain that we were quit shock that the servic was so poor he said he didnt understand and as i explain that we wait so long for the check he said ill have a talk with my server i wasnt awar of it  the end 

needless to say i have noth posit to say about our experi at kumi i guess if you are stuck at mandalay bay and have a hanker for japanes then you might choos kumi but if you arent there are so mani better place    includ shef akira back other note restaur yellowtailnever got to the pizza most bizarr of busi practic call to order a pizza for carryout i never had a chanc to ask the size of the pizza never had an opportun to place my order i ask to place a take out order after a brief hold im told no take out til 9 pm but they could seat me right away without think i said wed tri anoth time  the call end then i had a mental doubletak i can come in get seat  have a pizza place in front of me but they cant put that pizza in a box for take out i call back question if i understood correct  appar i had so im offer you know confus our first week we can actual do it becaus im told were empti right now what have i lost my friggin mind im told the first few night were slam understand  the kitchen still tri to figur out what they can handl so on so forth excus for sure i mean i understand the call taker was tri to make thing right but refus busi when your empti that not even a first week error it just absolut contrari to the point of busi isnt part of a pizzeria busi take out admit the error apolog  spare me the excus excus kill my appetit to be honest becaus excus leav a bad tast have work in the servic industri for over 10 year the busi problem like overwhelm your kitchen capacityovers the room are of no concern to the custom a custom want good food but more import good servic i had neither 

you know few year ago i purchas an ak47 from grampa in the same spot grampa pizzeria now occupi i couldnt help but chuckl when it occur to me it was easier to buy an assault rifl from grampa gun shop than it is to get a pizza for carryout from grampa pizzeria so so weird anyhow ill probabl give anoth chanc at some point but i couldnt let this one slideif tobi keith is affili with this place in ani way he should be embarrass with the piss poor servic they provid i should have listen to my fellow yelper on this one i sat at the bar for 10 minut befor i flag down help it felt like i was broken down in the side of the road await a tow truck anyway the bartend explain they were not cover that side of the bar as well ok so i just move to the other side the same thing happen no one approach me my guest show up and ask for a manag some man with a porno mustach show up and said he  laugh and said he would disciplin them after 2am not sure but it seem inappropri sinc the waitress were veri pretti the waitress went on to say the restaur was fair new howev this was custom servic 101 stuff
i will never return an neither should youthis place had potenti  the atmospher and music are pretti good  unfortun the bouncer are a bunch of absolut tool bag  my cousin got approach at a tabl and ask to show his id  he had shown it at the front door   he was then ask to step outsid so they could check and see if he was intox  first he wasnt  1 beer second he was mind his own busi  the bar was spars pack  we were talk amongst our own group  the onli thing i can think of is they didnt like his shoe  nike orthey are prejudic  a fat bouncer with a beard approach him and start harass him out of the blue  they said he could reenter when it becam clear he was not intox and he would most like sue if they continu to harass him  he is a busi profession  we end up leav  for the night but will not spend our money in a place with douch bag for bounceri am not sure what all of the hype is about this restaur but my experi was not so pleasant i hate to post negat review and i onli do when a restaur can be spectacular and miss the mark by mile 

i came in for lunch with my brother and sat at the bar i was pretti specif about the order and it seem the kitchen did not understand the assign i order the greek burger on wheat hold the arugula and add romain lettuc meal come out on the egg bun no lettuc it was taken back to have romain ad and replac the bun and instead of romain which i know they have becaus they serv caesar salad it come out with red limp lettuc upon take a bite of the burger i see that the insid is complet underdon obvious at this point im over it 

the restaur had more staff than patron so im unsur how detail are overlook the bartend was nice howev she did not write anyth down and lack the abil to rememb and had to ask three time what the specif were 

mi brother also had a burger the tradit one with onli ketchup and mustard appar it was too much of a chore to put it on the burger and it came out plain 

i want a burger so bad this day and normal i go to habit burger and their burger are perfect alway consist perfect servic hot meat and chees super cold veggi and no matter what i chang they alway get it right it is probabl half the cost also i chose to tri someth new and my level of disappoint could not be greater 

the build out was nice but the food was unabl to match the decor i am sure the concept is good i heard who the own partner are and they alway have great restaur so i am a bit shock i was so disappoint 

typic in the establish i dine in when there is a disappoint custom some form of manag come out to ask about the experi get detail so they can address the kitchen appropri not one person came out to inquir 

word of advic manag should alway come out and find out what happen so this can be rectifi second if you are go to call yourself a burger bar and offer all of the option shown on the menu the kitchen should be abl to understand and prepar the order as if they order it and a temperatur should alway be requestit was our first time come here and what a horribl experi it wasw read posit yelp review so we thought we would give this place a tri bad mistak 

walk in with my girlfriend hope to enjoy a nice meal here but when we pass through the door no one help us the worker were busi talk to their friend there were what appear to be around 10 colleg student includ one of the worker play a trade card game serious they look too old to be play pokemon card we end up go to japanes curri zen right across the street instead

locat in the mgm near the main elev off the lobbi and receiv mix review from person i trust i decid to take it upon myself to decid whether corner cake was simpli anoth overpr casino money grab or perhap a hidden gem like the donut counter at america restaur in nynyth result lean so far to the former that i liter left 12 of bake good in a trashcan notfar from the small smoki loung where i sat to indulg  note first that each of the pastri are inde attract present while the staff is smiley pleasant and effici even given the area immens foot traffic it is here that the posit of corner cake end  the old adag about put lipstick on a pig rare as true as a 5 dens cakey and flaccid almond croissant to start the tast off poor and thing onli to get wors as i progress to a cronut so oili that it liter could have been wrung out with the excess oil use to fri up anoth better version anywher els in town  assum that perhap lamin andor french pastri simpli isnt where corner cake shine it was next with halfheart enthusiasm that i proceed onward to a duo of actual cake and while the individu carrot cake was actual quit decent a dens crumb with plenti of spice to balanc sweet buttercream the red velvet cupcak manag the seem imposs feat of be near ined the cake itself tasteless around a near solid chocol core while the chalki chilli frost seem to be channel sour cream moreso than cream chees  the question fresh and halffrozen present make me wonder whether the cupcak was even bake on premisesand if so whendont wast your time we came here tri to get a quick bite to eat after a concert and we wait what seem like sever minut up front despit there were onli two tabl of custom in the whole restaur final the hostess show up with no apolog a look of distast on her face and i know they knew we were there becaus the door chime in the back for them to know they have custom in front but i gave her my two cent befor i left out the door to go to denni instead did we realli expect good servic after that i think notyou know how they say dont knock it until you tri it well they also say trust your gut instinct first intuit  or someth like that i was excit when i first notic that tonkatsu kiyoshi was open up i wasnt so excit when i saw their menu and price onlin and had no desir to go one day i was drive around and crave someth katsu with so mani option for katsu i decid to final give these guy a shot sinc most review sound like i was lose out on someth good 

after enter i squint my eye and saw a nicer look rice trax the busi this locat was previous known for and took a seat at the counter and start to realli look at the menu still veri pricey for katsu i dunno i had the pork katsu with egg and rice it was by far the worst thing ive ever eaten i couldnt finish half the littl bowl and actual vomit it out when i went back to work it tast spoil or just had a veri differ tast than what id expect it was funni tast 

probabl the onli posit thing i like about the place nice present decor on the tabl your suppos to grind up sesam seed and add sauc to make your own katsu sauc which was interest i had to ask what that caus i dont eat at katsu hous im sure i wasnt the onli one a littl more custom servic would be nice i realli felt like they just want my money surpris theyr from hawaii when i was done i walk to the door paus wait a second for a thank you that didnt come and left remov anoth bookmark for a busi id never be back to anytim soon

mayb it was a bad dayi found a dead cockroach in my egg roll i  just couldnt believ my eye when i saw itaft ccomplain to  the manag he was veri apologet but at that point i was so traumat that i just storm out of the the restaur avoid at all costdisappoint i didnt go to a true dim sum restaur on spring mountain  like other yelper i thought id give this new place a shot i was first excit about a dim sum place close to our vega hous but then i was let down when i saw the menu their name dim sum cafe impli that they know what dim sum isbut this place has littl idea what they are do  the serv staff is predomin nonasian and had no clue what cheong fun noodl and tradit dim sum fare are  i explain what i was look for beef cheong fun and the server said they have it when the dish arriv it was beef noodl stir fri not even close to the flat rice noodl fill with beef pork or shrimp  i order 2 and those plate never touch my tabl i sent them back as soon as i saw them it like i went to a socal hamburg stand and they had no clue what a cheeseburg is gawd it took a while for them to figur out we need plate and i guess they didnt have chopstick readi  

425 eggrol 2 piec you think it would be good or larg for the money right wrong it seem like they just fri some eggrol from ranch 99 and charg 2 a piec super ripoff becaus the eggrol was not veri tasti ad insult to injuri my kid order a grill chees sandwich and they didnt have cheddar chees so she got a grill mozerella sandwich yuck 

confus menu small dim sum collect american breakfast of oatmeal waffl french toast salad spaghetti and fish 

wait staff was slow to figur out we need place set and our server acknowledg that they were have mani custom complain about the menu restaur was clean it 2 week new and the tvs on the wall still had the energi consumpt sticker on them no fish in the tank yet either 

i hope these review serv as a wakeup call to the owner vega is not the kind of place that support or toler a bad restaur especi one that leav custom feel trick and overcharg i would love to pay good money for good food but this place is like it indoor wooden trelli the structur is there but it isnt polish and leav peopl ask the question whi  id skip this place until they get mani of the wrinkl iron out  hope they do it soon befor the grand open turn into the grand closefirst off let me say that this busi is notori for send hate mail when the reviewercustom doe not rate this place high  now let me save you the troubl by say that i will not read hate mail so dont bother as i am sure you will also not bother in make ani necessari chang for all patron to be fulli satisfi when dine here  

we came here on a saturday even and it was complet dead which was the first red flag  we had heard good thing by a few peep so we decid to give it a go  

we start with a few skewer and a kama  or i should say half of a kama which were all crowd all on the same plate thrown over a bed of cabbag accompani by an overpow smelli orang slice awe 

everyth we order look noth like the pictur we saw on yelp no wonder they frown on pictur taking

so disappoint that i stop at the second order and could not go on  it get wors the sushi chef also kept shake his head no on certain item suggest they were not of good qualiti i notic that my husband kept order other item as if tri to convinc himself that it couldnt get worsebut that all they serv here and he soon realiz they just could not be save  they also do not offer half roll and offer 1 dessert per person and with too mani restrict at an all you can eat joint make for a veri unfun experi all togeth 

there is just way too much competit out there and you unfortun onli have in mani case one attempt to caus a good first impress with me
good luckafter have such a miser experi i feel social oblig to post this review no later than 30 minut after eat at ocarnivor so that other do not suffer the same fate as myself

in no particular order let count some way that make this place the worst attempt to copi chipotl ever

1 they were out of pico de gallo
2 they were out of lettuce
3 the food server pick the salsa and sour cream bottl out of a contain with melt ice and the water from the bottl drip all in the burrito and rice bowl as the item were poured
4 the food server continu touch the tortilla to her filthi shirt as she made the burrito
5 the food tast stale and the salsa was not good
6 the bowl was almost the same price as chipotl yet it was half the size
7 there werent ani other custom and the server stare at me while i ate and
8 they didnt have ani type of sign for visibility

a 9 meal for two groupon brought me here  the pictur were grossli misrepres on groupon

without a doubt save your time and money and avoid this place like the plagu  some busi truli deserv to fail and this is one of themi dont know what wors the drink or the fat girl serv it mayb both 
notbless daddyissui am a vig brand super fan great food drink peopl so this break my heart 

the white trashass smoke allow on the patio ruin this place it occur to me they might allow smoke on at the arcadia vig which allow explain whi i live at uptown 

smoke is so fuck gross it make your food gross it make your drink gross it make the experi gross for exampl the smoker next to me are talk about how they pee between each other leg when one is sit on the toilet and one is stand and also about how when her boyfriend recent insert a tampon in her vagina he ask where their relationship could go from there i hope theyr happi 

also ive now been here approach 20 mother fuck minut and have yet to be approach by an employe embarrassi thought pink box doughnut i do like the fat elvi at pink box was rate too high but this place take the cake errr donut pick out a half dozen donut and cronut my wife cut the cronut in half for us to split and it was damn sweet eat one of the ice cronut from here will send you straight to the dentist the appl fill donut was pretti good and the sugar twist was too the rest of the donut were just way to sugari and sweet they remind me of donut from winchel except these were wors the ladi behind the counter was nice and insid was clean but i cant see come back not one of the donut were finish that we got and that is a rariti in my hous with the garbag i eatprobabl should give this one star but cant bring myself to go that low

 huge buffet that is laid out so as to allow for plenti of room to maneuver
 buffet was kept well stock  noth was ever low or empty
 staff was veri friend and veri prompt with clear plate and get refills

 the food the major of it here why

 the sushi roll were laden with crablikeslaw everi roll had a healthi dollop of it
 each piec of sushi i tri was warmtohot this scare me
 the roll were cover in various sauc  id rather they featur the fish than some cheap mayobas sauce
 the tuna nigri was dri and also warm
 the salmon nigri was veri hard to chew and was warm to the touch

 the general tsos chicken tast quit odd not anyth like what ive had before
 broccoli and chicken was bare lukewarm chicken was decent but flavorless
 egg roll were veri crispi but ill be darn if i could tell what they were fill with

 potstick were toler wish they had littl bowl for the sauce

so im pretti sure i wont be back the valu of an inexpens buffet isnt worth the lotterylikequality

upd 24 hour later i experienc some serious discomfort in the ole digest tract later in the even and through part of the next day i suspect the lack of proper food storag temperatur may have play a role i would urg journey to check the temperatur of all of their food  sushi roll should not be lukewarm and hot dish should be hotit with a heavi heart that i bring you this review of the oncebelov bombay spice your dead to me now 

i was a huge fan and frequent diner at the old locat i love bring friend there and my husband and i enjoy the wednesday date night special on more than one occas unfortun those are just memori 

there is no way i would go here to enjoy a glass of wine and samosa or curri 

this new locat look like a crappi diner and the chipotl style order line just miss the mark the server liter just dump food into the togo contain and man the till   the food qualiti and quantiti has plummetednot to mention the lost appeal of fresh food i have some friend who eat a vegan diet and they appreci the abil to request modif to their meal not such ani more  the lentil soup was reminisc of the old recip but came with about three bite and was bland overal  

rip bombay of oldi notic that this place open recent and want to give them a chancebig mistake

look promis at first there were 4 peopl ahead of me in line when i got there menus are print in color on nice paper they dont have it display on the wall decid to go with the orang chicken lunch special sinc the price wasnt too bad 595 i also order the veget egg roll i was go to tri one of their smoothi but they didnt look veri good in those machin like they werent mix veri well i paid for my order and they told me it would be a 10 minut wait no problem sinc they were cook everyth fresh i think

took it home and was pretti disappoint the orang chicken was bland and the sauc seem chunki like it was old or someth you know it bad when panda express serv better orang chicken the egg roll werent veri good either they were hot and crispi but bland as well even with the sweet and sour sauc again you know it bad when panda express has better egg rolls

stay away unless you are ok with tasteless chines foodhavent even eaten here yet and alreadi ive had a bad experi 

decor not muchit almost like it tri to be someth in seattl pike place market 

servic when it slow like the first night i was there the chef talk to us and inform us vegan option would be avail dure the weekend the place didnt have menuscustom have taken them
i return on the weekend for the market and stop by again while wait a ladi line up behind me and the chef by pass me to take the ladi order behind me 
while wit this anoth ladi in front of me ask for protein option the chef then tell her you name it we got it not even a question like what kind of protein are you look for
fin i get up to order and she then tell me monday ill have the ordersuppli in to make vegan crepe okay ill wait till monday
i call befor i go over and shes not even sure if she has vegan item to make a crepetuesday my supplier will be here with the vegan batchesso you dont make the batch yourself yet charg a ridicul price cmon 

this place will never see my busi seem like a great idea probabl jump in a bit earli 

tip to the owner
mak a perman menu and have more knowledg on your inventoriif there were a prize for worst of las vega this restaur would win first place it would also win worst place for servic food qualiti and wait time you can wait more than 30 min for the worst crepe that you could ever eat
p if you write them on yelp what you think of their busi they will rude repli wtfchef agn is a micromanag and made order a truli unnecessari pain in the ass 

i hadnt heard anyth good about this place but when my 10 year old cousin ask for a smoothi i couldnt say no after all how hard could it be to order a smoothi togo annoy difficult apparently

w walk in with my corgi in tow know the market is pet friend plus we were just walk up to the regist to order and wait for it outsid i ask the man at the regist if we could order a smoothi togo and he explain it would be about 510 min okay no problem just as i was about to hand over my card chef agn got in my face say there a tabl outsid have a seat we cant allow dog in here food will take about 25 min 

1 get out of my face
2 were not stay for a sit down meal
3 there are a coupl dog in here right now

i told her we were just order a smoothi togo and she said yes still 25 min ha who the hell is go to wait that long for a smoothi plus your cashier told me 510

we walk out i sat my cousin on a bench with my corgi and went back in to order mind you now im in the back of the line again i get to the regist order the smoothi and the guy look at me like didnt you order helloooooooo where have you been i was go to pay you until the crazi ladi got all up in my face i was go to excus his obvious lack of knowledg with the regist dure our first exchang but now it clear you all have no idea what your do one berri smoothi to go that it he ask what size and befor he can get back with the cup to show me the two size they have here come chef agn again ask him if hes know someon at the regist duh ladi let him do his job someon has control issues

terri thought everyon opinion made this a safe place to live it up wrong
 didnt tri the food thank god as the small hous payment for two coffe smaller than a senior cup at mcdonald was horrifi enough
 as we wait for our coffe everi employe in the place approach us at least twice to tri to seat us not in a solicit way more of a creepi boss stalker way
 wouldnt go back for a free crepe luckili i dont think they would offer a crepe is probabl more cost than most vacations
 it tast ok but was 9 for what was serious less than 12 cup total coffe in two cups
 even the server apolog that my tini cup was most empti i think cocain us cheaperim give it one star and that becaus the wing were actual delici 

the reason for my bad review is simpl the custom servic suck the guy at the regist was appar have a bad day lemm rephras that bad life attitud from the start i ask how big the wing were and the guy act like i was ask for a free sampl then when i ask to mix and match i ask if i could have 4 wing in a separ sauc and he snap at me we onli do in 5s like if i alreadi knew

al in all the wing were realli good i got the jerk sauc and can honest say it was veri pleasing

w heaven need to send their employe to a learn some manner if you dont want to deal with peopl get out of the food servic industri 

i hate to write bad review but this guy realli made my first experi at wing heaven a bad experi at least the wing were goodi realli hate write bad review for small businessesesp one in my neighborhood  

not that our opinion is life chang or anyth dramat it just that i realli have high hope for small busi realli want to find the diamond in the roughth place no one els has realli discov yet

it took me week to decid whether i was actual go to post my reviewwel here it is 

cant come to a place call wing heaven and not tri the wing first right

i tri the 10 wing meal 1249 spici garlic honey heaven and a 12lb fri the flavor were just oki did like how crunchi the outsid were though  

the owner presum mention that they marinatebatt the wing twice befor the fryer and after so they get extra crispi and a bit more flavor  i wasnt overwhelm with the food flavor though

but the reason the review is so low was the fact that my chicken wing were not fulli cooked

i bit into the first one or two and notic they were a littl pink on the insid  noth horribl like blood or super raw just a bit pink  just enough to worri a bit but my iron stomach was tell me that i would be ok eat a littl bit of the less pink ones

i start rip them apart and they were all pretti much the same  i ate up the wing that i thought were more cook but i end up get sick afterward  and for the next 2 days

i am sure i could have went back into the store and ask for him to cook me a new set  i am sure the custom servic would have been great and it would have been done with no issues

but i didnt do thatand i got sickso we are both to blamewe visit the new locat tonight for a late dinner after order and pay one of the line cook made derogatori remark in spanish about my boyfriend and myself we were the onli patron in the restaur so it was clear the comment were about us whether he thought we didnt speak spanish or thought we couldnt hear him it was complet unaccept in 2014 to be such a hate homophob ass we immedi ask for a refund and left without eati hate deal with this locat theyr slow as hell and rude everi time i place a call for a pickup there alway a 3 hour wait for pickup and when you go into the actual locat for a sit down dinner youll spend 3 hour wait to be seat and for your food to arriv also note the staff isnt as knowledg about the menu as some of the other locat so you may find yourself tell them about thing on the menu

i question them about this long wait and was told it becaus theyr the onli locat on the west sidewel the 10th st  camelback locat has been cater to the entir central phoenix area for year with no issu and the manag just look at me

sav yourself the troubl and call the 10th street  camelback locati would give this locat negat star if i could due to it poor servic and even wors manag best part is when you email the oregano custom servic you receiv no respons 

call in a pizza at 430pm and was told it would not be readi until 730pm this is ridicul but it work on that day sinc im not 100 year old and do not eat at 430pm that be said i arriv to pick up my pizza and they never took my order wtf then i have some 17 year old staff member ask me if i call the right locat realli my respons was well is this 67th ave and bell rd then i guess i call the right fuke place 

the manag came over and state that they had good news and bad news i told him i alreadi knew the bad news and that i didnt want to hear anymor he state that they were make my stuf crust pizza right now and that it would onli take 15 minut to get it readi so i thought to myself either they stole someon els pizza or my pizza will not be cook all the way sure enough receiv my pizza and it was way under cook to the point where the dough was still raw that right i said it raw


i email oregano corpor and receiv now respons which is pretti profession in my opinion i think it was the fact that i told them their organ at this locat is crap and that after month of be open the manag staff should have these issu resolv well guess what these issu remain they are slow rude veri unorgan and the manag team look to be as if they have absolut no idea what they are do 

it sad realli i am sure mark russel did not build his empir on idiot howev after deal with this locat on sever occas i question that so the moral of the stori is if you want to open a compani and be extrem success do the first coupl of locat flawless then lower your standard to have subpar employe at the rest of the locat as an owner this will put more money in your pocket even at the expens of your custom the sad thing is most peopl will deal with these issu becaus the food is so good most of the time

nikoim review this place now but i ate there quit a while ago when they open i dont rememb everyth specif in detail but ill give it my best we wait to get in then they let us know that the pizza would be a while to cook so get it right the first time right it was me and some famili we all final agre on a pizza and order some appet and i think a pasta to split up the pizza we got after our long wait was a deep dish with chees and pepperoncini a plethora of pepperoncini not what we order from what i rememb the waitress mess up a coupl of other thing and forgot the pasta horribl we didnt see her for a while after the pizza came so i flag down anoth waitress when we realiz it had the wrong top i ask the other much more assert seem waitress to grab a manag for me she was veri friend and got her over there right away i dont rememb much but i do rememb explain the situat to her and her exact word were well what do you want me to do about it i was so shock to have a manag ask me how i plan to solv the issu that i couldnt even answer after i stutter for a second she said i could make you anoth pizza or i dont know keep in mind me and my fam wait to get in the restaur and then order and wait anoth 4560 minut to get the pizza i was not satisfi with her manageri skill 

as it was approach close time we are still wait for our pizza and i was get weird look from the server and the manag a polic offic come in not to eat he is just talk to the manag and stand there with her short after he arriv the pizza come to the tabl by this time nobodi want ani mayb we fill up with appet and the pasta that final came but here the weird part i cant help but wonder if the manag call the polic becaus of me it sure seem like it the polic offic left right after we did mayb you had to be there either way as a custom i just didnt feel comfort and i didnt enjoy my time there at the establish it a shame too becaus my sister was rave about the other oregano locat the pizza when we final got it was much better than it pepperoncini fill counter part 

i hope they got it togeth by now but what i experienc was unacceptst patrick day and after a day of work and night at the gym i want to go out and get an order of corn beef  cabbag and a guin after two fail attempt at other establish one 10 per person to get in and the second close the kitchen at 8 i call obrien i was impress that they answer the phone it sound quiet in the background and their kitchen was open until 12 

it is right behind the fiesta mall and had plenti of park when i walk in it was spacious and although there were sever peopl it was not too busi  and it was quiet we sat down at 920 in the bar area there was a guy clean tabl besid us and two server that walk by multipl time the hostess came in gave someon a menu and left we still wait 

i look at everyon as they wait on surround tabl or walk by yet we went unacknowledg i stop someon and ask if we could get a minut we final receiv one and it was some minut befor the server came to our tabl when she did she said oh wait  let me get some paper to write down your order she return quick and wrote down the corn beef  cabbag a guin and lemonad 

we wait and wait and wait some more i was grow increas impati i saw her occasion walk around yet we still had no drink 15 minut 20 minut 30 minut still no drink i understand the food would take longer but the drink i look at their clock and it said 857 i stop a differ server walk by told her i was five minut from walk out she ask whi and i inform her we still didnt have drink 

a guy came up apolog and i said whatev  i am leav in three minut he ask what we order i said appar a time consum lemonad and guin becaus we cant seem to get one in under a half hour he look shock and ask what food we order he apolog and said he would check on it i remind him he was down to two minut and i didnt care what he did with it 

he did hustl and brought the lemonad and guin and apolog then he went into the back and immedi return with a plate of corn beef and cabbag we had also at some point ad mozzarella stick and he return a coupl of minut later with those our origin server came by and she said oh sorri and ask if she could get anyth els for us i said how about a second set of silverwar she said okay but we never did see that surfac 

anoth server stop by apolog and said there have been a lot of mixup tonight she said the manag would stop by and talk to us but he was with someon els right now the help male server stop by again to see if we need anyth and the manag show up at the same time he drop off anoth guin and lemonad that must have been from the kid menu i told him i didnt think i would drink that other beer he said tri then he walk the male server to the side and ask where we came frommean whose tabl did he take over then he said someth about take the food and someon had been wait for someth for a long time  it sound like he was get in troubl for help out mayb he took someon els food i dont know what their stori was and sorri i we ate your food 

the manag never did speak to us other than give us the free drink we didnt want they did not take anyth off the bill  the corn beef the chees stick lemonad and guin came to 2645 we also never receiv the second set of silverwar 

i understand it is st patrick day and most place are crazi busi this was not that busi and had suffici staff coverag for an irish bar this is your black friday you have one day that you are realli busi and need to be at the top of your game this was far from it the food was good but the servic except for the one guy who eventu got talk to was horribl it was slow and i was get annoy befor it realli was slow and i was annoy it should not take that long to get a menu and then drink should be immedi  not 40 minut 

i appreci the server who tri to help even if he got in troubl even though the food was good i will never go back to that busi if someon were to take my dead bodi and put it in the restaur i would turn into a zombi if noth more than to walk out of thereup until today my experi with this sushi restaur has been great their restaur is clean the food is good and it a quiet littl nook off of the fast pace street of down town scottsdal  i like the place so much i would make an effort to go at least onc a week with my cowork unfortun i state like in past tens due to a terribl custom experi with one of their wait staff today 

have eaten at the place 4 or 5 time i was shock to be confront by my usual waiter for suppos short chang her 3 on a bill from 3 week ago 

instead of explain the situat the woman accus me of purpos stif her on the bill and leav short after so she had to pay the 3 out of her own pocket without give me the opportun to inquir further she storm off to the back of the room  the weird part of this incid is that she was referenc a bill from 3 week prior to my current dine experi with them which mean i had eaten there at least onc or twice sinc the suppos dine and ditch situat had occur 

when anoth waiter  also her manag and the owner came by  instead of take over where she left to ask us if there was an issu he act like noth had happen and ask for our order shock at the outburst and accus we order without comment  when she came by again i ask if she could provid a receipt  that way i could see the total amount paid and due as proof of short chang her she respond that they were unabl to pull up our previous bill though they admit to serv me sinc then but didnt bring it up until now 

what am i miss someth here

regardless i took her word for it and i attempt to remedi the situat by pull 5 out of my wallet and offer my condol   when i tri to give her the money she proceed to get huffi and stomp off say it was 3 week ago so it doesnt matter 

if it didnt matter whi bring it up  it 3 

have discuss the whole incid with my cowork sever time i decid to write this review as a warn to ani futur custom that may want to check in to this place i was onc a repeat custom but after today on principl alon i wont return the whole thing is actual laughable

1st if i want to stiff her whi would i pay 96 of the bill 

2nd if that was in fact the case you would and should have been abl to pull up the bill prove that the custom didnt pay in full 

3rd the manner in which it was brought to our attent was shock whi would you accus a repeat custom whose eaten at your restaur at least twice sinc the incid of stif you on the bill but not bring it up until 3 week later that make no sens in fact it sound like she may have gotten the wrong peopl 

4th  all of this over 3 if your that hard up on  it probabl a good idea to treat your custom with respect and approach them with ani situat calm not let your bratti employe ruin ani chanc of retain a onc loyal custom  hope the extra 5 make your day sweet heart  life to short to freak out over 3 buck 

luckili i pass 4 other sushi restaur on the way to get to their place go forward ill go to a closer stop that doesnt freak out on their custom and make a scene  the sad part is this whole situat could have been avoid had it been approach sooner and with a civil attitud obvious i had no problem pay for the miss 3 sinc i in fact paid more than what i was accus of cheat her out of  more to the point though her manag didnt step in if the employe couldnt handl the situat appropri than the manag should have taken action and step in poor communic and tactic overal has earn this place a bad rate  01 if you want a cold beer  dont come

2 if you want good servic  you appar need to let them get established

3  if you want mediocr food that over price  your herelook no more

4  if you want anyth besid 3 beer or  hard alcohol  dont sit upstairs

w wait with our name on the list for upstair balconi  they didnt even care where we were  it was appar self sit  2 hour later  our waiter said he can get us hard alcohol but he would need to walk down the stair and was tire caus he had been walk them sinc 10am  we got our own drink  then the beer was warm  i got mud shark wheat beer and it was sour from be so warm  they have been open a week  how is it bad  caus they didnt proper setup anyth befor open  it is so mismanag it sad  we are realli excit about this place  horribl servic and beer  they are craft beer and food  our hostess acknowledg that they gave us a bad experi and said they would buy a round of drink for the four of us  nobodi did and we were so tire of the place we left and went to san tan breweri  a place that has good food and is manag proper  the place has a good atmospher but nobodi know what they are doi was realli look forward to this place open a coupl of month ago final a cool place to enjoy qualiti craft beer in chandler but im sad to say that this place keep disappoint over and over i keep tell myself that these poor custom servic incid were all circumstanti and isol occurr but they were not in fact it seem to be the trend 

this is the incid today that realli piss me off arriv at the perch around 530 the wait was about 45 min i total understand so my friend and i go to the bar area we stand in front of 23 bartend and no respons for 5 min so we said ok mayb well have better luck upstair we get upstair and it wasnt that busi at the bar there were 6 bar stool open we sit down hope to get the attent of the bartend there were 2 at the time we get no greet not even a look from these cool dude one of the bartend even wipe the bar in front of my buddi with no look or interact of ani sort shame on the perch so after about 12 min look like thirsti idiot we decid to go to santan breweri we had a much better experi and final a beer 

im a craft beer trader and i am alway at the local bar here in town sampl craft brew but i will never mention or support this place i would recommend hungri monk water hole san tan and wilder brew befor go to the perchhorribl brisket was so dri that it make memphi championship look moist by comparison rib were decent pull pork was subpar bake potato casserol was noth more than mash potato chees and green onion 

this is the kind of q you get when a franchise pay a corpor trainer to learn how to work a smoker it was a disast i would fire anyon who a didnt pay attent to the meat and let it dri out and b serv it anyway

if peopl pay good money and are actual happi with this qualiti of q then good barbecu would make their head explodlet me prefac this by say that i was rais on steak n shake and am from where it origin it been a famili institut for 8 decad my parent frequent the origin sns my grandpar frequent the origin sns  knew the belt famili for all the yelper out there i simpli ask that befor you write off steak n shake base on a signatur 12 store that is the temp locat pleas tri eat at an actual sitdown classic steak n shake restaur the signatur store is noth like the real deal no exagger 

on to the review

fin tri steak n shake in temp today verdict high disappoint order origin doubl chees w fri zero crispi edg on slight warm mushi burger zero crispi edg on a steak n shake origin burger crispi edg are a requir and wholli defin an origin steak n shake burger sinc 1934 goddammit limp tast overcook fri innout burger is multitud better than sns signatur and i dont even particular like innout a manag stop by  ask how thing were and i just told him as a guy whose famili is from normal illinoi weve been eat  steak n shake liter from day 1  for 80 year now  i wouldnt dream of bring them to this locat everyth was just off not a singl thing tast or feel familiar about this signatur locat it realli almost as if it not even affili with the regular restaur the two friend i brought with me today said theyll never go back i cant blame them the onli thing go for this locat is price contrast my temp experi with my most recent experi at real sns locat in austin tx last novemb  2012 in bloomington il pure joy everyth was as it shouldv been 

i simpli cant understand whi theyv chosen to roll these signatur store out itd be almost as if innout burger show up in peoria il  serv ham salad sandwich 

i think sns is do irrepar damag to their brand with these storei wish i could give this place zero stars

i return to sonic after my first review becaus i saw a bunch of peopl sit in the outdoor seat area and i thought mayb they got their act together

i went through the drivethru to get a larg cherrylimeadeprob the best thing sonic doe  i didnt order anyth els  that was allon larg cherrylimead  the dude on the drivethru mic ask me if i want to make a rout 44 size for ten cent more  i love a good upsel as much as anyonesold my friend

i pull forward and there was onli one car in line in front of me  it was park at the window  i pull up and waited

and waited

and waited

aft 5 minut i thought about pull away but figur id gut it out if for no other reason than this review

so i wait some more

and waited

and wait  

after thirteen minutesy 1 3 m i n u t e sthirteen long dull pointless minut where there was no interact at all at the window  two other car were stack up behind me i could tell from the bodi languag that the girl in the car in front of me were angry

fin someon show up at the window and start pass bag of food through to the two girl in front of me  it was at least six or seven bag and a fourcarri of shake  

im sorryif you have a larg drivethru order like that you pull the car to a park spot to wait  you dont make a dude wait thirteen minut for one freakin cherrylimead  that basic drivethru 101  if you cant get that simpl thing togeth your busi is screwed

i final get to the window and the dude at the window say you had three shake right

i said no a larg cherrylimeade

h turn to anoth guy  can i get a larg cherrylimead right away

seri  i wait thirteen freakin minut for a singl friggin drink and you dont even have it readi when i get there  oh screw you sonic of sun prairi  when your crappi restaur goe bellyup i will be there to danc in front of your for sale sign

thi place has been open for month there is no excus for incompet like this  

i final get my drinkmor than 15 minut after my initi order  fifteen minut for one larg drink folk  and they still charg me fullpric  and my rout 44 upsel was complet forgotten

if the owner of that sonic ever read yelp  hey dudesel out to someon who know what the they are do  run a fastfood restaur isnt hard i knowi did it for three year success mind you  your employe are lost your food is lack and sit in a drivethru for fifteen minut is unforgiv  even culver will burn peopl through in less than ten minutes

go away sonic  your bad at your jobthere no conceiv reason this place should still be in busi from my perspective
when a person walk into this near empti hous at noon on a saturday and is told you can sit at ani tabl that doesnt have a reserv sign and they all have reserv sign what do you do
i attempt to sit at the bar there were no stool 
i tri pull a coupl stool from an empti reserv tabl the bartend told me to put them back 

i then found a tabl in the corner with no reserv sign and prompt stake my claim
within second a server came rush over to tell us someon had onli moment befor call in to buy the tabl tell us they plan on a pack hous in a coupl of hour and they realli werent abl to serv us
can you fuck believ that
i still cant

i cant recal anytim in recent year where a busi ani busi has made me feel so unwelcom as did derbi public house

i will come back someday
but itll be to point and laugh as creditor respossess your bar furnish you gigant sack of assholfirst and last time 

this review is base on the south west of the border breakfast burrito such a disappoint i was told by the waitress this was a popular choic among the regular fals advertis 
the burrito contain accord to their menu jumbo flour tortilla chorizo egg chees grill onion season potato and salsa 
unfortun the chefown forgot to add the season potato salsa came on the side instead of insid which i specif ask for insid i didnt realli see or tast the chorizo and it didnt appear to be mix in with the egg unless the eggchorizo ratio wasnt proport i seen a few piec of grill onion after i open it up to uncov what realli insid the burrito 

in conclus the burrito was veri plain and ruin my appetit i left half the burrito on the plate despit my starvat 

suggest this is a must 
the chorizoegg ratio need to be proport it is call a south west of the border burrito for cri out loud all i tast was plain egg horribl 
dont forget the season potato how could u forget this im still bother by this 
add grill bell pepper  onion proportional
 pleas put the salsa insid the burrito not on the side unless the custom state otherwis 
home made salsa may be better choic over picant brand salsa 
795 is not reason price 595 if made correct  

i realli hate to write a negat review sorri i didnt tell you in person i was too upset 

pleas improv this burrito and allow it to live up to his name without ruin an appetit or moodgreat place for breakfast  everyth on the menu look good  i had the prime benni and it had to be one of the best egg benedict i have everi had  the hashbrown was also cook to perfect  the place is small but comfort  we did have to wait a bit for the food but it was worth it

th onli negat was that the worker seem to be bulli a new young waitress which made thing a bit awkward

upd to 1 star from 4  unfortun the owner are not good peopl  threaten litig and argu with custom will get you nowher in busiwell last night we decid to check this new place out just to see how it was for a saturday night in spring mnt it was terribl servic there was mayb 3 other tabl that were occupi with us and they still keep forget my order there were a few interest item in the menu but noth realli stand out and the tast were a littl bland the sashimi was pretti big than normal and fresh but the other sushi had a powderi tast to it so had to water it down just to get the tast out the place look realli nice and spacious insid mayb in a coupl of week we will come back to see if anyth chang 
for their grand open they should have advertis and did some kind of special to lure more custom in the storei was hope this place would be great order the bacon wrap date which i probabl wouldnt order again the chicken chorizo paella was terribl we took one bite  sent it back probabl the worst ive ever had sent it back  never had a manag come to the tabl our server was nice  it was obvious that she had just come back from a smoke break i dont have ani intent on go backi have no idea how this place is rank so high everyth that we order befor the main cours was blandsalad saffron chicken bacon wrap date calamari all had no tast the chicken tast like chicken soup base with boil chicken the worst offend was our main cours the seafood paella 

for a 36 share entre you would expect someth tasti that you cant wait to go back again for but it was aw the paella was it honest tast like rancid veget oil with boil veget and mushi rice i couldnt find ani chorizo or chicken which would have ad flavor the seafood was there but guess what total lack in ani kind of season the clam were also full of sand and it was veri unpleas have spit out grain of and with each bite i actual am get piss off think about this becaus our check was pretti damn high we actual left a littl hungri becaus we didnt want to finish the main coursgive this place one star in order to write my review

mi bf and i were there on thursday night we were both starv we sat down and were greet prompt we order an appet and a few differ tapas

bacon wrap date our favorit tapa came out super hot my bf burn his mouth the bacon was realli fatti which explain whi it was burnt

empanada had a mushi meat which resembl puré  old shred beefnot good

crocketa were deep fri but super soggi how doe that happen and who know what was in them it was suppos to be chicken with béchamel sauc but tast more like a campbel cream soupwait generic cream soup campbel wouldv actual help w chunk of who know what ive had béchamel sauc and that was not it

chorizo was serv cut into tini piec 5 piec altogeth and was so oili that some of the oil end on my shirtgoodby silk blend piec 

final we decid on gnocchipasta right you cant mess this dish up ive made it myself at home with otc saucewel surpris salti and gnocchi tast so un fresh

i will not return to this place serious my bf even said he would much rather take his chanc on the other more known tapa place then step back in here how is this place still have peopl come in and order food clear these peopl lack a train palat or mayb they lost their tast bud in a freak incid i went home and purpos made myself sick  i kept wonder what was in those crocketa and empanada the thought of how old the food wasit was too much for meill keep this short and to the point i just had bad turkey a few day ago  food poison came here out of curios sinc i was in the area i look at the menuand saw raw chicken sit on the counter gross i dont need anoth bout of food poison so i left obvious the 5star review here are fake hide your kidgiven just a 1 star for this particular locat is for the sake of it name other than that i would glad had given a zero if i could the other two locat on spring mountain are well rate becaus staff that actual acknowledg their custom unlik this locat 

was the veri first time for my famili and i to come here becaus of distanc so we decid to come here came insid no wait at all no one greet us wait at the door for a good 7 min then sat us took our order after 10 min waiter didnt give us ani special what they didnt have what wasnt in season etc order 3lbs of hot n juici season shrimp mild and 1lbs of crawfish with same season order didnt come out till 30 min later without ani lemon or butter not even the salt and pepper we basic had to ask for everyth that was alreadi suppos to be with our order order of food that wasnt our kept come to our tabl waiter were confus and didnt know which order belong to what tabl 

rip into the bag of shrimp which was over cook but was tasti and littl spici rip into the crawfish and the bag onli had 2 big piec and the rest were about a size of a quarter some even smaller believ it or not then ask the server if they had bigger one they can chang for me or exchang it with shrimp instead she then said oh theyr not in season which she was suppos to mention befor we order pass visit in other locat also with boil crab if she had mention that the crawfish was out of season then obvious we wouldnt have gotten that 

waiter then ask a fellow co worker man waiter on what to do he came to our table
and told us there noth we can do you can order what you want with the same charg that on the menu or take it off the bill veri rude so not onli did we wait a while for our food be the fact that my kid were hungri they didnt acknowledg or take care of their custom need by exchang what we want sinc it was wrong on their end 

at this point i was alreadi furious and want to leav i then ask for the check right away ruin our whole dinner and they even forgot to get my check so i went up to the regist wait for them to print out my check and they also charg me for extra butter and rice that i didnt ask for but i still paid it money wasnt the problem on my end while i was wait at the regist two custom got up from their seat and ask for hot sauc fork and spoon that show lack of custom servic someth has to be done perhap a more thorough custom servic educ i would rather drive the mile than to come back to this place i will never come back here i will stick to boil crab happi new yearwent on a saturday two week ago at about 830pm it was my birthday so there was 11 of us we were so happi to get there and it was not full

okay well first of all dont believ the review  i came here becaus it was recommend to me by yelp  never again  this place was an annoy to get to if your familiar with downtown las vega it right off fremont street at the apt name contain park  what that mean is that youll be park block away feed a meter and then walk to your destin rain or shine

so i final convinc myself to go  i was feel suicid which onli leav you two option kill yourself or get someth good to eat  i chose the latter this time  i expect this to perk up my spirit just a day befor lone christma but read on fellow yelpers

aft go out of my way to stalk this place and in less than bitter spirit i chose the threemeat combo in order to get it all out of the way that right pull pork beef brisket and rib  just rib  i had no idea what i was in for

paid the 15 oh did i mention im unemploy for the combo in addit to the 1 in the meter which i includ in the bill for the inconveni  food came quick the line wasnt too bad  here a roundup of the eats

1 pull pork  the best part of the plate  stringi  cold  but edibl  pour a bunch of extra bbq sauc on it becaus it is dry

2 beef brisket  hard  chewi  your forc to chew it for 5 minut then eventu swallow when your tire of chew  this stuff was terribl  not recommend at all

3 rib  not meant for human consumpt  i dont even know what part of the pig this was  the tendon  it was not even remot chewabl  i attempt to eat half of one then ask for a togo box for the remaind of the brisket and rib  ive never done that befor  usual i finish it all in one go  and that not a compliment regard the portions

on star not go back thank henriattend this establish last night for a friend birthday 

the build is a cool design and look great we were all excit to tri it out 

we sit at our tabl and are greet by our sever sarah 

i have to say i have never been treat so rude in all my life and either had the other peopl in our parti 

after have a round of drink and some starter out sever come over again to see if we would like to order we order more drink and our main meal 
the girl server ask some of us for our id and state i was 19 onc i know what you guy are like i was the youngest at the tabl and she didnt ask me

w are all late 20s to 30s and all profession go to what is suppos to be an up market restaur with a sever say comment like that it just doesnt float with me one of the girl didnt have her id meanwhil it her birthday
so the mood of the celebr chang the manag come out after our complaint to the sever and apologis there is noth he could do even after serv us drink prior

our parti felt so unhappi and uncomfort that we decid to leave
 
i went and ask for the chequ and explain due to the server be rude and the fact they now ruin our night we would like to pay for what we have had and leav to go somewher els 

the manag and i becam engag in a heat argument in the middl of the restaur start by him rais his voic at me becaus he said we order main and we have to have them or pay for them or he would call the polic for theft and not pay a bill who say that to a customer

i clear state we havent eaten the food and it was order in the middl of our complaint which hadnt been dealt with 

the manag proceed to inform me he would call the polic i said fine pleas do call them as i was ask for my bill to pay what we had had alreadi and it is not my fault that experi was ruin by rude peopl 

he then told me the i need to leav the restaur as i am trespass and if i didnt he would again call the polic meanwhil my parti was still at the tabl wait for me to return i compli to his request with the question what did i do other than complain 
is this realli how your restaur deal with complain by threaten to call the police

th manag continu to yell at me even when i was outsid final he calm down and said fine and gave me a bill for what we had eaten and drank and said pay this now

for a manag to yell scream and threaten a pay custom is disgust i have eaten at mani place all over the world and i have to say this was and most like will be the worst experi i have had at an restaur 

what happen to custom service

th fact the manag still request i pay after his and his staff member perform is an absolut joke 

clear the guy need to get a new profess becaus custom servic is certain not his thing 

we went to chelsea kitchen down the road and had a great experi after all that 

mayb the owner need to take old mate down there to chelsea kitchen to learn respect manner and custom service

just sayi had high hope for this place tri to go yesterday but they were close they alway are on monday and when i went in today it was to order the oxtail soup as advertis on a sign in their window they didnt even have it

but my bf is the thai expert order  fishcak app papaya salad and the basil garlic shrimp stir fri with bell pepper there was onli one other tabl dure our visit and it took near half an hour to receiv our food ill start with the positive

th fishcak were great not too greasi thick and flavor with a delight cucumb salad sauc that i ador well price at about 6

it was downhil from there
papaya salad had no discern papaya in it there was a white shred substanc that almost appear to be bean sprout and had no flavor we were told that was the papaya um no go bro plus it was pack with heat even at order a level 2 to the point that it was not enjoy to eat 

then the stir fri arriv there were sever shrimp in the dish and i could visibl see basil and bell pepper in a dark red sauc but the bell pepper were raw and the sauc was devoid of ani flavor other than spice no garlic no balanc the entre itself was serv on a plate so the sauc was all over the bottom of the dish and imposs to spoon onto the rice make it difficult to eat then again so did the heat and lack of flavor
thi is one of the onli dish in my life i have sent back

on star for the fishcak and becaus the server brought out the cook who was apologet and friend and offer repeat to remak the dish to tone down the sauc and cook the bell pepper we had no interest but he was polit and insist so we took him up on remak the dish and take it to go
edit tri the remad dish and the sauc is still the same the bellpepp is cook but now the shrimp is overcook and dri so disappointed

our bad experi doesnt end there though
a we left we were approach in the park lot by anoth diner who had left and wait for us to see if our dine experi was as bad as his was not a good sign at all 

the cook friend and polit though he is need to consid be front of hous or manag cook is not his strength and as a person prefer mayb find a differ serverhost who isnt wear a mickey mous shirt and play on the comput for our entir visiti am super disappoint with the new restaur i got realli excit when i saw the new time articl about it and decid to invit my famili to our neighborhood boat parad dinner at the watersh  i will prefac this with the hoa send a flyer out to the resid to come watch at the watersh so it was go to be a busi night 

we got a tabl and after 20 min final had someon ask us if we want someth to drink we order an appet so that we could look over the menu in this time there were about 4 server who tri to drop thing off at our tabl it was veri clear no one was proper train on the seat chart or whoever was run the restaur has no idea what number tabl is

20 minut later we had the queso fundido for 9 i wasnt impress with the amount of chees given onc the chees got cold the thin chip could no longer scrape it up off of the skillet

w then wait anoth 10 minut for our server to come back around to order more drink and food we  were quick told that we could order more drink but the kitchen was now close at 630 in the middl of the boat parade

bas we told him this is a joke and that we were done then becaus we had expect to be eat at this time he apolog but no offer of anyth to make us want to come back

whil wait for our check two server came by ask if we order the food they had this made us even more upset sinc we were just told the kitchen was close the last girl that came with food my mom made veri clear that it was ridicul that there was no food servic at 630 pm she said they had not prepar to have this mani peopl come to the restaur out of the 15 tabl there was definit not food at each one so not sure whi they would plan to onli feed 5 tabl a night 

we ask to have our check again and then were told that their system wasnt work we ad up our foodtax and got cash out becaus we were livid at this point 

on the way out we ask for the manag it happen to be the girl that tri to drop off food at our tabl  we told her how disappoint we were especi sinc we live in the neighborhood she basic broke down cri and said they would make it up to the communiti they still took our money and no  hint of wow we are sorri we basic made your night super shi pleas come back for a free appet on us 

everi aspect of this restaur show me that they have no restaur or custom servic experi i wont be back bc i would rather spend 15 on an entre somewher that i know will actual treat me like a custom 

side note we left and went to spoke on southern a go to place in the neighborhood that we alway enjoy we sat down water was instant brought and had a server within 5 minut we joke with them about our horribl night so far and the manag brought us a free appetizerbas anoth restaur tri to make up for the disast onemust have been a veri off night for this place walk in and told them it was our first time in we live in the neighborhood and were look forward to give this place a tri super sarcast hostess say yeah we are pretti awesom umm ok so we ask for tabl of 5 plus a high chair took them about 10 minut to figur out they couldnt seat us for at least an hour hostess was so rude said they dont normal seat parti of more than 4 what walk out front to find three empti 4top tabl walk back in to hostess and ask if they could push two togeth and she told me that not their polici and she would have to ask a manag even more attitud from her now i let her know i would like to speak to the manag at this point he turn out to be even less help than her we explain we live up the street etc he seem like he could care less just a side note here we are a clean cut marri coupl dress casual but nice late twenti with a beauti littl blondi babi and we liter live two second from here so bum at how lame this place turn out to be wont be back last thing we decid to eat at ha humbl pie instead turn out to be happi hour still and we were seat right away either amaz servic as usual and great foodif it were possibl to give 0 star i would 

our waiter was absolut condescend the entir time everi respons came with an exagger smile also dont tell us your busi when we ask for servic screw you peter 

we order 5 margarita no one at the tabl swallow their first sip premix splendasoak fakelim tequila juic is not someth i expect from a mexican kitchen 

the queso fundido was horrend they threw a block of curdl chees into a mini cast iron pot what i mean it tast like chees so it wasnt nasti but it was not queso fundido 

the rest of the food was palpabl but not close to memor 

sean the manag poor handl our concern also dont stuff your face with cupcak in your makeshift banquet area it not classi

th tap dancer and clogger were great but the rest of the show was yawn  for the ticket price i could have gone to much better shownice atmospher nice tryterr servic mediocr food sorri was expect a higher standard of hospit in a place like this

w were usher in like vip and then complet forgotten we have now been sit here for 30 minut stare at our empti glass and dirti plate wait on our second cours ani expect set by the standard of servic at the door have not been met great job host stand not so much everyon else

oh and now they just brought our first cours for the second time it just get better and better our glass are still empti the seat number have been wrong the cours has been assbackwardsoh godi do this for a live and i feel like an asshol im embarrass about how upset this is and that is just not an emot i should be feel in a place of this calib and price tag holi moli this is badthank you for an unbeliev horribl time last night to your credit your food is amaz absolut delici and at a level that i would expect for las vega unfortun your show was lack in content and your custom servic was atroci while we would love to have seen the show we spent a major of the time gaze at the other patron who kept enter after the show had start and who felt it necessari to stand up and direct block the view of everyon behind them 

but the worst thing was the fact that when we brought our concern to you the manag you did noth to make it right and simpli dismiss us at that point we had had enough and left 

whatev you do definit tri the food but skip the show andar your serious with the 25 cocktail realli theyr good but theyr not that good

i wont be backheard some good review of this place so ventur along for some thai treat one even the decor is realli quit nice and we were quick shown to a seat and present with a glass of water each 

lot of interest look choic on the menu and the restaur had a realli nice buzz as fellow diner got on with their even we had our choic sort and the waiter came over  differ person than who seat us 

order some tofu and were told that they had ran out which i found a littl odd for an asian restaur so that the menu option cut in half for my veggi dinner mate then 

inform the waiter that she is vegetarian she was cut off veri abrobt half way through and told you can have veget okay it your menu ani suggest mate nope noth he just stare at us and repeat the veget one this was all get a bit weird

aft all that theyv struck out 3 time and lost me as a customthis place open 12114 been watch them construct the place was excit to go thereit suck fox10 news lie big when the had these peopl on to promot they should be a shame of them selv to tell peopl to go there  when they tast the horribl food all my dish which is a la cart tast like fish insid smell like fish so i sat outsid i has a chicken taco pork taco both had no flavor and they give it to you in 1 tortillahello street taco come doubl stack had the columbian rice is was crunchi jasmin rice with lemon squeez on top the salsa was bad also had no flavor either noth had flavor my friend had the fish taco and said it was nasti they give you a 40oz empti bottl of beer fill with water tap im sure and the servic suck waiter ask if we want our check and forgot the lunch crowd was gone i had to get up and go insid and tell the guy did you forget us i do not recommend lucki i gave them 1 star guess i had 2 eat it piss i did and paid for ittaco haus servic is terribl while wait to give our initi order we had the same person come to our tabl twice with somebodi els food we wit her actual drop off an appet  to the wrong  tabl it was a group of peopl they each were  wonder who order it

w were about to leav when we were final ask  what we want we love brat haus so we figur it will be worth the wait  
we order a chees and chorizo dip with chip we also ask  for a side of salsa

th rest of the order is 5 carn asada taco one fish taco  one pork belli taco  and i think one chicken
 
we also order two beer and a mix drink i cant identifi from  memori right now 

we are brought soup which nobodi order we told the ladi this was not our then we are brought empenada which we also didnt order we tell her this is not our either she take it as if  it our fault we didnt order them 

then some of our drink come we get one of our beer and the mix drink the  second beer the guy say oh we dont have that im sorri i forgot we were out 


final our taco come with the substitut beer and then our appet come out slight after  fine we order them at the same time no big dealyoud think right

th appet was suppos to be melt chees and chorizo it stone cold to the point it hard no chip would pierc this wall chees 

im feel lucki for some reason so i order a second beer as the food was drop off

th  taco were tasti  they were good there is no deni that smaller portion than id have like but that understand for the price 

the waiter come back for that how everi thing tast check place do usual it occur right as you take the first bite of food no we had actual finish our taco  and there were bit chip  stick out of the concret chees  i told him that was cold and bad  and id like the check 

he come back give us the check and  tri to give us three  free margarita  we declin pay and when he bring our card back the elus second beer  show up  i assum the beer was lock in a deathmatch with the side of salsa  and onli one could emerg to victorious

our origin plan was to drink quit a few drink go see a movi and  then catch a ride home we spent liter two and a half hour  and paid over 50 to end up buy more drink at the nearbi safeway and stop at jack in the box for snack and go home 

this all could have been avoid if the staff knew what  they were do 

one other posit thing the peopl walk around fill the water glass were super attent and and alway there mayb they should be given some food to run out to tabl as well 

steer clear of taco haus especi if your a huge fan of brat  haus it make it so much more heartbreaki know go to a newli open restaur usual involv hiccup in food prepar and servic but i was not prepar for a massiv train wreck this restaur is not readi for prime time

i thought taco haus meant a place with lot of taco but realli they onli offer five taco a veggi chicken steak pork belli fish either grill or fri we order one of each  sinc they are small street taco a chicken mole empanada and street corn to share

our server said hed bring us salsa and sauc and did come back with bottl sauc but no salsas

first come out our chicken mole empanada i like the uniqu crispi shell of the empanada but i didnt recogn ani sort of mole there anywher a white slight herb cream was under the empanada and it was so mild season i couldnt tell what it was suppos to be but it was sort of tangi and i thought it might be tarter sauc whatev it was i didnt like it

th rotisseri chicken taco was memor becaus it was the dryest chicken i ever had and was like saw dust in my mouth and also was next to tasteless

th pork belli taco just seem like it was deep fri and also lack flavors

similar stori with the fri fish veggi steak taco and street corn everyth was under seasoned

mi grill fish taco was ined it was either spoil or next to spoil it tast like rot fish i did inform the waiter and he took it away and insist on bring me someth els i almost die in my head im think i realli dont want anyth everyth was terribl my husband ask for a veggi taco to replac the fish my waiter told me everybodi who had the grill fish said they didnt like it  if everybodi doesnt like it someth is wrong with it fish taco was remov from check and manag did apolog about the fish

and last the street corn was a terribl concoct it seem like old not so fresh water boil corn that got slight brown mix with popcorn and a spoon of mayo with so littl anyth els it had no resembl  or tast to street corn and had littl flavor on it own

i onli heard good thing about the chef from here but i serious worri about his pallet

everyth fell short

slight updat 2214
 fish taco have been remov from the menu sinc my reviewi had visit nekter two other time this week onc in the afternoon and yesterday morn i went for a third time this morn becaus their juic is quit good and also reason price compar to competitor after tell my friend about this place she ask me if i had a punch card with them it a pretti good deal spend 25 and get a free 16oz juic howev this was never offer to me and i didnt know about it until after i had purchas a few juic 

the reason for the 1 star review is becaus i walk in this morn befor work and there were two staff member at the regist one staff member was show the other how to do someth on the regist not a problem i understood this and im pretti forgiv but i was stand there two feet away from them wait and it was as if i was invis i wait some moreno hello no well be right with youno acknowledg at all feel super awkward and unsur of how long i was go to be ignor for i turn around left the store and went to jubi true across the street

i total understand the need to train someon to do their job but i think it common courtesi to at least acknowledg your custom im pretti sure i will not be return here as their custom servic was non exist this mornwe love eat here but pleas make sure to take a good long look at your bill befor you pay we have been charg the dinner price dure lunch time on two occas now the first time we did not realiz and left wonder whi our bill was so big yesterday we final caught on realli disappoint to see that they did that to us we left feel a bit betray but regardless we love the food here well just have to be extra cautious next time we come back

it sadden me to leav such a negat review after all the time weve been here but i just dont want the same thing happen to other custom the servic is decent the first coupl time we were here our order took a realli long time to get to us but the most recent time weve been the servic has been great the waitress actual recogn that were there almost everi week that whi i feel so betray becaus be regular i didnt think she could charg us like that twice and not expect us to catch on especi me becaus i myself am a serverwhere to start with a sushi place this bad

wel it not absolut horrid it just not good with terribl servic  as i write this first paragraph i am torn between two and one star  it been settl one star  let me tell you how i got there

food  the food is not good  i didnt get sick i didnt think the fish tast terribl it was all just so veri bland and off  we start off with one of the burrito which was fish krab cucumb and avocado wrap in rice and a rice paper wrap  this was the best thing we ate  we actual said to each other if this is what all their food is like were total sold on this place  that is howev where thing start to get wors  

we order about 2 dozen order of nigiri with various fish on top  salmon yellow tail tuna squid and scallop  my usual thought is that the rice should have sushi rice tast and the fish should be a decent thick with a good textur and a littl chilli  this place basic gave us plain rice littl to no vinegar tast with fish that i didnt know you could cut it that thin  the most confus part to me was that the fish was warm  not room temp but warm warm  like it been sit on top of an oven that was turn on and it didnt cook but got warm  this made my stomach question it fresh  

i also order a coupl of cut roll riceless roll and a hand roll  the alaska hand roll to be specif  or as i like to call it salmon slurri shove into seawe that look like a dog just puke up a piec of salmon gristl  i couldnt finish it to say the least  

food be mediocr ok that a 23 star score so whi the 1  service

aft 45 minut of be seat  we had order twice and eaten onc  funni how that is sinc their menu say order time limit is 45 minut  i mean serious 45 minut to cut fish in a restaur that is not busi on a friday afternoon  when i say not busi i mean there are 3 tabl that have peopl at it and 6 peopl at the sushi bar  45 minut the waitress respons for our tabl kept on walk past us and avoid eye contact and to add salt to the wound in the end she charg us for dinner price instead of lunch  

will i come back  no  do i think it worth suggest to other  no  

tldr  avoid at all cost  how doe this place have 45 stari was debat whether to stop at jjanga or sushi hous goyemon  i so wish i went to goyemon instead becaus i did not have a good experi at jjanga 

we got there a littl after 1230pm and it was not crowd we were seat and order right away the menu say you have 45 minut to eat for ayc lunch the servic was super slow i didnt get my 2nd plate until 45 min later i was think they better not kick us out id be so pissed

th first round of hamachi look incred and tast great the 2nd round of hamachi were poor look and was warm temperatur 

the onli fish that tast fresh were hamachi and salmon the rest of the fish i can pass 

i just cannot stand sashimi to be warm  just not sanitari 
and these fish werent thick cut either theyr quit thin sliced

som of the roll were okay spider roll was fine i wish they would serv us faster so i can tri differ item 

the waitress wasnt great also she forgot one of my order and charg us for dinner price instead of lunch and no matter how i tri to make contact with her or wave my hand around i cannot get her attent at all i was just annoy i was veri temp to just walk out the door and not pay becaus servic was that bad 

no i will not visit jjanga again i was glad that i didnt bring friend here it would have been an embarrassoh utah chain you have manag to disappoint me again i order takeout from blue lemon last night sinc it is close to work and it hard to find vegetarian fare in our cafeteria get takeout is confus becaus there is no separ line or regist i went on a busi friday night so i proceed to the espresso bar to skip the line

th girl work was the one who had taken my order i follow her over to the area where they were expedit food onli to find out that my order had never cross over to the kitchen she told me it would onli take a coupl minut for it to be readi i explain i was on a break from work and it need to be done as quick as possible

i wait 10 minut more for my order when someon final hand me a bag he ask is this your order i ask is that the black bean ravioli he answer i think so exasper i open up my togo box and he said is that right i dont understand how he didnt know what the dish was suppos to look like no one was remot apologet about the delay 

the ravioli tast okay but they didnt sauté the veget proper becaus it was made so quick after a while all i could tast was raw spinach and onion it took a lot of breath mint to get the tast out of my mouth

poor servic and poor food mean they wont be get a second chanc from mei was so excit to tri this place and unfortun i didnt like it 

came here tonight with my sister walk in and it cute clean bright and decor realli nice but the menus on the wall are so difficult to read the print is too small we were about the 5th group in line to order and wait about 20 minut to get to the counter it is an order at the counter and seat yourself kind of place which i like quit a long wait but no worri it new 

we order sweet potato fri artichok and spinach dip and a pear and gorgonzola salad the girl take the order were nice enough just slow move 

we take our sit and within 30 second our salad and fri are out first thing i think  ok so not fresh food boy was i right 

soggi fri with a veri weird almost tasteless dip im gonna go ahead and say those fri were frozen they went from warm to cold in about two minut 

the salad was especi not impress the pear was mushi and bruis cheap tasteless gorgonzola a few grape and carrot dress was ok but for 9 this was way overpr no chees bare and also small veri small 

the spinach artichok dip actual gross me out come with pita bread carrot cucumb and celeri the veggi were drip with water and again bruis cucumb the dip was horribl warm not hot and just not a good tast 

it hard to write this review for a place that i want to like so bad but the qualiti of food isnt there for a restaur that advertis fresh they may want to stop reheat their food 

1 star for decor and cleanli sorri charli i wont be backi have to admit i was like the earli review  excit to tri a new place that was healthi with a twist when you walk in blue lemon entic you with it clean open and airi layout and pop of color i was teeter between a salad or burger and from the staff recommend went for my protein intak so base on that i had high hope for the black and blue burger

i rare write negat review and even more rare send food back but this was the first except my burger was more than over char dri to the point that the hous fri sauc couldnt reviv the meat addit my sweet potato fri were so soggi it seem the temperatur got cross wire between the entre and side dish so i wait with anticip for the second attempt onli to discov my fri to be blacken and my burger not quit burnt but sure overdone

th staff is young and in need of strong manag for custom servic train no one check to see if the chef correct the first mistak and second my friend brought the redo to me veri disappoint for gilbert on this eateri and hope they can manag to turn thing around i think i would have been happier with a doubl doubl protein stylepink box has great donut but this locat is unreli we went in on sunday at 9am and were told they had no donut that day im not a donut expert but i imagin sunday is a good day to make sure your stock wast our time drive there stock up kidthis is a breastaur     hooter with a mountain theme  i alreadi know this will be a sausag venison fest with exclus miser husband at the bar escap with sports

ok this is where they start and went downhil from there  1  no game  good luck in vega franchis from texa  2  young pup hire for hair and implant and are exact 21 who dont know how to pour a manhattan or hold a crowd lot if stand around and pout  3 suppos to be sexi but exact one skinni bodi type  no bum no bodi divers  4  food suck and was    beer slushi and wing on par with denni  yum yum 

this place has been 4 differ concept and this will die out soon too  there is noth at all interest with food beer or girl  the girl are sweet but this is a hot mess of tri to be sexi when we see more on billboard here  alien 50 percent of the popul with sit2p bathroom and terribl servic to femal as evidenc by mani yelp review in other citi  not smart 

ok i got accus of be jealous by a fellow yelper  not true there are lot of place with sexi gal that i love pts gold treasur  but you also need to be a good bartend  if you dont know where fireston beer is from or where you get the venison in the chili from you are just eye candi  there is noth wrong with be sexi but if this is a dine spot and not a strip club then act like it  food and servic was wors than hooter  i didnt know that was possibl  you dont realli come to a place like this for anyth but the girl unimpress  grape on a celeri  no curv 

arkansa time agre with me  epic bad

they call it the worst most apathet swill ive ever eaten  ha ha ha yepaw  walk in right up to the hostess tabl to see four girl in convers  not one look up so after a few second i walk in myself and found my friend  15 minut pass befor the waitress show to take my drink order  15 minut after order my drink i left  as per my friend that stay my drink show up about five minut after i left  35 minut  for a jack and coke  the entir 30 minut i spent there i watch the waitress talk to one anoth  
manag if youd like this place to make it youd better make some serious chang in the cultur  i havent heard a good thing about your place yet  the world doesnt need anoth hooterthis entir compani exist as a cautionari remind that man or woman cannot live by ta alone

id offer you someth witti and insight about the food and drink if i was ever serv instead after 20 minut of be activ ignor by a parad of soror stereotyp nightmar masquerad as profession bartend i abandon the most empti breastaur in frustration

but perhap twin peak is not to blameaft all im the fool who chose to stop bythe first time we went here we sampl all of the differ juic and the owner sold us on the cleans packag tell us that if we return the bottl that they would give us 1 off per bottl 

when we got home late afternoon we notic 4 of the juic expir that day and we need to drink them that even not thrill  we didnt get the chanc to drink them all in time befor they expir 

we decid for us we would prefer to go buy the juic that we intend to drink instant when we went back today we brought the 12 bottl back and just want 2 drink  they told us that they would take the 12 bottl 12 off but onli give us 2 off this order with a receipt show an addit 10 bottl return  i explain that we onli intend to buy drink as we drink them so we wont ever buy 12 at a time again  they said that fine but we cant give you the discount

bottom line  they are will to give a discount of 1 per bottl return but they will onli do it bottl for bottl mean that they tri to lock you in to buy bulk i hate small busi that hide behind batenlockin polici over common sens and put the custom first 

custom servic is poor herethis is my mother review who is not activ yelper 

well all in my year of eat out and trust me there are mani i have never had such a terribl experi at a restaur befor i will never eat at oregano again we went to the new one in cave creek with our friend it was a 2 hour wait so after a half hour we order to go but they said if our tabl open up we can still sit so our tabl open befor our food was done and the staff sat us on the way we told her we had order from take out and she said no problem well after we were seat the waiter told the manag and he came over and accus us of steal a tabl when we explain that we had been wait on the wait list like everyon els and were seat by his staff he rude brought some of our food in the togo box even though we ask for it to be unbox when i ask about the rest of the food he made anoth rude comment it was so obnoxi that a women from anoth tabl turn to us and said how rude this man was that we would like to see anoth manag it turn out the owner show up at our tabl and ask if we would like him to call the polic on us becaus we were swear we thought he was joke at first but appar the waiter told him we were swear even the woman next to us was appal we got up and left i said i will put it on social media he said go ahead we wont be the first i can see whi if that is how he treat his custom he follow us to the car we did not want to talk to him our friend stay and explain i think he was a littl sorri when he heard the real stori and not just the waiter who didnt want to serv someon who had order which was stupid he would have gotten a nice tip for do half the work anyway the owner gave our friend a gift card but too littl too late peopl skill might have serv him much better no loss didnt realli care for the food anywayon my way to an appt today i stop in to have lunch and check it out  it is rare that i am out and about without my kid so i was look forward to an awesom lunch

i follow the sign point me to the regist to order and got in line behind a larg famili  i waitedand waitedand wait as about seven of them each place an order  sudden behind me i hear a voic say to go to anoth regist that open  i assum the voic is talk to me sinc i am next  but nosh is talk to the peopl behind me in line

r  how hard is it to take the next person in line  realiz with this kind of servic i would never make my appoint if i continu wait i left  my first impress of your restaur is one of disorgan and snide staff becaus when the woman realiz shed skip me she said she thought i was with the other group despit be behind them not with themand she should have ask  she made no effort to make amend and if manag can afford to let pay custom leav their veri first time visit shame on them

veri disappoint thought we final would have a neighborhood spot for our famili sinc sever of us live in the neighborhood but i guess not  not to mention the vibe in the place was pure chao which isnt a pleasant atmospher to dine intruli disappoint this restaur has so much potenti but seem to be run by those from the island of misfit toy i gave this place 2 chanc lunch and dinner our dinner experi was that of everyon els list took 2hrs for all of food to be brought and it came piec by piec over the 2hrs it was kid mac n chz cold  gross side of sweet potato fri cold and capres salad quit nice gave benefit of the doubt as they had open onli a few week ago and tri lunch today still horribl order our food at the regist offer my card to pay and was told it would be 35 min wait for a burger and salad realli i snatch my card back and told the gal to delet our order  she seem shock we wouldnt wait 

we will not return and have advis neighbor and friend of our experi there 

honest it seem the custom desper want this place to to be their neighborhood cafe but ppl wont wait forev for this place to get it act togeththis is for the eastern locat i love the one on tropicana but the eastern one is terribl it is a mess of a line and the servic is aw they advertis a special of buy 2 taco get one free not onli did they fail to honor there deal but than they mess up on my order go to the one on tropicana the food and servic is top notch and they treat the custom right the one on eastern feel like a differ restaur entir and not in a good waythis place symbol overr busi glamor by the media for no justifi reason

th lobster tail peopl are rave about  it was complet stale with tasteless cream this is just a cream roll that you can get for cheaper and better in a chinatown bakery
strawberri shortcak  averag cream could have use more flavor and tast less commerci and fattening
cooki  we tri one of each and none of them were good i liter took a bite and threw the rest away how is it possibl to make cooki that arent good

at this point you might think i sound like a negat snob and i attribut that to the amaz bakeri of san francisco  so i apolog for have standard the ice to this cake was that we wait 1 hour to order  receiv and most of the shelv were empti becaus they were sell faster than they could bake 

im still mad over the stale lobster tail  especi for the price we paid whi would you come hereso i cant comment on the food from here but the servic we receiv here today was noth short of inexcus im not one to post rant review as im in the servic industri out here and realiz most are bs 

we came in i the bakeri and pull a ticket look in the case at all the bake goodi and liter 30 second had gone by and they call the number befor we could see what number we where we ask a question about someth in the case and the clown behind the counter turn in to a ass respond in a aggress tone i have alreadi call that number three time what do you want now mind you we have been in the store a whop 3 minut the guy proceed to be a dick with the manag stand right besid him and act like everyth is fine when she realiz we are unhappi her onli respons was mayb he is have a bad day  i get it you dont reprimand employe out on the floor but you dont pretend like noth is wrong i could care less if your have a bad day welcom to the tourist industri buddi put on a smile and pretend to be nice to the peopl that come in to spend money we had famili that came into town a had two thing she want to do while she was here one was to go to this place shame on the clown behind the counter and shame on the manag for not be abl i do her jobthe singl worst pizza ive ever had in my life  see photo  it was imposs to eat and i cant believ a restaur would serv what they did  serious when this place is close soon i will not be surprised

th first warn sign  there were onli 4 custom in the entir restaur when we walk in  there were 11 peopl behind the counter work  it was weird they were all kind of just stand around and a few of them were just watch other work  restaur that arent busi and are empti are usual like that for a reason  we soon learn why

th pizza i order was a pepperoni oliv  pineappl  the woman make it was nice but i have to admit the pizza didnt even look all that great when it was be made  she use veri few ingredi it seem  for rough 15 for a person size pizza it seem averag at best while it was be made

i got to the cash regist to pay and a new cashier was be train that day  it took quit a bit longer than i expect  as i look around im think now that mayb even the cook and prep peopl were be train as well  there were what appear to be a few manag just stand around watch them like a hawk  it was odd  three month into a new restaur i wouldv expect thing to be run smoother

th pizza arriv  the edg were black on the crust and i like them that way  howev a closer glanc reveal that the entir interior of the pizza was either undercook or uncook  pick up the first slice it was clear that the thing was a complet mess  the entir pizza top slid off includ chees and everyth  i was left hold a wet piec of liter uncook dough with some tomato sauc  it was a rubberi mess and the entir middl of the pizza was drown in wet and was more of a soup than a pizza  the whole thing was gooey wet and runni  the crust was so thin and undon that it was a droop disast  each slice was like that  wateri drip and unabl to even stand up like a normal pizza slice  

it was ined  befor i left i scoop some of the souplik top on a fork and it didnt even tast good  the crust had no flavor at all  i will never be back and would implor anyon read this to think twice about ever step foot in this place  there a reason it end up on one of the lowerend vega properti like mont carlo rather than someplac like the cosmopolitan aria or caesar palace

eat at this place at your own peril  id give it zero star if i couldbeyond disappoint and embarrass to have taken my boyfriend parent here last night im a huge fan of guy fieri and was bum to miss his yelp elit event last month and was so excit to tri this place epic backfired

get this 
tripl t fri are delish but dont eat the creami white truffl dip no flavor seem to be sour cream oh and theyr 14 so consid yourself warned
th hefeweizen beer featur on the current menu is also damn delici too bad it took 20 minut and half of our meal to get to us

dont get 
morgan greek salad is plate poor and difficult to cut up and eat the full romain leav onli one piec of feta in the entir dish fell off the plate due to the plate issu and was unabl to eat it the dress was citrusi and not at all appeal onli greek compon of this salad were the feta i couldnt eat and a hand of oliv there was no hummus in this dish as list on menu and the crouton were soggy
th mayor of flavortown is a dri burger with pastrami of question qualiti somehow it look like brisket with a dark color and odd tast the dijon mustard was also flavorless serv with crinklecut sweet potato fri that look and tast like they were from the groceri store bulk bag did not finish

mayb take a gable
doubl barrel bbq wing are cut lollipop style which was visual pleas and easier for my bfs dad to consum and guy signatur bourbon brown sugar bbq sauc was neither bold nor flavor make it even more palat for a guy who hate spice but couldnt find anyth els on the menu he want to take a gambl on good dish for the person who order it but not someth i can recommend

servic was also aw as mention abov we wait 20 minut for our beer that is simpli unaccept we also order a margarita that tast like lemonad and did not seem to have ani liquor in it sent it back should have sent everyth back but at 1am our option were limit i didnt want to make a scene in front of my potenti futur inlaw and quit frank we never saw our server

receipt came in an iphon holder with the devic to complet a dine experi survey about our visit i would have love to but the iphon was out of batteri and shut off seriously

i am so embarrass to have suggest this place and will not be recommend it 
bad servic  bad food  bad experithe yusho stand for 

yu should not go to this place

at first i saw the sign and i was super excit i could not wait for this place to open it door becaus i love japanes style grill yakitori and robatayaki is the best and they have noodl too bonus

everi time i drove by the sign yusho japanes grill  noodl hous i could just imagin myself eat tender cut of char chicken and steak off of skewer and then slurp up delici noodl bath in brothi good  my mouth would water just at the thought of it i could not wait for this place to open it door becaus it such a perfect combo and there realli is nobodi on the strip do this at a reason price  

booomawaken from the dream

a i walk in i notic was there was a lot of outdoor patio furnitur clumsili arrang in front of the entranceuh oh i felt a disturb in the japanes feng shui forc 

make my way into the restaur i was greet immedi by a veri friend staff perhap too friendly

th restaur has a veri simpl atmospher not reminisc of ani kind street food dine i have ever encount it more like this cafeteria i went to at depauw univers in indiana that i was visit back in 1998   dark wood color and  a blend of white and yellow light that is confus mix with bad fabric and color that dont match  what ever happen to the good ol japanes feng shui i am not a feng shui expert but if i was i would give it 1 feng on a scale of 110 with 10 be a perfect feng shui   there was definit no feng shui consult involv in ani part of the design of this place 

the articl have prais yusho as a high end elev take on japanes street food when i think of japanes street food i think of cart line the street with smoke bellow off grill as delici cut of meat on skewer are char on the grill and ladl of noodl and steami bowl of brothi good are be serv in big bowl to a bustl crowd of hungri folk who onli have a 15 minut lunch break   

our order of elev japanes street food

chub sausag steam bun  no elev here it was just terribl couldnt eat more than one bite  terribl blood sausag sinc when is sweet and gritti good  i still get a littl sick just think about it 

duck leg w steam bun  no elev pretti standard on this if you want a littl duck and some bread and you have 25 to spare this will do if i was stuck on a desert island with onli a yusho restaur to surviv i would probabl just eat these 

chicken wing no elev i like my wing with a littl crispi to themther was no crispi  these were slimi and stuf with a  fill that made it tast like a chicken meatbal more than a wing  no yakitori or robatayaki flavor good present 

ramen noodl probabl the worst non elev precari balanc on the bowl was a  rectangular meat stick of what tast like panko crumb fri bumbl bee tuna  we were told it was pork  much better place for ramen in vega and at 22 for a small bowl this one made me realli wish i could just beam myself out of there immedi   where a feder starship when you need one  

the host server busser provid excel servic   sinc this restaur is part of the hotel we use our point for the meal and want to put a nice tip on a credit card becaus our waitress was the best ever and it not her fault she has a terribl product to work with  in come a clueless aggress girl manag who said they could not charg a tip on a credit card for the server and when i ask what they do when this happen she said that she encourag custom not to leav a tip she remind me of an angri badger after a brief exchang of word where i educ her on the concept of protect her staff  she scamper away to tri again and hallelujah she figur it out  obvious this is her first time as a restaur manag sorri awesom staff your inexperienc angri badger manag is too lazi to help get you tip and is definit the nail in the coffin for this place  

if this food was not elev  i think the tourist would like it and there would be a chanc of success tourist wont like the food and when they have an issu the badger will crush them   

it just unbeliev that this  elev street food is elev by non other than matthia merg the execut chef from the infam charli trotter in chicago arguabl the greatest restaur in modern chicago histori  the onli thing elev about this place is the price 

mathia i think it would be wise to make it an authent japanes street food experi  chang the menu and concept and fire the clueless manag 

overpr non elev bad  food dull atmospher with good staff except for the badger  yu should say sayonara to yushodecid to tri this place out sinc it new and we park at mont carlo to avoid traffic after the may weather fight  

after read all the posit review after be open for about 2 week hmmm someth fishi we decid to tri it
yelp review fail


i was veri disappoint with all the dish except for dessert  it is also way overpr for the amount and non qualiti dishes

to start we order the grill octopus  first off it is not grill it was mayb heat up in a pan second it was smother in the sauc and mushroom  the enoki were mushroom were good but over took the dish might as well just make an enoki dish

next we order the 2x fri chicken  this was over cook hard and chewi   mayb stick to just 1x fri chicken

next is the duck leg  this was actual pretti good  it was cook just right so it wasnt dry

now the crab fri rice terribl  this is japanes style food and they didnt even know how to cook rice  it was mushi almost like rice cake just plain bad they give you about a scoop and a half of this stuff for 24 

next was the ny steak  you are given 8 piec that are wrap in nori and cut like sushi  the steak was cook perfect med well with good flavor

last main dish is the logan ramen  this was more like bad cup o noodl  the noodl are dri noodl i swear they open a packag of top ramen and use half for this order  then the broth was salti chalki and sour  the cook obvious has never eaten ramen in his life  

we order green tea to hope wash down all this um stuff i guess you can call it becaus it wasnt food at all  even the tea was terribl  it was realli bitter and rancid  serious tast like weed and a sock were in the pot  the waiter later explain it is some type of jasmin tea although there was no scent of jasmin in the tea

now the dessert  these 2 were surpris palat  the fri doughnut were cook just right  the outsid had a crispi to it while the insid was soft  it was also like sugar with a hint of ginger  the second dessert was their homemad soft serv  this was real good  it had a chocol coffe flavor to it with pop rock  

overal the servic was great but the food was not good at all and waayyy overpr even be in a casino  

definit will not be come back herei was realli excit to tri anoth new place in vega the review were great and i love bachi burger the food was realli good but 5 hour later i got realli sick i had the corn beef hash and a cup of coffe  it too bad becaus the food was realli good now the thought of the hash make me cring  i call the manag just to let them know she said she would do some research and call me back she didnt no worri though i didnt want to call but my boyfriend insist they know  my friend had the pancak and said they were good she was fine

pro creativ corn beef hash recip 
             kona blend coffee

con eat someth there that got me realli sick all nighti had my assist call the crack egg to ask for an owner i could send the below letter to curti got on the phone wouldnt give his last name and yell at my assist so with no other outlet than yelp here the letter

to whom it may concern

i live veri near the new crack egg restaur at charleston and hualapai my inquisit 3yearold daughter watch with great anticip as the new muffin store was be built and the morn of 42714 i took her there she was veri excit i would normal bring my wife and 1yearold son but my wife was home sick with a cold

what follow was the worst custom servic experi of my life given the recent open of the restaur wait staff and hostess were understand unpract and the oper wasnt run as smooth as i expect it will over time howev when i complain to the manag about needless wait for 15 minut after it was our turn to be seat a man approach me and with no introduct or convers prompt escort me out the front door my 3yearold daughter ride on my hip and rude and loud told me to get in my car leav and never come back i encourag him to listen to me his custom and he rude told me look around are you the onli one here with an infant 

im not a loud larg or scarylook man in fact im a 47yearold wellrespect member of the busi communiti i serv on two high profil communiti board and own and oper a small local busi suffic it to say ive never been ban from ani establish and found the whole experi horrifi especi in light of have my young daughter with me

th saddest part of this experi is my 3yearold daughter now speak unsolicit about the bad man at the crack egg who wouldnt let us have pancak and bacon she shouldnt have to worri about face hostil at ani of our neighborhood establish it shameful

sincerely
jeff gwould give zero star if i could over ten dollar for four doughnut no price list no descript list and the doughnut were so greasi you could tast it my hand was cover in it we didnt even finish them just toss them out will never go back go to pinkbox insteadi am so so so disappoint that i have to write this review  ive been look forward to martinez taco bar ever sinc i read it was come to the aliant marketplac  i wait a coupl week befor tri hope that ani issu would be work out  im so veri sad to say that this place is aw and i will not be return unless some major chang occur

th restaur itself is small but clean and nice  the decor is a littl cheesi but bright and cozi  i like the outdoor seat option  the woman at the counter was nice and the cook was super slow  it took about 15 minut for 2 taco and this was after the dinner rush on a week night

i order 2 street taco one steak and one pork  the meat was liter just gristl  it was so bad that i couldnt tell the steak from pork by tast  also the top were pathet  mayb 2 cilantro leav and 4 piec of onion  so stingi  the tortilla are store bought and they were gross  someth was also way off with the temperatur  i took 2 bite from each taco and threw them away and i hate wast food  

mayb after some good qualiti control the soda machin had 3 of 6 flavor out of order and more generous fresher ingredi mayb this place can be save  for now id eat anyth at taco bell over this place  thumb downi visit vega for work and ive been the past 2 week  ive been wait for giada to open for a long while so i immedi tri to book a reserv  the phone number list never got me to a live person and when i tri to book onlin it push me out to juli  i thought i would just sit at the bar so i walk over twice and both time was told that i couldnt even walk up and see the place without a reserv  i will write a new review onc i get a chanc to tri the place  not impress so far  give us some directhonest not sure how this place is hold up with 4 star review on yelp becaus our dine experi was total disappoint the place is real nice design so prop for not screw up one of the best view on the strip 
we had a parti of 7 for my engag celebr check in and got the grand tour befor we were seat 
decid it would be best to order a littl bit of everyth from the chicken meatbal to prosciutto and someth els that wasnt worth rememb chicken meatbal were pretti dri and flavorless howev the mushroom they were stack were pretti tasti 
the item on the drink menu were pretti good
for the main cours i had the rack of lamb and my fiancé went with the filet rack of lamb was dryer than the chicken meatbal were which tell me that they had no clue how to cook or prepar lamb now the sad part was that my girl filet was super dri over cook and basic not a good cut
our friend went with with porterhous which was decent some other got the lemon spaghetti and anoth pasta dish 
end the dinner  with the strawberri shortcak type dessert that was bleh cooki were pretti good with the espresso 
now despit the crappi food the place is real nice and i dont realli mind that it suck becaus we cant judg til we tri it right be vega i would probabl not go back becaus honest italian food is pretti bland in my opinion and there alway new place to tri in vega 
the onli real bad part of the experi was that they end up charg me and extra 260 after i call the next day and spoke to the general manag he inform me that they were have problem and that his financi dept will take care of it said i will have a call back the next day and that if i dont hear back to give them a call ive follow up and still cant get this issu clear up which is a littl annoy 
hope this review will motiv them to take a closer look at their dish and also fix the error on my check after read the glow review on facebook i decid to make the short drive to deforest and check out bb jack  after suffer through some servic issu and some lacklust food i learn two things
1 never trust facebook for restaur review didnt mean to cheat on you yelp it just you were slow on the draw on get this new restaur listed
2 i will not be return to bb jack anytim soon

mi daughter had a late soccer game in waunake so i decid to call in a carryout order for a pizza and a reuben sandwich  i was told that my order would be readi in 15 to 20 minut just the amount of time i need to drive from waunake to deforest  thing were look good

i arriv 15 minut after i call check in at the bar and lo and behold my pizza was readi to go  i paid for my order the bartend brought my pizza to the bar and thank me for my order  one small problem no reuben sandwich  when i ask the bartend about it status i got a confus look and he scamper into the kitchen  he came out told me it was not readi yet and then tend to the other custom at the bar which was pack on a thursday evening

so i waitedand waitedand wait  

and i watch my pizza get colderand colderand colder

on of the server sit at the bar told me the kitchen prepar the pizza in a separ area from the rest of the food  uh ok a use fact if i ever get a question about bb jack kitchen oper dure trivia night but what i realli want to know if when my sandwich will be ready

aft ten minut anoth server saw me impati wait by the bar and ask if i have been help  i explain my situat and he check with the kitchen to check on the status of the sandwich  he indic it will be a coupl of minut and offer me a drink while i wait

th sandwich show us thirteen minut after my pizza and i hit the road

th good news first the tater tot that accompani my sandwich were well prepar  hot crispi on the outsid and not too greasi  the folk at bb jack have mad deep fri skill  i could have done without the powder parmesan chees sprinkl on top but if that their signatur touch so be it 

to say my reuben sandwich was dismal would be an understat  the main ingredi of the bb jack reuben is a thick layer of bland sauerkraut which turn my sandwich into a soggi mess by the time i got it home  the bread was supermarket qualiti marbl rye and need to be cut thicker to hold up to the all the wet kraut  the sad layer of corn beef was excess salti  the 1000 island dress had the consist of warm jello  it was a paintbythenumb sandwich use institut grade ingredi  

the half pepperoni  half chees pizza also was a bust  the crust was on the thin side and had no chew and littl flavor  the sauc was appli uneven with some spot swim in sauc and other with just a trace  the chees had a strang filmi qualiti  i had a coupl of piec and it was so bad that it had me question my belief that there is no such thing as a bad slice of pizza  the capper was that my daughter found a hair on one of her slice  it was so bad that we didnt even keep the leftov the uneaten slice were dump in the garbag with nari a complaint from my family

aft my dismal experi i wrote messag the owner of the restaur to express my disappoint with the qualiti of my experi  to their credit i receiv a prompt respons from the restaur manag apolog for the mixup on my carryout order

i realli hate to dole out one star rate but given the problem with my carryout order and the weakass food the dread eek methink not descript is apropo given my lacklust experiearlier today i was in henderson i didnt want to drive back on my side of town to get to babi stacksbuffalo and flamingo so i had a oh what the heck attitud and went to this babi stack 

whi did i rate 1 star i was veri disappoint in this babi stack my girlfriend and i order 2 full stack of pancak we wait almost 40 minut for our order to come thru what made me realli mad is that we didnt even get ani compens like a discount or even free side dish like hash brown even befor we could order our waiter didnt even greet us nor take our order in a time manner so after 40 minut of wait we final got our meal the pancak tast bland and they were also burnt at this point i didnt want to make a scene so i forc ate my burnt pancak and want to leav 

never again will i ever go to this locat and to be honest i feel like this place is just hype some of the price for food are just ridicul for the amount of food you get i feel like most of the food they serv you can make at home let be real for the amount of food they give you qualiti of the food bad servic do you realli want to spend your hard earn money herewent here tonight i know it onli been open 1 day but there are some serious flaw in the concept  the food was ok noth veri good  it is crazi expens  i know it the strip but you are pay 6 for 4 tini shumai  or 9 for a bowl with 1 cup of rice 14 cup of beef and 2 strip of pickl ginger  i got the bbq duck and pork plate 16  the duck was bad there was no meat on ani of the bone and it was super fatti  they did not render the fat out  the pork was pretti good  the pork bao was not veri good the bao was the frozen varieti  after ask for a beer and get a crazi look from a girl at their bar i ask if they were still open  she shrug her shoulder and said she didnt know  5 minut later i saw anoth guy at the bar i told him what happen  he apolog and got me an asahi draft for 919

ok despit the price there are other issu  the present is wors than panda express  there is no thought put into how the food look  the whole set up is super confus  there are some sign and price but some booth have no sign or veri minim sign  plus you have to pay at everi booth  you want bao wait in line and pay  ramen  wait in line and pay  beer  hope someon is there wait and pay  my friend order shumai and sinc it so disorgan they gave it to someon els after her  veri poor set up  ultim for the price you expect better food and service

i know they open yesterday and it a beauti space but quit frank this concept is not work in it current state  i wish them the best but i wont be backi had high hope for this place when i heard that it was open asian food in the heart of vegass newest attract the linq that sound like good news to me and good is what i was expect unfortun my hope were shot down soon after watch my friend order food 

they have a boba place insid as well as a place where you can order dish like a restaur and a place where you can order food down a line like panda express look at the price that they had at the boba place it was a littl prici and i cant expect it to have that much better qualiti than somewher off the strip and so i deem the price a littl higher than normal i understand rent must be expens but they wont be make money with higher price 

the area where you can order food had a varieti of dish from differ asian cuisin but this again was a littl expens i cant imagin it tast ani better than somewher off the strip at a specif ethnic restaur and especi for the price they were charg 11 for fri rice is a littl much they also have dim sum  dumpl and they list it out what kind they have on the window the price are a littl expens for how much they give you which is the usual 4 at tradit dim sum place 499 for an order is not worth get while you are there you might as well go out somewher els off the strip for dim sum 

the area where you can pick out food like at panda express was also prici and it didnt look veri good it seem as though it was sit out there for a while when my friend order food from there she got the duck and they microwav it you know when your at home at theyr leftov it ok to microwav food but when you order food from outsid of your own home that aint cool bro that right there was just shock for me that a place would even do that so i dont think the food will look too appet unless it came fresh out of the kitchen just make sure they dont microwav the food befor they give it to you

last but not least when my friend food was finish they brought the food out to where we were sit when the waitress or whatev categori you want to put them in brought out her food the tray didnt have utensil and the waitress said she forgot and ask her to get it herself umm i think that a littl bit rude to say and you have a job where you most stand right next to the front anyway so i dont understand whi she couldnt have just gotten them right after 

i dont mind the higher price of the place insid the linq i can at least understand that much but when you have unapp food microwav food and have bad servic that a big nono there eat befor you go to the linq if you canthis place need some serious work i admir the decor it look realli hip and fresh but food wise this place is way too expens and honest poor qualiti 

fame seem like it set up to be like a modern asian market place with vendor line up kind of like a lunch line there was fuku burger at one end of the area which my friend end up eat at and said it was pricier than the food truck i chose to go to the opposit side of the area where they showcas duck and pork hang kind of like sam woo bbq if anyon is familiar with that restaur i order the duck and pork combo and switch the rice out for noodl lomein possibl which came out to 18 while i definit thought this was way overpr for someth tri to mimic an asian market where price are cheap as hell helloooo ie philippin thailand etc i still gave it a fair shot  

still the qualiti of food was garbag i liter saw them microwav the duck they didnt cut it from the duck hang in the window and when the server brought the food to my tabl she forgot my utensil and said oh shoot i forgot to give you utensil can you just get them smh also the manag scold one of his worker in front of me for not give someon a number card realli not profession 

the food tast old not fresh and the duck was soggi the pork was reason but definit not 18 worth the noodl were soso oili and not veri flavor and the side veget were oili and also not fresh 

if this place want to surviv they need to cut price work on qualiti of food big time and work on custom servic i was realli disappoint with this place be wariit dq so i didnt expect much howev i did expect they could get a blizzard right this place sent out coupon state to come on down and tri out their new locat i show up to find a close sign and construct tool were scatter all over the insid kind of a disappoint but i figur id just check back the follow week when i went back there was a sign on the door state they would be open that night i figur they would need to pull off a miracl becaus the same tool were all over the place the sign said they would be open though and the sign wasnt there the previous week so i went back that even same tool everywher and they werent open someon did show up to at least remov the sign 

a coupl week later they final open i stop in to get a mini blizzard with rees and oreo i sat at a tabl and wait about 10 minut when a girl brought out a dip cone for me what i didnt order that so i show her my receipt and she said she would make what i order right away she threw away the dip cone such a wast and went to make what i hope would be what i order as she walk back out she realiz she made a medium blizzard instead of a mini and proceed to throw it away to go back and make me the right size sinc i paid for a mini and not a medium with the wast of the 2 ice cream she threw out i dont see how give me the medium she mistaken made to me would have been a big deal the blizzard was decent howev the whole ordeal of get it wasnt a good experi at all cant say ill be backfinal was abl to get in without a day where the line was out the door  my son has the pork rib and lean brisket i had a pull pork sandwich and we share the new potato   
mi sandwich was sooo greasi that the bottom bun was complet soak my son lean brisket was even more greasi   the was paper that the item are serv on were so soak  they rip on us my son like his rib but let me warn you 3 rib are a half a pound and did noth to fill him up   the new potato are liter cut up red potato swim in melt butter    the bbq sauc has hard ani tast    will not be go againok sooo i had never eaten here befor until i work herethank god i didnt wast my money here
